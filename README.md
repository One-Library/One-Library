The One Library is a public service project which serves to archive and curate various resources in
the public domain, which range from major historical texts to open source digital assets.

<h3>Contents</h3>

#### [The Philosophy Section](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/tree/master/The%20One%20Library/1%20-%20Philosophy)

The Philosophy section of the One Library contains all of the Library's plain text written
documents, including its archived texts and references for them.

#### [The Wonders Section](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/tree/master/The%20One%20Library/2%20-%20Wonders)

The Wonders section of the One Library contains all of the Library's assets that are not plain text
documents.

In addition to its [digital asset archive](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/blob/master/The%20One%20Library/2%20-%20Wonders/2%20-%20Assets/1%20-%20Art/),
it also contains [links to various external archives](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/blob/master/The%20One%20Library/2%20-%20Wonders/1%20-%20References/1%20-%20Guides/1%20-%20Archives/README.md),
[references to external assets](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/tree/master/The%20One%20Library/2%20-%20Wonders/2%20-%20Assets),
and [commentary on the contents of the Philosophy section](https://github.com/One-Library/One-Library/tree/master/The%20One%20Library/2%20-%20Wonders/1%20-%20References/2%20-%20Navigation/README.md).

<h3>Format</h3>

All of the written documents in the library have been mapped to the ONE and ONE+ text formats,
which is where the One Library gets its name from.

[ONE](https://github.com/Atlas-of-Kaeon/Atlas-of-Kaeon.github.io/blob/master/Kaeon%20United/3%20-%20Wonders/1%20-%20Documentation/1%20-%20Guides/2%20-%20ONE/1%20-%20ONE/README.md)
uses minus signs and tab indentation to separate text into a hierarchy of "blocks" without relying
on any escape characters.

[ONE+](https://github.com/Atlas-of-Kaeon/Atlas-of-Kaeon.github.io/blob/master/Kaeon%20United/3%20-%20Wonders/1%20-%20Documentation/1%20-%20Guides/2%20-%20ONE/2%20-%20ONE%2B/README.md)
is a superset of ONE which provides more ways to encode text blocks, and is thus easier to write
manually.

This format allows the documents to be easily read as plain text, to clearly convey the structure
of their content, and to be easily scraped by computer programs.

The documents in the library will generally follow a convention where a "Philosophy" section is
used to state the overall purpose of the document, and a "Principles" section in used to contain
the main content of the document.

The text of said documents will generally be wrapped at one hundred characters, assuming the width
of each tab is four characters.

<h3>Spliced Content</h3>

Many of the documents in the library were originally written in languages other than English.

As such, the library will generally use the most universally respected English translations of
them.

If there is no clear standard for an English translation of a given text, the library may use a
custom amalgamation of various translations.

Occasionally, it may use one standard for the text itself and a different standard for the layout
of the text.

<h3>Motto</h3>

The motto of the One Library is "Love of Wisdom".

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

Some of the texts contained within the library contain sensitive and controversial content that may
understandably offend some people.

The One Library does not condone any form of discrimination, hatred, violence, or supremacy.

However, the One Library does hold that even the most sinister of texts must be preserved so that
we may learn from them and from their impact on history.
