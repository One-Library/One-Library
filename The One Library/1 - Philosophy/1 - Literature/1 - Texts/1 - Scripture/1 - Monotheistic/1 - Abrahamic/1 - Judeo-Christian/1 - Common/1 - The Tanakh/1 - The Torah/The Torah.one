					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no

					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
						dream, behold, a vine was before me;
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and
						her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe
						grapes:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them
						into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three
						branches are three days:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee
						unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after
						the former manner when thou wast his butler.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray
						thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of
						this house:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also
						have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
						Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on
						my head:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
						Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three
						baskets are three days:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and
						shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he

						butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the
						cup into Pharaoh's hand:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 40: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

			-
				Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41
			-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
						and, behold, he stood by the river.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and
						fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill
						favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the
						river.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
						favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn
						came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after
						them.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh
						awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he
						sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
						thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
						interpret them unto Pharaoh.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults
						this day:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of
						the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
						according to the interpretation of his dream.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain
						of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each
						man according to his dream he did interpret.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored
						unto mine office, and him he hanged.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of
						the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in
						unto Pharaoh.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none
						that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst
						understand a dream to interpret it.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
						Pharaoh an answer of peace.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of
						the river:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well
						favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
						favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for
						badness:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten
						them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full
						and good:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind,
						sprung up after them:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the
						magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed
						Pharaoh what he is about to do.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven
						years: the dream is one.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven
						years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven
						years of famine.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 28
				-
					-
						This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do
						he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of
						Egypt:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty
						shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the
						land;
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine
						following; for it shall be very grievous.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the
						thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him
						over the land of Egypt.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take
						up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up
						corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of
						famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not
						through the famine.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his
						servants.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a
						man in whom the Spirit of God is?
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
						there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my
						people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
					-
				-

						Egypt.
					-
				-

						And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand,

				-
					-
						And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried
						before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

						was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
					-
				-
					Book 1 - Genesis: Chapter 41: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left

				-
					-
						And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every

				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give

				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 4

					-
						And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so

				-
					-
						And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall,

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call

					-
				-

				-
					-
						The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau

					-
				-

						Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That the LORD spake unto me, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them
						not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old

						A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed
						the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
						stead even unto this day:
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims,
						which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will
						neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for
						money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell
						in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the
						LORD our God giveth us.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy
						God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might
						deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the
						cities which we took.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city
						that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong
						for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any
						place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto

						Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all

						didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan,

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his
						bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of
						Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of
						it, after the cubit of a man.
					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I

					-
				-
					Book 5 - Deuteronomy: Chapter 3: Verse 14
				-

					-
						Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not
