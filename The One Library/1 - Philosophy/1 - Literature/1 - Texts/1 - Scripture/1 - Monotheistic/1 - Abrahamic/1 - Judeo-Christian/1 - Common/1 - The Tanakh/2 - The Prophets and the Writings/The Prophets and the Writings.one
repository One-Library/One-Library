				-
					-
						Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do

					-
						Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you,

				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and

						the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

					-
				-

					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
						saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an
						harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in
						hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that

						search out all the country.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was
						dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 6
				-
					-

				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land,
						and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the
						land faint because of you.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you,
						when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the
						Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly
						destroyed.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did
						there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your
						God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed
						you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and
						give me a true token:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and
						my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our
						business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we
						will deal kindly and truly with thee.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon
						the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet
						you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned:
						and afterward may ye go your way.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which
						thou hast made us swear.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
						thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring
						thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's
						household, home unto thee.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into
						the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and
						whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
						if any hand be upon him.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath
						which thou hast made us to swear.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away,
						and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days,
						until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout
						all the way, but found them not.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over,
						and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell
						them:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all
						the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of
						us.
					-
			-
				Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3
			-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and
						came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before
						they passed over.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the
						host;
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant
						of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall
						remove from your place, and go after it.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by
						measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must
						go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the
						LORD will do wonders among you.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant,
						and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant,
						and went before the people.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the
						sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I
						will be with thee.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant,
						saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall
						stand still in Jordan.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the
						words of the LORD your God.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and
						that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the
						Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the
						Amorites, and the Jebusites.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over
						before you into Jordan.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every
						tribe a man.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests
						that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the
						waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the
						waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over
						Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the
						priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan
						overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap
						very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came
						down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut
						off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on
						dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on
						dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.
					-
			-
				Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4
			-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan,
						that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out
						of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye
						shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where
						ye shall lodge this night.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of
						Israel, out of every tribe a man:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God
						into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his
						shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of
						Israel:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their
						fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before
						the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters
						of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the
						children of Israel for ever.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
						stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according
						to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them
						over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where
						the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they
						are there unto this day.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until
						every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the
						people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted
						and passed over.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the
						ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the
						people.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of
						Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake
						unto them:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto
						battle, to the plains of Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they
						feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up
						out of Jordan.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of
						the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the
						priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan
						returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did
						before.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month,
						and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in
						Gilgal.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall
						ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan
						on dry land.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until
						ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he
						dried up from before us, until we were gone over:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it
						is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
					-
			-
				Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5
			-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the
						side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by
						the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before
						the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
						neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of
						Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and
						circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at
						the hill of the foreskins.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came
						out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the
						wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that
						were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt,
						them they had not circumcised.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all
						the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed,
						because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware
						that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their
						fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
						circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised
						them by the way.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that
						they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of
						Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto
						this day.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the
						fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the
						passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of
						the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did
						eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes
						and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword
						drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou
						for us, or for our adversaries?
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And
						Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him,
						What saith my lord unto his servant?
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from
						off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did
						so.

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I
						commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have
						also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own
						stuff.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but
						turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed:

						among you.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow:

						ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and

						by man.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be

					-
				-

						So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes;

				-
					-
						And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites:

				-
					-
						And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD

						done; hide it not from me.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD
						God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred
						shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I
						coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the
						midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the

						all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD

				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all
						the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into
						thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her
						king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a
						prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua

						night.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the

						ready:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city:
						and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first,
						that we will flee before them,
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city;
						for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will
						flee before them.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on

					-
				-

						Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode

				-
					-
						And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and

						now there was a valley between them and Ai.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 12
				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north

						that night into the midst of the valley.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose
						up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and
						all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that
						there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 15

					-
						And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 17
				-

				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 21

				-
					-
						And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the

				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the

						Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is

					-
				-

						them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
						commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 8: Verse 34

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us,

						us.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day
						we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be
						rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the

						Kirjathjearim.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the
						congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the
						congregation murmured against the princes.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us,

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from

						God.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy
						servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you
						all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before
						you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have
						done this thing.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the

				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua
						had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and
						her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of
						Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the
						royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof
						were mighty.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and
						unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir
						king of Eglon, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made
						peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king
						of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,
						gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and
						encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack
						not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and
						help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are
						gathered together against us.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and
						all the mighty men of valour.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them
						into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
						night.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great
						slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to
						Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going
						down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon
						them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones
						than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the
						Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,
						Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged
						themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher?
						So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down
						about a whole day.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD
						hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at
						Makkedah.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men
						by it for to keep them:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of
						them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God
						hath delivered them into your hand.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end
						of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that
						the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace:
						none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five
						kings unto me out of the cave.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the
						cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the
						king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that
						Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the
						men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of
						these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good
						courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye
						fight.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five
						trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua
						commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the

						which remain until this very day.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
						and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that
						were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he
						did unto the king of Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and
						fought against Libnah:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of
						Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that
						were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he
						did unto the king of Jericho.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on
						the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king
						thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein;

						destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 10: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they
						smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains

					-
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-

					-
						There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their

				-
					-
						But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir,

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 4
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 7
				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these
						cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh
						also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at
						the sea:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is
						his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on
						the east.
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that

				-
					-
						And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to

					-
				-

				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh,

						one lot only:
					-
				-
					Book 6 - Prophets - Joshua: Chapter 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it
						down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the

				-

						And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 28
				-

				-
					-
						Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal?

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece
						together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will

						there be dew.
					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 6: Verse 40

						valley.
					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 6
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 9
				-
					-

					-
				-

				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto

					-
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-

				-
					-
						Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray

				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 11: Verse 21

				-
					-
						While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns,

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 11: Verse 27
				-
					-

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead,

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without

				-
					-
						Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to

				-
					-
						And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 11: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came

					-
				-
					Book 7 - Prophets - Judges: Chapter 11: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said,

				-
					-
						And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her

					-
				-

						Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his

					-
				-

				-
					-
						So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity

					-
				-

				-
					-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 16: Verse 2
				-
					-

				-
					-
						And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the

						looketh on the heart.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 16: Verse 8
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 14

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no,

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 17
				-

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 20

					-
						And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I

						LORD liveth.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee;

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 24
				-
					-
						So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king
						sat him down to eat meat.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the

						was empty.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something
						hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month,
						that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son,
						Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to
						day?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to
						Bethlehem:
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the
						city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have
						found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my
						brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou
						son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen
						the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy
						mother's nakedness?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 31
				-
					-
						For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be
						established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for
						he shall surely die.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall
						he be slain? what hath he done?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it
						was determined of his father to slay David.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 34
				-
					-
						So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the
						second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father
						had done him shame.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And
						as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had
						shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And
						Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 39
				-
					-
						But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry
						them to the city.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the
						south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times:
						and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David
						exceeded.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of
						us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and
						between my seed and thy seed for ever.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 20: Verse 43

						Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at

						with thee?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a
						business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business
						whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have
						appointed my servants to such and such a place.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under
						mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept
						themselves at least from women.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have
						been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels
						of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though
						it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the
						shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day
						when it was taken away.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear

						because the king's business required haste.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest
						in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the
						ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that
						here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 10

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 21: Verse 12
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to
						seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went
						in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the
						cave.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said
						unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou
						mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut
						off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto

						seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to
						rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul,

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold,
						David seeketh thy hurt?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee

						for he is the LORD'S anointed.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in
						that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and
						see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have
						not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

				-

				-

				-
					-
						And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me:

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 24: Verse 19

						And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and
						she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but
						the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of
						Caleb.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get
						you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to
						thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were
						with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all
						the while they were in Carmel.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men

						whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those
						words in the name of David, and ceased.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the
						son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man
						from his master.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed
						for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told
						him all those sayings.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they
						girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and
						there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by
						the stuff.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David
						sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed
						on them.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we
						any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the
						fields:
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with
						them keeping the sheep.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined
						against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of
						Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of
						wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and
						an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid
						them on asses.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.
						But she told not her husband Nabal.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of
						the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met
						them.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in
						the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him:
						and he hath requited me evil for good.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that
						pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell
						before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity
						be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear
						the words of thine handmaid.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as
						his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I
						thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing
						the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
						thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil
						to my lord, be as Nabal.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let
						it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will
						certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles
						of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my
						lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the
						souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a
						sling.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord
						according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall
						have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 31
				-
					-
						That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord,
						either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged
						himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then
						remember thine handmaid.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent
						thee this day to meet me:
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day
						from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 34
				-
					-
						For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back
						from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely
						there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth
						against the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 35
				-
					-
						So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto
						her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and
						have accepted thy person.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like
						the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was
						very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the
						morning light.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 37
				-
					-
						But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
						and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and
						he became as a stone.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that
						he died.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD,
						that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath
						kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of
						Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take
						her to him to wife.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake
						unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said,
						Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of
						my lord.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of
						hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and
						became his wife.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 43
				-
					-
						David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his
						wives.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 25: Verse 44
				-
					-
						But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of
						Laish, which was of Gallim.
					-
			-
				Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26
			-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide
						himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three
						thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of
						Ziph.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the
						way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him
						into the wilderness.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very
						deed.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David
						beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of
						his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about
						him.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the
						son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul
						to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay
						sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his
						bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand
						this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even
						to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his
						hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or
						his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S
						anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster,
						and the cruse of water, and let us go.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and
						they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for
						they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon
						them.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill
						afar off; a great space being between them:
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,
						Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that
						criest to the king?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to
						thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for
						there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are
						worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed.
						And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at
						his bolster.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And
						David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what
						have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his
						servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an
						offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the
						LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance
						of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the
						LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth
						hunt a partridge in the mountains.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do
						thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I
						have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 24
				-

						And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 26: Verse 25

						Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do

						And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of

					-
				-
					Book 8 - Prophets - 1 Samuel: Chapter 27: Verse 2

						And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with

				-

				-
					-
						Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a

						time mourned for the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 5

				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field,

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 8
				-

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 10
				-

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against
						the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is
						faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king,
						it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will
						now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be

						and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray
						thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the
						king now speak.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the
						woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can
						turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath
						spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the
						mouth of thine handmaid:
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:
						and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know
						all things that are in the earth.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go
						therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the

						his servant.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my
						face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his
						beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was
						no blemish in him.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled
						it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed
						the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would
						not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he
						hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the
						field on fire.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him,
						Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,
						that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?
						it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see
						the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 14: Verse 33
				-
					-
						So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom,
						he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the
						king: and the king kissed Absalom.
					-
			-
				Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15
			-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 1

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was
						so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment,
						then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said,
						Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there
						is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every
						man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him
						justice!
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he
						put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for
						judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I

						Hebron.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If

						LORD.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 9

						And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon

					-
				-
					Book 9 - Prophets - 2 Samuel: Chapter 15: Verse 11

				-
					-
						And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 6: Verse 33

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 8
				-

				-
					-
						He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of

						wrought all his work.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 15
				-

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 17
				-
					-

				-

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 22

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 24

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the
						borders were between the ledges:
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and
						cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the
						lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four

						at the side of every addition.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the
						mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half:
						and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare,
						not round.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels

						cubit.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their

						molten.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high:
						and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were
						of the same.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he
						graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of
						every one, and additions round about.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one
						measure, and one size.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and
						every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left
						side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house
						eastward over against the south.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made

						LORD:
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of
						the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
						pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that
						were upon the pillars;
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which
						Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 46
				-
					-
						In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between
						Succoth and Zarthan.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding
						many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD:

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the
						left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of
						gold,
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the

						of the temple.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD.
						And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;

						The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before

				-
					-
						Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and

				-
					-
						And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 16

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him,

						And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 19

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 20
				-

						And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David

						And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant,

						against the king.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the
						God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 32

					-
						(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for

						Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 11: Verse 35
				-

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt,

						Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 5
				-

						And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his

						this people?
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people
						this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to
						them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and

						before him:
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people,
						who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon
						us lighter?
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus
						shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father
						made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say
						unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 13

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 17
				-

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 22
				-
					-

				-
					-
						Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren
						the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is

						depart, according to the word of the LORD.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went
						out from thence, and built Penuel.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 29

						And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 12: Verse 33
				-
					-
						So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day

				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar,

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God,

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according

				-
					-
						And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 13: Verse 9
				-

					-
				-

				-

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 10 - Prophets - 1 Kings: Chapter 13: Verse 34

						And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a

						Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures

				-
					-
						Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted:

					-
				-

						Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my

				-
					-

				-
					-
						By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,

						And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 24

						Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

				-
					-
						Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou

						saying,
					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 27

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 28
				-
					-
						For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long:

					-
				-

						And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 30
				-

						Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

				-
					-
						Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 29: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the

				-

				-
					-
						But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 36: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 36: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 36: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 36: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 36: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 2
				-

						But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken

				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 3
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 6
				-

						Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 8
				-
					-

				-

				-
					-
						For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from

				-

				-
					-
						Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there,

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 37: Verse 18

					-
				-

						Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the

				-
					-
						Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword,

					-
				-

						Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son

					-
				-

						Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king,

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to
						Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like
						to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in
						the city.
					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence

						before he die.
					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast

					-
				-

					-
				-

						Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 16
				-

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 19

						And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 20

					-
				-

						But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall

					-
				-

				-
					-
						So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans:

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 38: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king,

					-
				-

						Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 13 - Prophets - Jeremiah: Chapter 39: Verse 6

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with

					-
				-

				-

				-
					-
						And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the

				-
					-
						But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom

					-
				-

						Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were

					-
				-

					-

				-
					-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the

				-
					-
						And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen,

				-
					-
						And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the

				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they

						turned not as they went.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 10: Verse 12
				-

				-
					-
						And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 10: Verse 17
				-
					-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief,

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron,

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the
						midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will
						bring you forth out of the midst of it.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord
						GOD.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the
						hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my
						statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of
						the heathen that are round about you.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and
						all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 18

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and

						of flesh:
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them:

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have
						eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by

						in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious
						house.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for

						forth into captivity.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in

						I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff

						brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their
						sight.
					-
				-

					-
				-

						For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come

						They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the

						Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination,

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 13: Verse 8
				-

						Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen

						Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall:

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 13: Verse 12

						For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in

						Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought
						them into the wilderness.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man
						do, he shall even live in them.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them,
						that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked
						not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he
						shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I
						said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume
						them.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the
						heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not
						bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and
						honey, which is the glory of all lands;
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but
						polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make
						an end of them in the wilderness.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the
						statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile
						yourselves with their idols:
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
						them;
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that
						ye may know that I am the LORD your God.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my
						statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall
						even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out
						my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it
						should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I
						brought them forth.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 23
				-
					-
						I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would
						scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes,
						and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers'
						idols.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments
						whereby they should not live;
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through
						the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the
						end that they might know that I am the LORD.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them,
						Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in
						that they have committed a trespass against me.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 28
				-
					-
						For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine
						hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick
						trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented
						the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour,
						and poured out there their drink offerings.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye
						polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after
						their abominations?
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 31
				-
					-
						For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the
						fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and
						shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord
						GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We

						stone.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 33
				-
					-
						As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a
						stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the
						countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a
						stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I
						plead with you face to face.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt,
						so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress
						against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn,
						and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I
						am the LORD.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 39
				-
					-
						As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye

						but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 40
				-
					-
						For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith
						the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land,
						serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your
						offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy
						things.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 41
				-
					-
						I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land

						to your fathers.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have

						evils that ye have committed.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my

					-
				-

					-
						Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the
						south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith
						the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour
						every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not
						be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned
						therein.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 20: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?

			-
				Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21
			-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 1

				-
					-
						Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the
						holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against

						thee the righteous and the wicked.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked,
						therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from
						the south to the north:
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou
						shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall
						melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may

						every tree.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 15
				-

						The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

				-

				-
					-
						Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 20
				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to
						open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to

						fort.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 21: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to

						The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

				-
					-
						Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 7
				-

						Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 23: Verse 11
				-

						And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her

					-
				-

				-
					-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent

				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 8
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits;

					-
				-

						And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 41: Verse 26

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 2

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the

						middlemost from the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 9
				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were

						goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their
						doors.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed

					-
				-

				-
					-
						He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred

					-
			-
				Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43
			-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 1
				-

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east:
						and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even
						according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the
						visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell
						upon my face.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 4
				-
					-

				-
					-
						And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of
						the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of
						Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more
						defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my

						consumed them in mine anger.
					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far

					-
				-
					Book 14 - Prophets - Ezekiel: Chapter 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be

				-
					-
						And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of

						That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should

						And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.

				-
					-
						Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

						Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of

					-

				-

						And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
					-
				-

					-
						He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 27

						He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 29
				-
					-
						So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 30
				-
					-
						They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in
						their mouths,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote

					-
						For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

						When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 37
				-
					-
						For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his
						covenant.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 38
				-
					-
						But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
						them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up
						all his wrath.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 39
				-
					-
						For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and
						cometh not again.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 40
				-
					-
						How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 42
				-
					-
						They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 43
				-
					-
						How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of
						Zoan:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could
						not drink.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 45
				-
					-
						He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs,
						which destroyed them.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 46
				-
					-
						He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the
						locust.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 47
				-
					-
						He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 48
				-
					-
						He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
						thunderbolts.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 49
				-
					-
						He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and
						trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 50
				-
					-
						He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave
						their life over to the pestilence;
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the
						tabernacles of Ham:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the
						wilderness like a flock.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain,
						which his right hand had purchased.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 55
				-
					-
						He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance
						by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
						testimonies:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were
						turned aside like a deceitful bow.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 58
				-
					-
						For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to
						jealousy with their graven images.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 59
				-
					-
						When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 60
				-
					-
						So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among
						men;
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's
						hand.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 62
				-
					-
						He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his
						inheritance.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual
						reproach.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of
						Ephraim:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 68
				-
					-
						But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath
						established for ever.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 70
				-
					-
						He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 78: Verse 71
				-
					-
						From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his

					-
				-

						Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the

						They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the

					-
				-

						Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake

				-
					-
						They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with
						Moses for their sakes:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his
						lips.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 34
				-
					-
						They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 35
				-
					-
						But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their

						polluted with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection

				-
					-
						Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel,

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the

					-
				-
					Book 27 - Writings - Psalms: Chapter 106: Verse 46
				-
					-
						He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

						I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;

						For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

						None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of

						For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of

						That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which

						For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

				-
					-
						And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man

				-
					-
						Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her

					-
				-
					Book 28 - Writings - Proverbs: Chapter 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

				-
					-
						And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil

					-
				-
					Book 28 - Writings - Proverbs: Chapter 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

						Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
					-
				-

				-
					-
						So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
					-
				-
					Book 28 - Writings - Proverbs: Chapter 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

					-
				-

						With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of

				-
					Book 28 - Writings - Proverbs: Chapter 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a

						Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my
						neighbour's door;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the
						judges.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine
						increase.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they
						contended with me;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I
						answer him?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in
						the womb?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of
						the widow to fail;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten
						thereof;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have
						guided her from my mother's womb;)
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 19
				-
					-
						If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
						covering;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece
						of my sheep;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in
						the gate:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from
						the bone.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness
						I could not endure.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 24
				-
					-
						If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my
						confidence;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 25
				-
					-
						If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten
						much;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 26
				-
					-
						If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 28
				-
					-
						This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have
						denied the God that is above.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 29
				-
					-
						If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself
						when evil found him:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 31
				-
					-
						If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we
						cannot be satisfied.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the
						traveller.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 33
				-
					-
						If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my
						bosom:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me,
						that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would
						answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 37
				-
					-
						I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go
						near unto him.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 38
				-
					-
						If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 39
				-
					-
						If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners
						thereof to lose their life:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 31: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words
						of Job are ended.
					-
			-
				Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32
			-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his
						own eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the
						kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified
						himself rather than God.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had
						found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men,
						then his wrath was kindled.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and
						ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine
						opinion.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth
						them understanding.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye
						searched out what to say.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced
						Job, or that answered his words:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not
						man.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him
						with your speeches.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no
						more;)
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 17
				-
					-
						I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like
						new bottles.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 20
				-
					-
						I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give
						flattering titles unto man.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 32: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon
						take me away.
					-
			-
				Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33
			-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter
						knowledge clearly.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
						me life.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of
						the clay.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be
						heavy upon thee.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy
						words, saying,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity
						in me.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater
						than man.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his
						matters.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in
						slumberings upon the bed;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the
						sword.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones
						with strong pain:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 20
				-
					-
						So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were
						not seen stick out.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 23
				-
					-
						If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to
						shew unto man his uprightness:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the
						pit: I have found a ransom.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of
						his youth:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall
						see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 27
				-
					-
						He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that
						which was right, and it profited me not;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 28
				-
					-
						He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see
						the light.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of
						the living.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 32
				-
					-
						If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify
						thee.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 33: Verse 33
				-
					-
						If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.

			-
				Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34

				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with
						wicked men.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself
						with God.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God,
						that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit
						iniquity.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find
						according to his ways.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert
						judgment.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole
						world?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his
						breath;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my
						words.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is
						most just?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are
						ungodly?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor
						regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his
						hands.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight,
						and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 22
				-
					-
						There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity
						may hide themselves.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into
						judgment with God.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 24
				-
					-
						He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their
						stead.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so
						that they are destroyed.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 28
				-
					-
						So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the
						cry of the afflicted.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his
						face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or
						against a man only:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 30
				-
					-
						That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will
						not offend any more:
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 32
				-
					-
						That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no
						more.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou
						refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou
						knowest.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 36
				-
					-
						My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for
						wicked men.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 34: Verse 37
				-
					-
						For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and
						multiplieth his words against God.
					-
			-
				Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35
			-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35: Verse 1

						Elihu spake moreover, and said,
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more
						than God's?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit
						shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
					-
				-
					Book 29 - Writings - Job: Chapter 35: Verse 5

						Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than

						I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
					-
				-

				-

						I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart

					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of
						fruits:
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth
						trees:
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I
						had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in
						Jerusalem before me:
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and
						of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights
						of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in

					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my

					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour

						spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can
						the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already
						done.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and
						I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even
						to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this
						also is vanity.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever;

						how dieth the wise man? as the fool.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is
						grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have

					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which
						I took under the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in

						his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart,
						wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh
						not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
					-
				-
					Book 33 - Writings - Ecclesiastes: Chapter 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and

						that it was from the hand of God.
					-
				-

					-
						For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
					-
				-

				-
					-
						For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge,

						that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and
						vexation of spirit.

						But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his

				-

						Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the

						And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath
						not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath
						not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all
						the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they
						shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The
						king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but
						she came not.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 20

						And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published

						And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province

						After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
						remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that
						they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And
						the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai,
						the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been
						carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
						Babylon had carried away.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she
						had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom
						Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard,
						and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to
						the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house,
						to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
						speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged
						to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the
						king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the
						house of the women.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged
						her that she should not shew it.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to
						know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that
						she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so
						were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with
						oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for
						the purifying of the women;)
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given
						her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second
						house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain,
						which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the
						king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai,
						who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she
						required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the
						women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that
						looked upon her.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth
						month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and
						favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal
						crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants,
						even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave
						gifts, according to the state of the king.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai
						sat in the king's gate.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had
						charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she
						was brought up with him.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's
						chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth,
						and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and
						Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 2: Verse 23
				-

						And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore

					-
						After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha

						were with him.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and
						reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But
						Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto
						Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not
						unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would
						stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was
						Haman full of wrath.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed
						him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews
						that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of
						Mordecai.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king
						Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day,
						and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered
						abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom;
						and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's
						laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I
						will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the
						charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of
						Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also,
						to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first
						month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto
						the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province,
						and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the
						writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of
						king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to
						destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old,
						little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 14
				-

						The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the

				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and
						put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and
						cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's
						gate clothed with sackcloth.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree
						came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping,
						and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the
						queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to
						take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had
						appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to
						know what it was, and why it was.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was
						before the king's gate.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of
						the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the
						Jews, to destroy them.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at
						Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto
						her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make
						supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know,
						that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the
						inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to
						death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
						he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these
						thirty days.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou
						shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there
						enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou
						and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art
						come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye
						for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my
						maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not
						according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had

					-
			-
				Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5
			-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel,
						and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's
						house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over
						against the gate of the house.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,
						that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the
						golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the
						top of the sceptre.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy
						request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman
						come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther

						prepared.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition?

						the kingdom it shall be performed.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king
						to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman
						come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow
						as the king hath said.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman
						saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him,
						he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and
						called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his
						children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he
						had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the
						king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I
						invited unto her also with the king.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting
						at the king's gate.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be
						made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that
						Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto
						the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be
						made.

				-
					-
						And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh,

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 3

						And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 5

				-
					-
						So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the

						whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the

					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the

						at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
					-
				-
					Book 34 - Writings - Esther: Chapter 6: Verse 11

					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 28
				-

						But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to

						As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what

				-
					-
						Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to

						earth.
					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh

						shall it break in pieces and bruise.
					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part

						strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry
						clay.
					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the

					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle

					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,

						shall stand for ever.
					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 35 - Writings - Daniel: Chapter 6: Verse 25

						Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell

					-
				-

				-
					-
						I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit,

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up,

						Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 5: Verse 9

						Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of

					-
				-

						Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards,

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 5: Verse 12
				-

						Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so

				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 5: Verse 13
				-

						Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house,

					-
				-

						But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the

					-
				-

				-

				-
					-
						Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep;

						Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian,

						doors upon the gates;)
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it,
						that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the
						wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem,

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 8
				-

						Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest,

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of
						Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house

						they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 11

						And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this
						prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and
						that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 14
				-

						My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their

					-
				-

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the

				-

						Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah,

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law

					-
				-

				-
					-

						And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the

					-
				-

					-
				-

						And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok

					-
				-

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us,

					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 13: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark
						before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged
						that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my
						servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on
						the sabbath day.
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 13: Verse 20
				-

						So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the

						they no more on the sabbath.
					-
				-
					Book 37 - Writings - Nehemiah: Chapter 13: Verse 22
				-

						And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that

					-
				-

					-
						And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak

					-
				-

				-
					-
						And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and

					-
				-

						Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations

					-
				-

						And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son

						For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel

						Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 7

						Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the

						And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.

				-

				-
					-
						But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his

						According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 18

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou,

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy

						hast said.
					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever,

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 17: Verse 27

						Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it

				-
					-
						He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to

					-
				-

						But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 19: Verse 4

					-
				-
					Book 38 - Writings - 1 Chronicles: Chapter 19: Verse 10

						Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he
