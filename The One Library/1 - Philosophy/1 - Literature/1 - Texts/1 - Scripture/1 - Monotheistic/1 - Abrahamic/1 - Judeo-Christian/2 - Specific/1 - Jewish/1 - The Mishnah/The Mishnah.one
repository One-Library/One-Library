							From what time may one recite the Shema in the evening? From the time
							that the priests enter their houses in order to eat their terumah until
							the end of the first watch, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say:
							until midnight. Rabban Gamaliel says: until dawn. Once it happened that
							his sons came home late from a wedding feast and they said to him: we
							have not yet recited the evening Shema. He said to them: if it is not
							yet dawn you are still obligated to recite. And not in respect to this
							alone did they so decide, but wherever the sages say “until midnight,”
							the mitzvah may be performed until dawn. The burning of the fat and the
							pieces may be performed till dawn. Similarly, all the offerings that
							are to be eaten within one day may be eaten till dawn. Why then did the
							sages say “until midnight”? In order to keep a man far from
							transgression.

							From what time may one recite the Shema in the morning? From the time
							that one can distinguish between blue and white. Rabbi Eliezer says:
							between blue and green. And he must finish it by sunrise. Rabbi Joshua
							says: until the third hour of the day, for such is the custom of the
							children of kings, to rise at the third hour. If one recites the Shema
							later he loses nothing, like one who reads in the Torah.

							Bet Shammai say: in the evening every man should recline and recite the
							Shema, and in the morning he should stand, as it says, “And when you
							lie down and when you get up” (Deuteronomy 6:7). Bet Hillel say that
							every man should recite in his own way, as it says, “And when you walk
							by the way” (ibid). Why then is it said, “And when you lies down and
							when you get up? ” At the time when people lie down and at the time
							when people rise up. Rabbi Tarfon said: I was once walking by the way
							and I reclined to recite the Shema according to the words of Bet
							Shammai, and I incurred danger from robbers. They said to him: you
							deserved to come to harm, because you acted against the words of Bet
							Hillel.

							In the morning he recites two blessings before it and one after it; in
							the evening two before it and two after it, one long and one short.
							Where they the sages said that a long one should be said, he may not
							say a short one; where they said a short one he may not say a long one
							Where they said to conclude with a blessing he is not permitted to not
							conclude; where they said to not conclude with a blessing, he may not
							conclude.

						-
							If one was reading in the Torah the section of the Shema and the time
							for its recital arrived, if he directed his heart to fulfill the
							mitzvah he has fulfilled his obligation, but if not he has not
							fulfilled his obligation. In the breaks between sections one may give
							greeting out of respect and return greeting; in the middle of a section
							one may give greeting out of fear and return it, the words of Rabbi
							Meir. Rabbi Judah says: in the middle one may give greeting out of fear
							and return it out of respect, in the breaks one may give greeting out
							of respect and return greeting to anyone.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 2: Mishnah 2
					-
						-
							These are the breaks between the sections: between the first blessing
							and the second, between the second and “Shema,” between “Shema” and
							“And it shall come to pass if you listen” between “And it shall come to
							pass if you listen” and “And the Lord said” and between “And the Lord
							said” and “Emet veYatziv” (true and firm). Rabbi Judah says: between
							“And the Lord said” and “Emet veYatziv” one should not interrupt. Rabbi
							Joshua ben Korhah said: Why was the section of “Shema” placed before
							that of “And it shall come to pass if you listen”? So that one should
							first accept upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven and then
							take upon himself the yoke of the commandments. Why does the section of
							“And it shall come to pass if you listen” come before that of “And the
							Lord said”? Because “And it shall come to pass if you listen” is
							customary during both day and night, whereas the section “And the Lord
							said” is customary only during the day.

						-
							One who recites the Shema without causing it to be heard by his own
							ear, he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yose says: he has not
							fulfilled his obligation. If he recited it without pronouncing the
							letters succinctly, Rabbi Yose says he has fulfilled his obligation.
							Rabbi Judah says: he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recites it
							out of order, he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recites it and
							makes a mistake he goes back to the place where he made the mistake.

							A bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema on the first night until
							the end of the Shabbat, if he has not performed the act. It happened
							with Rabban Gamaliel who recited the Shema on the first night after he
							had married. His students said to him: Our master, have you not taught
							us that a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema. He replied to
							them: I will not listen to you to remove from myself the Kingship of
							Heaven even for a moment.

							Rabban Gamaliel bathed on the first night after the death of his wife.
							His disciples said to him: Master, have you not taught us, that a
							mourner is forbidden to bathe. He replied to them: I am not like other
							men, I am very delicate.

							When Tabi his Rabban Gamaliel’s slave died he accepted condolences for
							him. His disciples said to him: Master, have you not taught us that one
							does not accept condolences for slaves? He replied to them: My slave
							Tabi was not like other slaves: he was a fit man.

							One whose dead relative lies before him is exempt from the recital of
							the Shema and from the tefillah and from tefillin. The bearers of the
							bier and their replacements, and their replacements’ replacement, both
							those in front of the bier and those behind the bier those needed to
							carry the bier, are exempt; but those not needed to carry the bier are
							obligated. Both, however, are exempt from saying the tefillah.

						-
							When they have buried the dead and returned from the grave, if they
							have time to begin and finish the Shema before they get to the row,
							they should begin, but if not they should not begin. Those who stand in
							the row, those on the inside are exempt, but those on the outside are
							obligated.

							Women, slaves and minors are exempt from reciting the Shema and putting

							Hamazon (the blessing after meals).

						-
							One who has had a seminal emission utters the words of the Shema in his
							heart and he doesn’t say a blessing, neither before nor after. Over
							food he says a blessing afterwards, but not the blessing before. Rabbi
							Judah says: he blesses both before them and after them.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 3: Mishnah 5
					-
						-
							If a man was standing saying the tefillah and he remembers that he is
							one who has had a seminal emission, he should not stop but he should
							abbreviate the blessings. If he went down to immerse, if he is able to
							come up and cover himself and recite the Shema before the rising of the
							sun, he should go up and cover himself and recite, but if not he should
							cover himself with the water and recite. He should not cover himself
							either with foul water or with steeping water until he pours fresh
							water into it. How far should he remove himself from it and from
							excrement? Four cubits.

							The morning Tefillah (Shacharit) is until midday. Rabbi Judah says
							until the fourth hour. The afternoon Tefillah (Minhah) until evening.
							Rabbi Judah says: until the middle of the afternoon. The evening prayer
							has no fixed time. The time for the additional prayers (musaf) is the
							whole day. Rabbi Judah says: until the seventh hour.

							Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakaneh used to pray as he entered the Bet Hamidrash
							and as he left it a short prayer. They said to him: what is the reason
							for this prayer? He replied: When I enter I pray that that no mishap
							should occur through me, and when I leave I express thanks for my
							portion.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 4: Mishnah 3
					-
						-
							Rabban Gamaliel says: every day a man should pray the eighteen
							blessings. Rabbi Joshua says: an abstract of the eighteen. Rabbi Akiva
							says: if he knows it fluently he prays the eighteen, and if not an
							abstract of the eighteen.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 4: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							Rabbi Eliezer says: if a man makes his prayers fixed, it is not true
							supplication. Rabbi Joshua says: if one is traveling in a dangerous
							place, he says a short prayer, saying: Save, O Lord, Your people the
							remnant of Israel. In every time of crisis may their needs be before
							You. Blessed are You, O Lord, who hears prayer.

							If he is riding on a donkey, he gets down and prays. If he is unable to
							get down he should turn his face towards Jerusalem, and if he cannot
							turn his face, he should direct his heart to the Holy of Holies.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 4: Mishnah 6

						-
							If he is traveling in a ship, on a wagon or on a raft, he should direct

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 5: Mishnah 1
					-
						-
							One should not stand up to say Tefillah except in a reverent state of
							mind. The pious men of old used to wait an hour before praying in order
							that they might direct their thoughts to God. Even if a king greets him
							while praying he should not answer him: even if a snake is wound round
							his heel he should not stop.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 5: Mishnah 2
					-
						-
							They mention God’s power to bring rain in the blessing for the
							resurrection of the dead. And they ask for rain in the blessing for
							fruitful years. And havdalah in “Who grant knowledge.” Rabbi Akiva
							says: he says it as a fourth blessing by itself. Rabbi Eliezer says: in
							the thanksgiving blessing.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 5: Mishnah 3
					-
						-
							The one who says, “On a bird’s nest may Your mercy be extended,” or
							“For good may Your name be blessed” or “We give thanks, we give
							thanks,” they silence him. One who was passing before the ark and made
							a mistake, another should pass in his place, and he should not be as
							one who refuses at that moment. Where does he begin? At the beginning
							of the blessing in which the other made a mistake.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 5: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							The one who passes before the ark should not respond Amen after the
							blessings of the priests because this might confuse him. If there is no
							priest there except himself, he should not raise his hands to recite
							the priestly blessing, but if he is confident that he can raise his
							hands and go back to his place in his prayer, he is permitted to do so.

							How do they bless over produce? Over fruit of the tree one says, “Who
							creates the fruit of the tree,” except for wine, over which one says,
							“Who creates the fruit of the vine.” Over produce from the ground one
							says: “Who creates the fruit of the ground,” except over bread, over
							which one says, “Who brings forth bread from the earth.” Over
							vegetables one says, “Who creates the fruit of the ground.” Rabbi Judah
							says: “Who creates diverse species of herbs.”
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 2
					-
						-
							If one blessed over fruit of the tree the blessing, “Who creates the
							fruit of the ground,” he has fulfilled his obligation. But if he said
							over produce from the ground, “Who creates the fruit of the tree,” he
							has not fulfilled his obligation. If over anything he says “By Whose
							word all things exist”, he has fulfilled his obligation.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 3
					-
						-
							Over anything which does not grow from the earth one says: “By Whose
							word all things exist.” Over vinegar, fallen unripe fruit and locusts
							one says, “By Whose word all things exist.” Over milk and cheese and
							eggs one says, “By Whose word all things exist.” R. Judah says: over
							anything which is cursed they do not bless at all.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							There were several kinds of food before him: Rabbi Judah says that if
							there is among them one of the seven species, he blesses over that. But
							the sages say: he may bless over which ever one he wants.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 5
					-
						-
							If he blessed over the wine before the meal he has exempted the wine
							after the meal. If he blessed over the appetizer (parperet) before the
							meal, he has exempted the dessert (parperet) after the meal. If he
							blessed over the bread he has exempted the appetizer/dessert
							(parperet), but if he blessed over the appetizer/dessert (parperet) he
							has not exempted the bread. Bet Shammai say: he has not even exempted a
							cooked grain dish.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 6
					-
						-
							If those at the table are sitting upright, each one blesses for
							himself. If they are reclining, one blesses for them all. If wine came
							during the meal, each one says a blessing for himself. If after the
							meal, one blesses for them all. The same one says the blessing over the
							incense, even though the incense is not brought until after the meal.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 6: Mishnah 7
					-
						-
							If they brought in front of him salted food at the beginning of the
							meal and bread with it, he blesses over the salted food and thereby
							exempts the bread, since the bread is ancillary to it. This is the
							general principle: whenever there is one kind of food that is the main
							food and another that is ancillary, he blesses over the main food and
							thereby exempts the ancillary.

							Three that have eaten together, it is their duty to invite one another
							to say Birkat Hamazon. One who ate demai, or first tithe whose terumah
							has been separated, or second tithe or sanctified property which have
							been redeemed, or an attendant who has eaten as much as an olive’s
							worth of food, or a Samaritan may be included in the three. But one who
							ate untithed produce, or first tithe whose terumah has not been
							separated, or second tithe or sanctified property which have not been
							redeemed, or an attendant who has eaten less than the quantity of an
							olive or a Gentile may not be counted.

							Women, children and slaves they do not recite an invitation over them.
							How much must one have eaten in order for them to recite an invitation?
							As much as an olive. Rabbi Judah says: as much as an egg.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 7: Mishnah 3

							How do they invite one another to recite the Birkat Hamazon? If there
							are three, he the one saying Birkat Hamazon says, “Let us bless Him of
							whose food we have eaten.” If there are three and him he says, “Bless
							Him of whose food we have eaten” If there are ten, he says, “Let us
							bless our God of whose food we have eaten.” If there are ten and he
							says, “Bless.” It is the same whether there are ten or ten myriads (ten
							ten thousands). If there are a hundred he says, “Let us bless the Lord
							our God of whose food we have eaten. If there are a hundred and him he
							says, “Bless.” If there are a thousand he says “Let us bless the Lord
							our God, the God of Israel of whose food we have eaten.” If there are a
							thousand and him he says “Bless.” If there are ten thousand he says,
							“Let us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts,
							who dwells among the cherubim, for the food which we have eaten.” If
							there are ten thousand and him he says, “Bless.” Corresponding to his
							blessing the others answer after him, “Blessed be the Lord our God the
							God of Israel, the God of hosts, who dwells among the cherubim, for the
							food which we have eaten.” Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: According to
							the number of the congregation, they bless, as it says, “In assemblies
							bless God, the Lord, O you who are from the fountain of Israel.” Rabbi
							Akiba said: What do we find in the synagogue? Whether there are many or
							few the he says, “Bless the Lord your God.” Rabbi Ishmael says: “Bless
							the Lord your God who is blessed.”

							Three persons who have eaten together may not separate to recite Birkat
							Hamazon. Similarly four and similarly five. Six may separate, up until
							ten. And ten may not separate until there are twenty.

							These are the points of difference between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel
							in regard to a meal. Bet Shammai says: first he blesses over the day
							and then over the wine. Bet Hillel says: first he blesses over the wine
							and then over the day.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 8: Mishnah 2

							Bet Shammai says: they wash their hands and then they pour the cup of

							their hands.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 8: Mishnah 3

							Bet Shammai says: he wipes his hand with a towel and then places it on

							Bet Shammai says: after the meal they sweep the floor is and then they

							they sweep the floor.

							Bet Shammai says: the proper order is candle, Birkat HaMazon, spices,
							and Havdalah. But Bet Hillel says: candle, spices, Birkat HaMazon, and
							Havdalah. Bet Shammai says the blessing over the candle concludes with
							the words, “Who created the light of the fire.” But Bet Hillel says:
							“Who creates the lights of the fire.”

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 8: Mishnah 6

						-
							They do not bless over the candles or the spices of non-Jews; Or over
							the candles or the spices of the dead; Or over the candles or the
							spices of idolatry; And a blessing is not said over the light until
							they benefit from its light.

							One who has eaten and forgotten to bless Birkat Hamazon: Bet Shammai
							says: he must return to the place where he ate and bless. But Bet
							Hillel says: he should say it in the place where he remembered. Until
							when can he bless? Until sufficient time has passed for the food in his
							stomach to be digested.

							If one sees a place where miracles have been done for Israel, he says,
							“Blessed be the One who made miracles for our ancestors in this place.”
							If one sees a place from which idolatry has been uprooted, he should

							On witnessing comets, earthquakes, thunder, or windy storms one says,
							“Blessed be He whose strength and might fill the world.” On seeing
							mountains, hills, seas, rivers or deserts one says, “Blessed be He who
							made creation.” Rabbi Judah says: one who sees the Great Sea should
							say, “Blessed be He who made the Great Sea,” if he sees it at
							intervals. For rain and for good news one says, “Blessed be He that is
							good and grants good.” For bad news one says, “Blessed be the true
							judge.”

							One who has built a new house or bought new vessels says, “Blessed be
							He who has kept us alive and preserved us and brought us to this
							season.” One who blesses over the evil as he blesses over the good or
							over the good as he blesses over evil; one who cries over the past,
							behold this is a vain prayer. How so? If his wife was pregnant and he
							says, “May it be his will that my wife bear a male child,” this is a
							vain prayer. If he is coming home from a journey and he hears a cry of
							distress in the town and says, “May it be his will that this is not be
							those of my house,” this is a vain prayer.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 9: Mishnah 4

							One who enters into a large city should say two prayers, one on
							entering and one on leaving. Ben Azzai says: four two on entering and
							two on leaving, he gives thanks for the past and cries out for the
							future.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 1 - Berakhot: Perek 9: Mishnah 5

							One must bless God for the evil in the same way as one blesses for the
							good, as it says, “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your
							heart, with all your soul and with all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5).
							“With all your heart,” with your two impulses, the evil impulse as well
							as the good impulse. “With all your soul” even though he takes your
							soul life away from you. “With all your might” with all your money.
							Another explanation, “With all your might” whatever treatment he metes
							out to you. One should not show disrespect to the Eastern Gate, because
							it is in a direct line with the Holy of Holies. One should not enter
							the Temple Mount with a staff, or with shoes on, or with a wallet, or
							with dusty feet; nor should one make it a short cut, all the more
							spitting is forbidden. All the conclusions of blessings that were in
							the Temple they would say, “forever lit. as long as the world is.” When
							the sectarians perverted their ways and said that there was only one
							world, they decreed that they should say, “for ever and ever lit. from
							the end of the world to the end of the world. They also decreed that a
							person should greet his fellow in God’s name, as it says, “And behold
							Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, ‘May the Lord be with
							you.’ And they answered him, “May the Lord bless you’” (Ruth 2:. And it
							also says, “The Lord is with your, you valiant warrior” (Judges 6:12).
							And it also says, “And do not despise your mother when she grows old”
							(Proverbs 23:22). And it also says, “It is time to act on behalf of the
							Lord, for they have violated Your teaching” (Psalms 119:126). Rabbi
							Natan says: this means “They have violated your teaching It is time to
							act on behalf of the Lord.”

							These are the things that have no definite quantity: The corners of the
							field. First-fruits; The offerings brought on appearing at the Temple
							on the three pilgrimage festivals. The performance of righteous deeds;
							And the study of the torah. The following are the things for which a
							man enjoys the fruits in this world while the principal remains for him
							in the world to come: Honoring one’s father and mother; The performance
							of righteous deeds; And the making of peace between a person and his
							friend; And the study of the torah is equal to them all.

							They should not leave peah of less than one-sixtieth of the field. But
							even though they said, “there is no measure for peah,” everything
							depends upon the size of the field, the number of poor people, and the
							extent of the yield.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 1: Mishnah 3

						-
							They may give peah at either at the beginning of the reaping of the
							field or at the middle of it. Rabbi Shimon says: as long as he gives at
							the end according to the set amount. Rabbi Judah says: if he leave, one
							stalk, he can rely on this as fulfilling the law of peah; and if he did
							not, then he only gives as ownerless property.

							They said a general principle concerning peah: whatever is food, and is
							looked after, and grows from the land, and is harvested all at the same
							time, and is brought in for storage, is subject to the law of pe'ah.
							Grain and beans are in this category.

							The following divide a field for peah: a stream, a pool, a private
							road, a public road, a public path, a private path in constant use in
							summer and the rainy season, fallow land, a plowed field and a
							different seed. One who harvested for animal fodder, the plot serves
							divides, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: it does not stop
							for peah unless it is plowed.

						-
							A water channel that makes harvesting on one side impossible while
							standing on the other side, Rabbi Judah says: it divides. But all of
							the hills that can be tilled with a hoe, even though cattle cannot pass
							over it in with their equipment, is regarded as part of the field he
							gives one peah from it all.
						-

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 2: Mishnah 3
					-
						-
							All of these divide in the case of a field planted with seeds, but in
							the case of trees nothing divides except a fence. Should the branches
							intertwine on top of the fence, then it does not divide and he gives
							one peah for the whole field.

						-
							As for carob trees, they are not divided as long as they see one
							another. Rabban Gamaliel said: we had this custom in the house of my
							father. We would give separate peah from the olive trees in each
							direction and one peah for all the carob trees that saw one another.
							Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok said in his name: also for the carob trees they
							had in the whole city they only gave one peah.

							He who plants his field with one kind of seed, even though he makes up
							of it two threshing-floors, he gives only one peah for the lot. If he
							plants it of two kinds, even though he makes up of it one
							threshing-floor, he must give two peahs. One who plants his field with
							two species of wheat: If he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he
							gives only one peah; But if two threshing-floors, he gives two peahs.

							It happened that Rabbi Shimon of Mitzpah planted his field with two
							different kinds and came before Rabban Gamaliel. They both went up to
							the Chamber of Hewn Stone and asked about the law. Nahum the scribe
							said: I have a tradition from Rabbi Meyasha, who received it from Abba,
							who received it from the pairs of sage, who received it from the
							prophets, a halakhah of Moses from Sinai, that one who plants his field
							with two species of wheat, if he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he
							gives only one peah, but if two threshing-floors, he gives two peahs.

							A field harvested by gentiles, or harvested by robbers, or which ants
							have bitten the stalks at the roots, or which wind and cattle have
							broken down, is exempt from peah. If the owner harvested half of it and
							robbers harvested half, it is exempt from peah, for the obligation of
							peah is in the standing grain.

							Plots of grain between olive trees: Bet Shammai say: peah from each and

							that if the ends of the rows enter one into the other, he gives one

							One who gives his field a striped appearance and leaves behind moist
							stalks: Rabbi Akiva says: he gives peah from each and every stripe. But
							the sages say: from one stripe for the whole field. The sages agree
							with Rabbi Akiba that one who sows dill or mustard in three places must
							give peah from each place.

						-
							One who clears his field of fresh onions for the market and leaves the
							dry ones in the ground for the time of the threshing floor, must give
							peah from these on their own and these on their own. The same applies
							to beans and to a vineyard. If he, however, he only thins it out, then
							he gives peah from the remainder according to the quantity of that
							which he left. But if he clears three from one place at one time, he
							gives from the remainder according to the entire quantity.

							Onions grown for their seed are liable for peah. But Rabbi Yose exempts
							them. Plots of onions growing between vegetables: Rabbi Yose says: peah
							must be given from each plot. But the sages say: from one plot for all.

							Two brothers who divided an inheritance must give two peahs. If they
							afterwards again become partners they give one peah. Two who purchase a
							tree, they give one peah. If one buys the northern section of the tree
							and the other the southern section, each must give peah separately. One
							who sells young saplings in his field, the one who purchases must give
							peah from each sapling. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When the
							owner of the field left nothing for himself. But if he did leave
							something for himself, he gives one peah for the whole.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 3: Mishnah 6

							Rabbi Eliezer says: a piece of ground large enough to plant one fourth
							of a kav is liable for peah. Rabbi Joshua says: it must be large enough
							to grow two seahs. Rabbi Tarfon says: it must be six by six
							handbreadths. R. Judah ben Batera says: it must be large enough for a
							sickle to cut at least two handfuls and the halakhah is according to
							his words. Rabbi Akiva says: any size of land is liable for peah and
							for first-fruits, and is sufficient for the writing of the prozbul, and
							also to acquire through it movable property by money, by deed, or by a
							claim based on undisturbed possession.

							One who is about to die who assigns his property in writing to another:
							If he retains any land for himself however small, he renders his gift
							valid. But if he retains no land whatsoever, his gift is not valid. One
							who assigns in writing his property to his children, and he assigns to
							his wife in writing any plot of land, however small, she lost her
							ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: if she accepted such an assignment even
							though he did not assign it to her in writing she lost her ketubah.

							Peah is given from the crop while it is still connected with the soil.
							But in the case of hanging vine-branches and the date-palm, the owner
							brings down the fruit and distributes it among the poor. Rabbi Shimon
							says: the same applies to smooth nut trees. Even if ninety-nine of the
							poor say to the owner to distribute it and one says to leave it in the
							field, this latter is listened to, since he spoke in accordance with
							the halakhah.
						-

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 2

							With hanging vine-branches and date-palm trees it is not so; even if
							ninety-nine of the poor say to the owner to leave it in the field and
							one says to distribute it, this latter is listened to, since he spoke
							in accordance with the halakhah.

							If a poor man took some of the peah already collected and threw it onto
							the remainder not yet collected, he gets none of it. If he fell down
							upon it, or spread his cloak over it, they take the peah away from him.
							The same applies to gleanings and the forgotten sheaf.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 4

							The poor may not harvest peah with scythes or tear it out of the ground
							with spades, so that they might not strike one another with these
							implements.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 5
					-
						-
							There are three times a day the poor make a search in the field for
							peah: morning, noon, and sunset. Rabban Gamaliel says: these times were
							only set lest they reduce them. Rabbi Akiva says: these were set lest
							they add to them. The men of Bet Namer used to have the poor harvest
							the peah with the aid of a rope, and they left peah at the end of each
							furrow.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 6
					-
						-
							A non-Jew who harvested his field and then converted, he is exempt from
							leaving gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah. Rabbi Judah makes him
							liable to leave the forgotten sheaf, since he becomes liable for the
							forgotten sheaf at the time of their binding.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 7
					-
						-
							One who dedicated standing grain to the Temple and then redeemed it
							while it was still standing grain, he is liable to give the
							agricultural gifts to the poor. If he dedicated sheaves and redeemed
							them while they were still sheaves, he is liable. If he dedicated
							standing grain and redeemed it when it was already in sheaves, he is
							exempt, since at the time when it became liable it was exempt.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 8
					-
						-
							Similarly one who dedicates his produce prior to the stage when they
							are subject to tithes and then redeemed them, they are liable to be
							tithed. If he dedicated them when they had already become subject to
							tithes and then redeemed them, they are liable to be tithed. If he
							dedicated them before they had ripened, and they became ripe while in
							the possession of the Temple treasurer, and he then redeemed them, they
							are exempt, since at the time when they would have been liable, they
							were exempt.

						-
							One who collected peah and said, “This is for so-and-so a poor man:”
							Rabbi Eliezer says: he has thus acquired it for him. The sages say: he
							must give it to the first poor man he finds. Gleanings, the forgotten
							sheaf and the peah of non-Jews are subject to tithes, unless he the
							non-Jew had declared them ownerless.
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 4: Mishnah 10

						-
							What are gleanings? That which falls down at the time of harvesting. If
							while he was harvesting, he harvested a handful, or plucked a fistful,
							and then a thorn pricked him, and what he had in his hand fell to the
							ground, it still belongs to the owner. That which drops from inside the
							hand or the sickle belongs to the poor, but that which falls from the
							back of the hand or the sickle belongs to the owner. That which falls
							from the top of the hand or sickle: Rabbi Ishmael says: to the poor;
							But Rabbi Akiva says: to the owner.

							If a pile of grain was stacked on part of a field from which gleanings
							had not yet been collected, whatever touches the ground belongs to the
							poor. If the wind scattered the sheaves, they estimate the amount of
							gleanings the field would have yielded and they give that to the poor.
							Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he must give to the poor the amount
							that would fall.

					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 5: Mishnah 2
					-
						-
							The top of a single ear of grain that remained after the harvesting and
							its top touches the standing stalk: If it can be cut with the stalk, it
							belongs to the owner; But if not, it belongs to the poor. If an ear of
							grain of gleanings that became mixed up with a stack of grain, the
							owner must tithe one ear of grain and give it to him the poor. Rabbi
							Eliezer says: how can this poor man give in exchange something that had
							not yet become his? Rather, the owner must transfer to the poor man the
							ownership of the whole stack and then tithe one ear of grain and give
							it to him.

							They should not irrigate a field with a water wheel, the words of Rabbi

						-
							A property owner who was passing from place to place and need to take
							gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man’s tithe, he may
							take them, and when he returns home, he must pay for the amount
							gathere, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say: he was a poor man
							at that time and so he need not make restitution.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 5: Mishnah 5

						-
							One who exchanges with the poor, what they give in exchange for his is
							exempt from tithes but what he gives in exchange for that of the poor
							is subject to tithes. Two who received a field as sharecroppers, this
							one may give to the other his share of the poor man’s tithe and this
							one may give to the other his share of the poor man’s tithe. One who
							receives a field in order to harvest it, he is forbidden to take
							gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man’s tithe. Rabbi
							Judah said: When is this so? When he receives it in order to pay the
							owner a half, third or quarter of the crop. But if the owner had said
							to him: “A third of that which you harvest belongs to you,” then he may
							take gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah, but not the poor man’s
							tithe.

							One who sells, the seller is permitted to take the agricultural gifts
							and the purchaser is forbidden. One may not hire a worker on the
							condition that the son of the worker should gather the gleanings after
							him. One who does not allow the poor to gather, or one who allows one
							but not another, or one who helps one of them to gather behold he is a
							robber of the poor. Concerning him it is said: “Do not remove the
							landmark of those that come up (olim)” (Proverbs 22:28).

							A sheaf which the workers forgot but not the land owner, or which the
							land owner forgot but not the workers; or a sheaf which the poor stood
							in front of and blocked its view, or they covered it up with stubble,

							Bet Shammai says: That which is made ownerless only in regard to the
							poor is indeed ownerless. But Bet Hillel says: it is not ownerless
							unless ownership is renounced even for the rich, as in the case of the
							sabbatical year. If all of the sheaves in a field are a kav each, and
							one is four kavs and that one is forgotten: Bet Shammai says: it is not
							considered forgotten. But Bet Hillel says: it is considered forgotten.

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 6: Mishnah 2

							A sheaf left near a stone fence, or near a stack of grain or near oxen,
							or near equipment: Bet Shammai says: it is not considered “forgotten”;
							Bet Hillel says: it is considered “forgotten.”

					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 6: Mishnah 3
					-
						-
							With regard to sheaves forgotten at the end of the row, the sheaf lying
							across from it proves that the first sheaf has not been forgotten. As
							for a sheaf that the owner took to bring it to the city and forgot it,
							all agree that it is not considered a “forgotten sheaf.”
						-
					-
						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 6: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							These are to be considered ends of the rows:If two men begin to gather
							from the middle of the row, one facing north and the other south and
							they forget some sheaves in front of them and behind them, those left
							in front of them are “forgotten,” but those left behind them are not
							“forgotten.” If an individual begins from the end of the row and he
							forgets some sheaves in front of him and behind him, those in front of
							him are not “forgotten”, whereas those behind him are “forgotten,” for
							this comes under the category of “you shall not go back to retrieve
							it.” This is the general rule: anything that can be said to fall under
							the law “you shall not go back” is considered “forgotten,” but that to
							which the principle of “you shall not go back” cannot be applied is not
							considered “forgotten.”

							Two sheaves left lying together are “forgotten,” but three are not
							“forgotten.” Two bundles of olives or carobs are “forgotten” but three
							are not “forgotten.” Two flax-stalks are “forgotten”, but three are not
							“forgotten”. Two grapes are considered “grape gleanings,” but three are
							not “grape gleanings.” Two ears of grain are deemed “gleanings,” but
							three are not gleanings.” All these rulings are according to Bet
							Hillel. And concerning them all Bet Shammai says that three that are
							left belong to the poor, and four belong to the owner.

							A sheaf that has two seahs and he forgot it it is not considered
							“forgotten.” Two sheaves that together comprise two seahs: Rabban
							Gamaliel says: they belong to the owner; But the sages say: they belong
							to the poor. Rabban Gamaliel said: “Are the rights of the owner
							strengthened or weakened according to the greater number of the
							sheaves? ” They replied, “His rights are strengthened.” He said to
							them: “If in a case of one sheaf of two seahs it is not deemed
							“forgotten,” then how much more should be the case of two sheaves that
							together contain two seahs? ” They replied: “No. If you argue in the
							case of one sheaf it is because it is large enough to be considered a
							stack. Are you going to argue likewise in the case of two sheaves which
							are like bundles? ”

						Seder 1 - Zeraim: Masekhet 2 - Peah: Perek 6: Mishnah 7

							A standing stalk of grain that contains two seahs and he forgot it, it

							A standing stalk of grain can save a sheaf and another standing stalk
							from being regarded as “forgotten”. A sheaf cannot save either another

							a single stalk.

							A seah of plucked grain and a seah of unplucked grain, and also trees;

							An olive tree that has a name in the field, such as the olive tree of
							Netofah in its time, and he forgot it, it is not deemed “forgotten.” To
							what does this apply? Only to a tree distinguished by its name,
							produce, or position. “By its name:” if it were a shifkhoni or beshani.
							“By its produce:” if it yields large quantities. “By its position:” if
							it stands at the side of the winepress or near the gap in the fence.
							Other kinds of olive trees: two are deemed “forgotten”, but three are
							not deemed “forgotten.” Rabbi Yose says: there is no law of “forgotten”
							for olive trees.

							An olive tree found standing between three rows of olive trees which
							have two plots separating them, and he forgot it, it is deemed,
							“forgotten.” An olive tree containing two seahs and he forgot it, it is
							not deemed forgotten. To what does this apply? Only when he the owner
							had not yet begun to harvest the tree, but if he had begun, even if it
							were like the olive tree of Netofah in its time, and he forgot it, it
							is deemed forgotten. As long as the owner has some of the olives
							belonging to him at the foot of the tree, he has possession of those on
							top of the tree. Rabbi Meir says: forgotten applies only after those
							with the beating-rod have gone.

							What is peret? Grapes which fall down during the harvesting. If while
							he was harvesting the grapes, he cut off an entire cluster by its
							stalk, and it got tangled up in the grape leaves, and then it fell from
							his hand to the ground and the single berries were separated, it
							belongs to the owner. One who places a basket under the vine when he is
							harvesting the grapes, behold he is a robber of the poor. Concerning
							him it is said: “Do not remove the landmark of those that come up
							(olim)” (Proverbs 22:28).

							What constitutes a defective cluster (olelet) of grapes? Any cluster
							which has neither a shoulder a wide upper part nor a pendant a
							cone-shaped lower part. If it has a shoulder or a pendant, it belongs
							to the owner. If there is a doubt, it belongs to the poor. A defective
							cluster on the joint of a vine where a normal cluster hangs from the
							vine, if it can be cut off with the cluster, it belongs to the owner;
							but if it can not, it belongs to the poor. A single grape: Rabbi Judah
							says: It is deemed a whole cluster, But the sages say: It is deemed a
							defective cluster.

							One who is thinning out vines, just as he may thin out in that which
							belongs to him, so too he may thin out in that which belongs to the

							The grapes of a vineyard in its fourth year:Bet Shammai says: the laws

							A vineyard which consists entirely of defective clusters: Rabbi Eliezer
							says: it belongs to the owner. Rabbi Akiva says: to the poor. Rabbi
							Eliezer: “When you harvest the grapes of your vineyard, do not take the
							defective clusters” (Deuteronomy 24:21). If there is no grape
							harvesting, how can there be “defective clusters”? Rabbi Akiva said to
							him: “And from your vineyard do not take the defective clusters”
							(Leviticus 19:10) even if it consists entirely of defective clusters.
							If that is so, why is it said: “When you harvest the grapes of your
							vineyard, do not take the defective clusters”? This teaches that the
							poor have no right to claim the defective clusters before the harvest.

							What is an aris (an espalier) which is regarded as a vineyard? One who
							has planted a single row consisting of five vines beside a fence ten
							handbreadths high, or beside a trench ten handbreadths deep and four
							wide, they leave a space of four cubits in which to work it. Bet
							Shammai says: they measure the four cubits from the body of the vine to
							the field; But Bet Hillel says: from the fence to the field. Rabbi
							Yohanan ben Nuri said: all who say so are mistaken! Rather, if there
							are four cubits from the body of the vines to the fence, they leave a
							space in which to work it and they may sow the rest. And how much is
							the space in which work to work a vine? Six handbreadths in every
							direction. Rabbi Akiva says: three.

							An aris which projects from a terrace: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if

							aris prohibits sowing seed in four cubits of the field, but if he is
							not able to do so, it prohibits sowing seed only in the soil which is
							directly below it. Rabbi Eliezer says: even one who has planted one row
							of vines on the ground, and one on a terrace, then if it is ten
							handbreadths above the level ground, one does not combine with the
							other; if it is not ten handbreadths high then one does combine with

							remained on one side and five vines on the other side. Then if the gap

							for every two bet se'ahs. He then uproots three sides, and leaves the
							middle side. It turns out that he has made a pen of four seahs. Rabban
							Shimon ben Gamaliel says: one of eight seahs. If his entire field is
							only four seahs in area, he must allow a portion of it to remain
							unenclosed for appearance's sake. And he may take the dung out from the
							enclosure, and spread across his field in the manner of those who
							fertilize their fields.

							They said an important general principle with regard to the sabbatical

							the law of removal applies both to it and to its money substitute.

							is the species of dyeing matter? Puah (madder) and reseda. The law of
							the sabbatical year applies both to them and to their money substitute
							but the law of removal does not apply to them or to their money
							substitute. Rabbi Meir says: their money substitutes must be removed by

							The sabbatical year cancels a debt written in a document or one not

							A loan secured by a prozbul is not cancelled. This was one of the
							things enacted by Hillel the elder; for when he observed people
							refraining from lending to one another, and thus transgressing what is
							written in the Torah, “Beware, lest you harbor the base thought, ‘The
							seventh year, the year of remission, is approaching,’ so that you are
							mean to your needy kinsman and give him nothing.” Hillel enacted the

							A pre-dated prozbul is valid, but a post-dated one, is invalid.

							A prozbul is written only for a debt secured by land. But if the debtor

							One who returns a debt after the seventh year, the creditor must say to
							the debtor: “I remit it.” But the debtor should say: “Even so I will
							repay it.” The creditor may then accept it from him, because it says:
							“And this is the word of the release” (Deuteronomy 15:2). Similarly,
							when an accidental killer has been exile to a city of refuge, and the
							citizens want to honor him, he must say to them: “I am a murderer.” If
							they say: “Even so, we want to honor you, then he may accept the honor
							from them, because it says: “And this is the word of the murderer”

							brought up, so too unclean terumah can be brought up. Bet Shammai
							answered them: No! If hullin which is treated more leniently in that it
							is permitted to non-priests allows us to bring up clean terumah that
							falls into it, does terumah which is more stringent in that it is
							forbidden to non-priests also allow us to bring up that which is
							unclean? After Bet Shammai had agreed with Bet Hillel, Rabbi Eliezer

							One who eats terumah unwittingly must repay its value plus a fifth,
							whether he eats it or drinks it, or anoints himself with it, or whether
							the terumah is clean or unclean. If he eats the added fifth he must pay
							its fifth, and a fifth of that fifth. He may not repay with terumah,
							but rather with tithed hullin, which becomes terumah. And whatever may
							be repaid in its place also becomes terumah and if the priest wishes to
							forego the fine, he cannot do so.

							A daughter of an Israelite ate terumah and afterwards married a

							priest she can repay to herself the value and the fifth. But if a
							priest had already acquired the terumah she had eaten, she must repay
							the value to the owners, but she can repay the fifth to herself,
							because they said that he who eats terumah unwittingly, pays the value
							to the owners and the fifth to whoever he wants.

							If one stole terumah but did not eat it, he must return double-payment

							the other principal at the price of terumah. If one stole terumah of
							dedicated property and ate it, he must repay two fifths and the

							released from levirate marriage): Rabbi Eliezer says: they must repay
							both the value and the fifth. But Rabbi Joshua exempts them from the

							it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah:

							Concerning both cases Rabbi Joshua said: This is not the kind of

							And it is subject to gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah. Poor

							of threashing with an animal is to be praised. But he who threshes it

							is looked after, and grows from the land, is liable for tithes. And
							they have further stated another general principle concerning tithes:
							whatever is considered food both at the beginning and at the conclusion
							of its growth even though he holds on to it in order to increase the
							quantity of food, is liable to tithe whether it is harvested in its
							earlier or later stages. But whatever is not considered food in the
							earlier stages of its growth but only in its later stages, is not
							liable to tithe until it can be considered food.

							What is considered a “threshing floor” for tithes i.e. when does
							produce become liable for tithes? Cucumbers and gourds are liable for
							tithes once he removes their fuzz. And if he doesn’t remove it, once he
							makes a pile. Melons once he removes the fuzz with hot water. And if
							they he does not remove the fuzz, once he stores them in the muktzeh.
							Vegetables which are tied in bundles, from the time he ties them up in
							bundles. If he does not tie them up in bundles, until he fills the
							vessel with them. And if he does not fill the vessel, after he has
							gathered all that he wishes to gather. Produce which is packed in a
							basket is liable for tithes after he has covered it. If he is not going
							to cover it, until he fills the vessel with them. And if he does not
							fill the vessel, after he has gathered all that he wishes to gather.
							When does this apply? When one brings the produce to the market. But
							when he brings it to his own house, he may make a chance meal of it,
							until he reaches his house.

							oil with second tithe money. But one may spice wine. If honey or spices
							fell into wine and improved its value, the improved value is divided
							according to the proportion. If fish was cooked with leek of second
							tithe and it improved in value, the improved value is divided according
							to the proportion. If dough of second tithe was baked and it improved
							in value, the whole improved value is second tithe. This is the general

							Hullin coins and second tithe coins which were scattered together:

							One who sets aside an issar for the redemption of maaser sheni and on

							the value of half a pundion of maaser sheni and then went to another
							place where the pundion was worth an issar, he may eat maaser sheni the
							value of another half an issar. One who sets aside an issar of maaser
							sheni money he should eat on its account eleven parts of the value of
							an issar, or he should eat an additional one hundredth of an issar. Bet
							Shammai say: in both cases one tenth part of an issar. But Bet Hillels

							people would write a tav for terumah. Rabbi Yose says: they may all
							stand for the names of people. Rabbi Yose said: even if he finds a jar

							another grafted shoot, even if he rooted them in the soil, they are
							permitted. Rabbi Meir said: in an instance where it is strongly
							grafted, it is permitted, but in an instance where it is poorly

							There are some who bring bikkurim and recite the declaration; others

							must not be sold as a Hebrew slave, unlike men or women. He cannot be
							evaluated, unlike men or women. If one says: “I will be a nazirite, if

							A great principle they stated in respect to Shabbat: anyone who forgets
							the fundamental law of Shabbat and performs many labors on many
							Shabbatot, is liable for only one sin-offering. One who knows the
							fundamental law of Shabbat and performs many labors on many Shabbatot
							is liable for a sin-offering for each and every Shabbat. One who knows
							that it is Shabbat and performs many labors on many Shabbatot, is
							liable for every primary labor. One who performs many labors belonging
							to the same category is obligated for only one sin-offering.

							the making of two loops, weaving two threads, dividing two threads,
							tying and untying, sewing two stitches, tearing in order to sew two

							They also stated another general principle: whatever is fit to store

							and one carries it out on Shabbat, only he that stores it is liable.

							If one carries out a loaf into the public domain, he is liable. If two
							carry it out, both are exempt. If one could not carry it out and two
							carry it out, they are liable; But Rabbi Shimon exempts them. If one
							carries out less than the standard quantity of food in a utensil, he is
							not liable for the utensil, because the utensil is secondary to the
							food. If one carries out a living person on a bed, he is not liable
							even in respect of the bed, because the bed is secondary to him. A
							corpse in a bed, he is liable. And similarly if one carries out the
							size of an olive of a corpse, the size of an olive of a nevelah, or the
							size of a lentil of a dead creeping thing, he is liable. But Rabbi
							Shimon exempts him.

							Symmachus says: with unconsecrated produce only. An eruv may be

							had been uprooted and then inserted in the ground, even though it was a

							Rabbi Eliezer says: if a festival day immediately precedes or follows

							the first day, and for the second day I will be as the people of my
							town”; or “my eruv is for the second day, and for the first day I will
							be as the people of my town”. But the sages say: he either prepares an
							eruv for one direction or none at all; he either prepares one eruv for
							the two days or none at all. How should he act? He brings the eruv on
							the first day, he lets it get dark and then he takes it and goes away.
							On the second day he again carries the eruv to the same place and lets
							it grow dark and then he may eat it. He thus benefits both in his going
							and in eating his eruv. If the eruv was eaten up on the first day it
							remains effective for the first day but not for the second. Rabbi
							Eliezer said to them: you do then agree with me that they are two

							They measure the Shabbat limit only with a rope fifty cubits long,

							reached a hill he spans it and resumes his measuring, provided he does

							observed. Even a slave and even a female slave are believed when they

							If a dead creeping thing was found in the Temple, a priest should carry
							it out in his girdle in order not to keep the impurity there any longer
							than is necessary, the words of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Judah
							says: it should be removed with wooden tongs in order that uncleanness
							shall not increase. From where must it be removed? From the sanctuary,
							from the hall, and from between the hall and the altar, the words of
							Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas. Rabbi Akiva says: from any place where karet is
							incurred for entering intentionally and a sin-offering for entering in
							error from there it must be removed, and from any other place they
							cover it with a large pot. Rabbi Shimon says: wherever the sages have
							permitted you anything they have only given you what is really yours,
							since they have only permitted you that which is forbidden as shevut.

							On the evening of the fourteenth of Nissan they search they house for

							brought does not require searching, So why did they rule: two rows of
							the wine cellar must be searched? This is actually a place into which
							chametz might be taken. Bet Shammai say: two rows over the front of the

							doors of the Temple court. They sounded a teki'ah, a teru'ah, and a
							teki'ah. The priests stood in rows, and in their hands were basins of
							silver and basins of gold, a row which was entirely of silver was of
							silver, and a row which was entirely of gold was of gold, they were not

							Rabbi Eliezer said: is it not logical: if slaughtering, which is
							usually forbidden as a labor, overrides Shabbat, shouldn’t these, which
							are only forbidden as mandated rest (shevut), override Shabbat? Rabbi
							Joshua said to him: let the festival prove this, for they permitted
							labor on the festival and forbade activities forbidden because of
							shevut. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: what is this, Joshua? What proof is
							a voluntary act in respect of a commandment! Rabbi Akiva answered and
							said: let sprinkling purificatory waters prove it, which is performed
							because it is a commandment and is forbidden only as a shevut, yet it
							does not override Shabbat; so you too, do not wonder at these, that
							though they are required on account of a commandment and are forbidden
							only as shevut, yet they do not override Shabbat. Rabbi Eliezer said to
							him: but in respect of that I am arguing: if slaughtering, which is a
							labor, overrides Shabbat, is it not logical that sprinkling, which is
							only a shevut, should override Shabbat! Rabbi Akiva said to him: or the
							opposite: if sprinkling, which is forbidden as a shevut, does not
							override Shabbat, then slaughtering, which is normally forbidden on
							account of labor, is it not logical that it should not override
							Shabbat. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva! You are uprooting what is
							written in the Torah, “at twilight, offer it at its set time” (Numbers
							9:3), both on week-days and on Shabbat. He said to him: master, give me
							an appointed time for these as there is an appointed season for
							slaughtering! Rabbi Akiva stated a general rule: work which could be
							done on the eve of Shabbat does not override Shabbat; slaughtering,
							which could not be done on the eve of Shabbat, does override Shabbat.

							If the pesah was slaughtered for a different purpose on Shabbat, he the

							him liable to a sin-offering, But Rabbi Joshua exempts him. Rabbi
							Eliezer said to him: if for the pesah, which it is permitted to
							slaughter for its own purpose, yet when he changes its purpose he is
							liable; then other sacrifices, which are forbidden to slaughter even
							for their own purpose, if he changes their purpose is it not logical
							that he should be liable. Rabbi Joshua said to him: not so. If you say
							with regard to the pesah, he is liable because he changed it to
							something that is forbidden; will you say the same of other sacrifices,
							where he changed them for something that is permitted? Rabbi Eliezer
							said to him: let the community sacrifices prove it, which are permitted
							for their own sake, yet he who slaughters other sacrifices in their
							name is liable. Rabbi Joshua said him: not so. If you say with regard
							to the public sacrifices, that is because they have a limit; will you
							say the same of the pesah, which has no limit? Rabbi Meir says: he too
							who slaughters other sacrifices in the name of public sacrifice is not

							A pesah whose blood has been sprinkled and then it became known that it

							the frontlet propitiates for the uncleanness of the blood, but the
							frontlet does not propitiate for the uncleanness of the body of the

							Rabban Gamaliel used to say: whoever does not make mention of these

							the pesah, matzah, and bitter herbs. The pesah because the Omnipresent
							passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt. The matzah because our
							fathers were redeemed from Egypt. The bitter herb because the Egyptians
							embittered the lives of our fathers in Egypt. In every generation a man
							is obligated to regard himself as though he personally had gone forth
							from Egypt, because it is said, “And you shall tell your son on that
							day, saying: ‘It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I
							came forth out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:8). Therefore it is our duty to
							thank, praise, laud, glorify, raise up, beautify, bless, extol, and
							adore Him who made all these miracles for our fathers and ourselves; He
							brought us forth from slavery into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from
							mourning into festivity, from darkness into great light, and from
							servitude into redemption. Let us say before him, Hallelujah!

							into a fountain of waters” (Psalms 114:8). And he concludes with a
							formula of redemption. Rabbi Tarfon says: “Who redeemed us and redeemed
							our fathers from Egypt”, but he did not conclude with a blessing. Rabbi
							Akiva says: “So may the Lord our God and the God of our fathers bring
							us to other appointed times and festivals which come towards us for

							bird-offerings of zavot or bird-offerings of women after childbirth, Or
							sin-offerings or guilt-offerings. But vow-offerings and

							all offerings which can be made as a vow-offering or a

							be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering they do not accept

							At three periods of the year the appropriation is made from the shekels
							in the chamber: Half a month before Pesah, half a month before Shavuot,
							and half a month before Sukkot, and these are also the threshing floors
							the seasons for the tithe of beasts, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben
							Azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of Adar, and on the first of Sivan, and
							on the twenty-ninth of Av. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the
							first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan, and on the twenty-ninth of Elul.
							Why did they say, “On the twenty-ninth of Elul and not on the first of
							Tishre? Because the first of Tishre is a holy day, and it is not
							permitted to tithe on a festival, therefore they moved it up to the
							twenty-ninth of Elul.

							the chamber wearing either a bordered cloak or shoes or sandals or
							tefillin or an amulet, lest if he became poor people might say that he
							became poor because of a sin committed in the chamber, or if he became
							rich people might say that he became rich from the appropriation in the

							Because through it Jechoniah went out into his captivity. In the east
							was the Nicanor’s Gate, and it had two small gates, one to the right
							and one to the left. There were also two gates in the west which had no

							It was also a condition laid down by the court in the case of a high

							Originally anyone who wished to remove the ashes from the altar did so.
							When they were many, they would run up the ramp of the altar and he

							When the court saw that they incurred danger, they decreed that they

							the two flanks, the innards, the fine flour, the cakes and the wine.

							And why was all that necessary? Because once the light of the moon rose

							offering, and afterwards they had to take it out to the place of
							burning. They led the high priest down to the place of immersion. This
							was the rule in the Temple: whoever covers his feet required an

							If the lot “For the Name” came up in his right hand, the deputy high

							if the lot “For the Name” came up in his left hand, the head of the

							He killed it the bull and received its blood in a bowl, and he gave it

							On other days he would take out the cinders with a silver coal-pan, and

							would take them up with a coal-pan containing four kabs, and empty it
							into one containing three kabs, but this day he took them out with one
							containing three kabs, and in it he brought them in. Rabbi Yose says:

							them out with one containing three kabs, and in it he brought them in.
							On other days the pan was heavy, today it was light. On other days its

							gold, today of reddish gold, the words of Rabbi Menahem. On other days
							he would offer half a mina in the morning and half a mina in the

							They brought out to him the ladle and the pan and he took two hands
							full of incense and put it into the ladle, a large high priest
							according to his size, a small one according to his size and thus was
							its measure. He took the pan in his right hand and the ladle in his
							left hand. He walked through the Hechal until he came to the place
							between the two curtains which separated the Holy from the Holy of
							Holies; between them was a space of one cubit. Rabbi Yose says: there
							was but one curtain, as it is said: “And the curtain shall serve you as
							a partition between the Holy and the Holy of Holies” (Exodus 26:33).
							The outer curtain was looped on the south side and the inner curtain on
							the north side. He walked along between them until he reached the north
							side. When he reached the north side he turned round to the south and
							went on along the curtain, to his left, until he reached the Ark. When
							he reached the Ark he put the pan of burning coals between the two
							poles. He heaped up the incense upon the coals and the whole house
							became full with smoke. He came out by the way he entered and in the
							outer house he uttered a short prayer. He did not make the prayer long
							so as not to frighten Israel.

							either upwards or downwards but rather like one who cracks a whip. And
							thus would he count: one, one and one, one and two, one and three, one

							out and place it on the second golden stand in the Hekhal. Rabbi Judah
							said: there was only one golden stand there. He would take the blood of
							the bull and put down the blood of the goat, and sprinkle from it upon
							the curtains facing the Ark outside, once upwards, seven times
							downward, aiming to sprinkle neither upwards nor downwards, and he
							wouldn’t intend to sprinkle either upwards or downwards but rather like
							one who cracks a whip. Thus would he count as above. Then he would take
							the blood of the goat, and put down the blood of the bull, and sprinkle
							from it upon the curtain facing the ark outside once upwards, seven
							times downwards as above. Then he would pour the blood of the bull into
							the blood of the goat emptying the full vessel into the empty one.

							“And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord” (Leviticus

							sprinkling in downward motion. From where does he begin? From the
							northeast horn of the altar, then the northwest, then the southwest,
							then the southeast. From the place where he begins sprinkling when
							offering a sin-offering on the outer altar, there he completes
							sprinkling on the inner altar. Rabbi Eliezer says: he remained in his
							place and sprinkled. And on every horn he would sprinkle from below
							upwards, with the exception of the horn at which he was standing, which
							he would sprinkle from above downwards.

							And the remainder of the blood sprinkled on the outer altar he poured

							The two goats of Yom Hakkippurim: it is a requirement that they be

							same time. But if they are not alike they are still valid. If he bought
							one today and the other tomorrow, they are valid. If one of them died
							before the lot was cast another one is bought for the second one. But
							if one of them died after the lot was cast another pair must be bought
							and he must cast lots for them over again. If the one that ‘For Hashem’
							died, he the high priest should say: “This one upon which the lot ‘For
							Hashem’ has fallen stands in its stead.” And if the one that was ‘For
							Azazel’ died he should say: “This one upon which the lot ‘For Azazel’
							has fallen stands in its stead.” The other one is left to pasture until
							it becomes blemished and it is to be sold and its value goes to the
							chest for voluntary offerings, for the sin-offering of the congregation
							is not be left to die. Rabbi Judah says: it is left to die. Furthermore
							Rabbi Judah said: if the blood was poured away, the goat which is to be
							sent away is left to die. If the goat to be sent away died the blood is
							poured.

							Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which your

							bosom and say, “More than what I have read out before you is written
							here.” And “On the tenth …” (Numbers 29:7-11) which is in the Book of
							Numbers he recites by heart. And he recites on it eight benedictions:
							“For the law”, “For the Temple service,” “For thanksgiving,” “For the

							The sin-offering and the certain guilt-offering effect atonement. Death
							and Yom HaKippurim effect atonement together with repentance.
							Repentance effects atonement for light transgressions: the
							transgression of positive commandments and negative commandments. And
							for severer transgressions repentance suspends the divine punishment,
							until Yom HaKippurim arrives and effects atonement.

							One who says: I shall sin and repent, sin and repent, they do not
							afford him the opportunity to repent. If one says: I shall sin and Yom
							HaKippurim will atone for me, Yom HaKippurim does not effect atonement.
							For transgressions between man and God Yom HaKippurim effects
							atonement, but for transgressions between man and his fellow Yom
							HaKippurim does not effect atonement, until he has pacified his fellow.
							This was expounded by Rabbi Elazar b. Azariah: “From all your sins
							before the Lord you shall be clean” (Leviticus 16:30) for
							transgressions between man and God Yom HaKippurim effects atonement,
							but for transgressions between man and his fellow Yom HaKippurim does
							not effect atonement, until he has pacified his fellow.. Rabbi Akiva
							said: Happy are you, Israel! Who is it before whom you become pure? And
							who is it that purifies you? Your Father who is in heaven, as it is
							said: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean”
							(Ezekiel 36:25). And it further says: “O hope (mikveh) of Israel, O
							Lord” (Jeremiah 17:1--just as a mikveh purifies the unclean, so too
							does he Holy One, blessed be He, purify Israel.

							A sukkah which is more than twenty cubits high is not valid. Rabbi

							They may not bind the lulav except with strands of its own species, the

							deliver us” (118:25), the words of Bet Hillel. Bet Shammai say: also at
							“O Lord, let us prosper.” Rabbi Akiva says: I was watching Rabban
							Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua, and while all the people were waving their
							lulavs at “O Lord, let us prosper” they waved them only at “O Lord
							deliver us.” One who was on a journey and had no lulav to take, when he
							enters his house he should take it even if he is at his table. If he
							did not take the lulav in the morning, he should take it at any time
							before dusk, since the whole day is valid for taking the lulav.

							In a place where the custom is to repeat verses, he should repeat;
							Where the custom is to say them only once, he should say them once.
							Where the custom is to recite a blessing afterwards, he should recite
							the blessing afterwards. Everything is dependent on local custom. One
							who purchases a lulav from his fellow in the sabbatical year, the
							latter should give him the etrog as a gift, since one is not permitted
							to purchase it in the sabbatical year.

							In earlier times the lulav was taken for seven days in the Temple, and

							on the whole of the day of waving it be forbidden to eat the new

							If the first day of the festival falls on Shabbat, all the people bring

							the first day of the festival with his friend’s lulav.” But on the

							The mitzvah of the lulav how was it carried out? If the first day of
							the festival fell on Shabbat, they brought their lulavim to the Temple
							Mount, and the attendants would receive them and arrange them on top of
							the portico, and the elders laid theirs in the chamber. And they would
							teach the people to say, “Whoever gets my lulav in his hand, let it be
							his as a gift.” The next day they got up early, and came to the Temple
							Mount and the attendants threw down their lulavim before them, and they
							snatched at them, and so they used to come to blows with one another.
							When the court saw that they reached a state of danger, they instituted
							that each man should take his lulav in his own home.

						Seder 2 - Moed: Masekhet 6 - Sukkah: Perek 4: Mishnah 5

							The mitzvah of the aravah how was it performed? There was a place below
							Jerusalem called Moza. They went down there and gathered tall branches
							of aravot and then they came and stood them up at the sides of the
							altar, and their tops were bent over the altar. They then sounded a
							teki’ah long blast, a teru’ah staccato blast and again a teki’ah. Every
							day they went round the altar once, saying, “O Lord, save us, O Lord,
							make us prosper” (Psalms 118:. Rabbi Judah says: “Ani vaho, save us.”
							On that day they went round the altar seven times. When they departed,
							what did they say? “O altar, beauty is to you! O altar, beauty is to
							you!” Rabbi Eliezer said: they would say, “To the Lord and to you, O
							altar, to the Lord and to you, O altar.”

							As was its performance on a weekday, so was its performance on Shabbat,
							except that they would gather them on the eve of Shabbat and place them
							in golden basins so that they would not become wilted. Rabbi Yohanan
							ben Beroka says: they used to bring palm branches and they would beat
							them on the ground at the sides of the altar, and that day was called
							“the day of the beating of the palm branches.”

							Immediately after beating the willows (or palm branches) the children

					-
						Seder 2 - Moed: Masekhet 6 - Sukkah: Perek 4: Mishnah 8
					-
						-
							The Hallel and rejoicing are on all eight days: How is this so? This
							teaches that one is obligated for the Hallel, for rejoicing and for
							honoring the festival on the last day, just as he is on all the other
							days of the festival. The sukkah is for seven days. How so? Once he
							finished eating his meal on the seventh day, he should not untie his
							sukkah, but he removes its contents from the time of minhah and onwards
							in honor of the last day of the festival.

							How was the water libation performed? A golden flask holding three logs
							was filled from the Shiloah. When they arrived at the water gate, they
							sounded a teki'ah long blast, a teru'ah a staccato note and again a
							teki'ah. The priest then went up the ascent of the altar and turned to
							his left where there were two silver bowls. Rabbi Judah says: they were
							of plaster but they looked silver because their surfaces were darkened
							from the wine. They had each a hole like a slender snout, one being
							wide and the other narrow so that both emptied at the same time. The
							one on the west was for water and the one on the east for wine. If he
							poured the flask of water into the bowl for wine, or that of wine into
							that for water, he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Judah says: with
							one log he performed the ceremony of the water-libation all eight days.
							To the priest who performed the libation they used to say, “Raise your
							hand”, for one time, a certain man poured out the water over his feet,
							and all the people pelted him with their etrogs.

							At the conclusion of the first festival day of Sukkot they descended to

							Men of piety and good deeds used to dance before them with lighted

							the Levites stood with their musical instruments and sang their songs.
							Two priests stood by the upper gate which leads down from the Court of
							the Israelites to the Court of the Women, with two trumpets in their

							step they sounded a teki'ah, a teru'ah and again a teki'ah. When they

							They never have less than twenty-one blasts in the Temple, and never
							more than forty-eight. Every day there were twenty-one blasts in the
							Temple, three at the opening of the gates, nine at the morning tamid
							sacrifice, and nine at the evening tamid sacrifice. At the musafim
							(additional sacrifices) they would add another nine. And on the eve of
							Shabbat they would add another six, three as a sign to the people to
							stop working and three to mark a distinction between the holy and the
							profane. On the eve of Shabbat in the intermediate days of the Sukkoth
							festival, there were therefore forty-eight blasts: three at the opening
							of the gates, three at the upper gate, three at the lower gate, three
							at the water-drawing, three at the altar, nine at the daily morning
							sacrifice, nine at the daily evening sacrifice, nine at the additional
							sacrifices, three as a sign to the people to cease from work, and three

							On the first festival day of Sukkot there were thirteen bulls, two rams

							remaining four one each. On the third day four offered two each and the
							remaining six one each. On the fourth day three offered two each and
							the remaining eight one each. On the fifth day two offered two each and
							the remaining ten one each. On the sixth day one offered two and the
							remaining twelve one each. On the seventh day all were equal. On the
							eighth day they again cast lots as on the other festivals. They said:
							the watch that offered bulls on one day should not offer them on the
							next, but that they should take their turns in rotation.

							At three periods in the year all the priestly watches shared equally in
							the festival sacrifices and in the division of the showbread. On
							Shavuot they used to say to the priest, “Here is matzah for you, here
							is chametz for you.” A watch whose period of service was fixed for that
							festival week offered the tamid, vow-offerings and freewill-offerings
							and all other public offerings; and it offered them all. A festival
							which fell next to Shabbat, either before or after it, all the watches
							shared equally in the distribution of the showbread.

							If one day intervened between them Shabbat and Yom Tov, the watch whose

							they that were detained took two. On all other days of the year the
							incoming watch took six loaves and the outgoing watch six. Rabbi Judah
							said, the incoming watch took seven and the outgoing five. The incoming
							watch divided it in the north, and the outgoing in the south. The watch
							of Bilgah always divided it in the south; their ring was fixed and
							their alcove was blocked up.

							If they don’t know him the one who came to testify, they send another

							How did they light the torches? They used to bring long poles of cedar

							There was a large courtyard in Jerusalem, and it was called Bet Yazek.
							There all the witnesses used to assemble and the court would examine
							them there. They would make large feasts for them there so that they
							would have an incentive to come. Originally they used not to leave the
							place the whole day, but Rabban Gamaliel decreed that they could go two
							thousand cubits from it in any direction. And these were not the only
							ones who could go two thousand cubits in any direction, but also a
							midwife who has come to deliver a child, or one who comes to rescue
							from a fire or from bandits or from a river in flood or from a building
							that has fallen in all these are like residents of the town, and may go

							How do they test the witnesses? The pair which arrives first, they test

							the north of it or to the south? How high was it, and in which
							direction was it inclined? And how broad was it? ” If he says he saw it
							in front of the sun, his evidence is rejected. After that they would
							bring in the second and test him. If their accounts were the same,
							their evidence was accepted. And the other pairs were only questioned
							briefly, not because they were required at all, but so that they should
							not go out disappointed, so that they would be regular in coming to
							testify.

							came and said, “We saw it in the morning in the east and in the evening
							in the west.” Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: they are lying witnesses.
							When they came to Yavneh Rabban Gamaliel accepted them. On another
							occasion two witnesses came and said, “We saw it at its proper time,
							but on the night which should have been the new moon it was not seen,”
							and Rabban Gamaliel accepted their evidence. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas

							If the court and all of Israel saw it, if the witnesses were examined
							and there was no time left to say “Sanctified” before it grew dark,
							then the month is impregnated (it has thirty days). If the court alone
							saw it, two of them should stand up and testify before them, and then
							they can say, “Sanctified, sanctified.” If three people saw it, and
							they themselves are the court, two of them should stand up and they
							should seat some of their colleagues with the one remaining judge, and
							they the two should testify before them and they can then say,
							“Sanctified, sanctified.” For an individual is not trusted to sanctify

							sacrifice. If witnesses came after the afternoon sacrifice that day
							should be kept as holy and also the next day. After the destruction of
							the temple Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that testimony with regard
							to the new moon should be received during the whole day. Rabbi Joshua
							ben Korha said: this further did Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decree, that
							not matter where the head of the court might be, the witnesses should

							“patriarchs”, “powers” and the “sanctification of the name” and
							includes the kingship verse with the sanctification of the day and

							blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah; on the contrary, they may help

							equal to three yevavot. If one prolonged the first teki'ah so that it
							went directly into the second, it counts only as one. One who has
							blessed recited the Amidah and then a shofar is given to him, he sounds
							a teki'ah teru'ah teki'ah three times. Just as the shaliah tzibbur is
							obligated, so every single individual is obligated. Rabban Gamaliel

							bring in the pesah ovens so that they do not dissolve.” He prayed and
							no rain fell. What did he do? He drew a circle and stood within it and
							exclaimed before Him: “Master of the universe, Your children have
							turned their faces to me because I am like one who was born in Your
							house. I swear by Your great name that I will not move from here until
							You have mercy upon Your children.” Rain then began to drip, and he
							exclaimed: “I did not request this but rain which can fill cisterns,
							ditches and caves. The rain then began to come down with great force,
							and he exclaimed: “I did not request this but pleasing rain of blessing
							and abudance.” Rain then fell in the normal way until the Jews in
							Jerusalem had to go up Temple Mount because of the rain. They came and
							said to him: “In the same way that you prayed for the rain to fall pray
							now for the rain to stop.” He replied: “Go and see if the stone of
							people claiming lost objects has washed away.” Rabbi Shimon ben Shetah
							sent to him: “Were you not Honi I would have excommunicated you, but
							what can I do to you, for you are spoiled before God and he does your
							will like a son that is spoiled before his father and his father does
							his request. Concerning you it is written, “Let your father and your

							What are the ma’amadot? Since it is said, “Command the children of
							Israel and say to them: My offering, My food” (Numbers 28:2). Now how
							can a man’s offering be offered and he is not present? Therefore the
							former prophets instituted twenty-four mishmarot (guards). For each
							mishmar there was a ma’amad at the Temple in Jerusalem consisting of
							priests, Levites and Israelites. When the time came for the mishmar to
							go up to Jerusalem the priests and Levites went up to Jerusalem and the
							Israelites of that mishmar assembled in their cities and read the story

							The men of the maamad fasted on four days of that week, from Monday to

							Sunday in order not to switch from the rest and delight of Shabbat to
							weariness and fasting and thereby die. On Sunday they read, “In the
							beginning,” and, “Let there be a firmament;” On Monday, “Let there be a
							firmament,” and, “Let the waters be gathered together;” On Tuesday,
							“Let the waters be gathered together,” and, “Let there be lights;” On
							Wednesday, “Let there be lights,” and, “Let the waters swarm;” On
							Thursday, “Let the waters swarm,” and, “Let the earth bring forth;” On

							On these days the daughters of Jerusalem would go out in borrowed white

							required immersion. The daughters of Jerusalem come out and dance in
							the vineyards. What would they say? Young man, lift up your eyes and
							see what you choose for yourself. Do not set your eyes on beauty but
							set your eyes on the family. “Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
							but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be praised” (Proverbs

							They do not rend their clothes or bare their shoulders, or provide a
							meal for the mourners except for the relatives of the dead. And they do
							not provide a meal except on an upright couch. They do not bring food
							to the house of mourning on an ornamental tray, platter, or flat
							basket, but in plain baskets. And they do not say the mourners’
							blessing during the festival. But they may stand in a row and comfort
							the mourners and the mourners may formally dismiss the community.
							Section one: When one heard that a close relative had died, one would
							rend whatever clothes they were wearing. Baring the shoulder was also a
							sign of mourning. The mourner was provided by the community with the
							first meal after the funeral. On Hol Hamoed only a close relative would
							perform these practices. Others would not. I should note that today
							only close relatives do these actions in any case. The circle of
							mourners was bigger in the Talmudic period. Section two: It was
							customary to overturn the bed during mourning and then sit on the bed
							as a sign of mourning. But one does not overturn the bed during Hol
							Hamoed. This practice fell into disuse sometime after the Talmudic
							period. Section three: This halakhah is true in all cases. When
							bringing food to the mourner, they should bring it in plain baskets. A
							source in the Talmud relates that originally people would use fancy
							silver and gold vessels, but poor people would be embarrassed that they
							could not afford such fancy funerals and mourning homes. As a response
							the rabbis decreed that everyone must bring in a simple vessel. The
							mourning home is not a place where one should be showing off one’s
							wealth. Section four: The mourners’ blessing was stated on return from
							burial. They would stand in a line and comfort the mourner with this
							blessing. It may have also been recited at other points as well. But it
							is a public sign of mourning and should not be done on Hol Hamoed.
							Section five: While the blessing is not recited on Hol Hamoed, burial
							is. Along with the burial, they may have the formal line of comforters
							that would accompany the mourners on their way home. The same goes true
							for the official words that the mourner seems to have said to the
							comforters, to allow them to go home without accompanying the mourner
							all the way home.

							They do not place the bier on the thruway during the festival so as not

							that are close to the bier clap their hands in grief.

							On Rosh Hodesh, on Hannukah and on Purim they may wail and clap their

							they offer a lamentation. After the dead has been buried they neither
							wail nor clap their hands in grief. What is meant by wailing? When all
							wail in unison. What is meant by a lament? When one speaks and all
							respond after her, as it is said: “And teach your daughters wailing and
							one another each lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:19). But as to the future, it
							says: “He will destroy death forever, and the Lord God will wipe away
							the tears from all faces” (Isaiah 25:9).

							Greater stringency applies to sacred things than to terumah, that they
							may immerse vessels within vessels together for terumah, but not for
							sacred things. The outside and inside and handle of a vessel are
							regarded as separate for terumah, but not for sacred things. One that
							carries anything possessing midras-uncleanness may carry at the same
							time terumah, but not sacred things. The garments of those who eat
							terumah posses midras-uncleanness for those who eat sacred things. The
							rule for the immersion of garments for those who would eat terumah is
							not the same as the rule for those who would eat sacred things: for in
							the case of sacred things, he must first untie any knots in the unclean
							garment, dry it if it is wet, then immerse it, and afterwards retie it;
							but in case of terumah, it may first be tied and afterwards immersed.

							Vessels that have been finished in purity require immersion before they
							are used for sacred things, but not before they are used for terumah. A
							vessel unites all its contents for impurity in the case of sacred
							things, but not in the case of terumah. Sacred things become invalid by
							impurity of a fourth degree, but terumah only by impurity of a third
							degree. In the case of terumah, if one hand of his hands became impure,
							the other remains clean, but in the case of sacred things, he must
							immerse both hands, because the one hand defiles the other for sacred
							things but not for terumah.

							If the season of the wine-presses and olive-presses passed, and they
							brought to him a jar of wine of terumah, he the priest should not
							accept it from him, but the am ha-aretz may leave it for the coming
							season of the wine-press. But if he said to him, “I have set apart a
							quarter log of wine as a sacred thing,” he is believed in regard to the

							A general rule has been said about the yavamah: Wherever she is

							have yibbum. If her sister is also her sister-in-law, she may perform

							A “prohibition due to a commandment” refers to the secondary incest

							refers to the following forbidden relationships: a widow to a high

							If one has any kind of brother, that brother requires his brother’s

							If a man betrothed one of two sisters and does not know which of them
							he has betrothed, he must give a get (a bill of divorce) to this one
							and a get to this one. If he died, and he had a brother, the brother
							must perform halitzah for both of them. If he had two brothers, one is
							to perform halitzah and the other may have yibbum. If they both

							If two men betrothed two sisters and one does not know whom he

							two bills of divorce and the other gives two bills of divorce. If they
							died and this one has a brother and this one has a brother, this
							brother performs halitzah for both widows and this brother performs
							halitzah for both widows. If one has one brother and the other has two
							brothers, one brother performs halitzah for both widows and as regards
							the two, one performs halitzah and the other may perform yibbum. If
							they both preempted and married they do not take the women away from
							them. If this one had two brothers and the other had two brothers, one
							brother of one performs halitzah for one widow and one brother of the
							other performs halitzah with the other widow, and then the other
							brother of the first may have yibbum with the halutzah of the second
							and the other brother of the second may have yibbum with the halutzah
							of the first. If both preempted and performed halitzah, the other two
							must not perform yibbum, rather one must perform halitzah and the other

							The commandment to perform yibbum is upon the oldest brother. If a
							younger brother preempted him by performing yibbum, he has acquired a
							wife. If a man is suspected of having relations with a slave and then
							she was freed, or with a non-Jewish woman who then converted, he must
							not marry her. If, however, he did marry her they do not take her away
							from him. If a man is suspected of having relations with a married

							even though he married her, he must divorce her.

							performed for his wife, because there was a time when he was fit to
							have children. A eunuch by nature neither performs halitzah nor is
							halitzah performed for his wife, since there never was a time when he
							was fit. Rabbi Eliezer said: Not so! Rather a eunuch by nature performs
							halitzah and halitzah is performed for his wife, because he may be
							cured. A man-made eunuch neither performs halitzah nor is halitzah
							performed for his wife, since he cannot be cured. Rabbi Joshua ben

							If she has taken anything from this one or that one, she must return

							Beth Shammai says: Only those who are betrothed may exercise the right

							be made against a husband but not against a yavam; But Beth Hillel
							says: Either against a husband or against a yavam. Beth Shammai says:
							The declaration must be made in his presence, But Beth Hillel says:
							Either in his presence or not in his presence. Beth Shammai says: The
							declaration must be made before the court, But Beth Hillel says: Either
							before the court or not before the court. Beth Hillel said to Beth
							Shammai: A girl may exercise the right of refusal while she is a minor
							even four or five times. Beth Shammai said to them: “The daughters of
							Israel are not ownerless property! Rather, either she makes a
							declaration of refusal and then waits until she is of age, or she makes
							a declaration of refusal and marries again immediately. Section one:
							According to Beth Shammai only those who are betrothed are allowed to
							make a declaration of refusal and thereby leave their husbands without
							a get. Beth Hillel says even if she was married she may do so.
							According to the Talmud, Beth Shammai allows only the betrothed woman
							to refuse because if the married woman also was able to refuse, men
							would not want to spend the money involved in marrying a minor, lest
							she later refuse the marriage. Section two: If the minor girl was
							married off by her mother or brother and then her husband died,
							according to Beth Shammai she cannot make a declaration against her
							yavam. Rather she must wait until she reaches majority age and then
							request halitzah. However, according to Beth Hillel she may make such a
							declaration against the yavam as well. However, even though she has
							annulled her marriage to the yavam’s brother, she cannot at a later
							point marry the yavam, since she was at one point his brother’s wife.
							Section three: According to Beth Shammai, she must make the declaration
							of refusal in front of him. According to Beth Hillel, this is not
							necessary. Section four: According to Beth Shammai, she must make the
							declaration of refusal in front of a court. According to Beth Hillel,
							this is not necessary. Section five: According to Beth Hillel, as long
							as she is still a minor, she may be married off as many times as her
							brothers and mother wish and she may later refuse as many marriages as
							they offer. Beth Shammai offers a moral objection to this possibility,
							for through it a girl could be betrothed (but according to Beth Shammai
							not married) to several men without ever having received a get. Rather
							she either waits until she is an adult or makes a declaration of
							refusal and then marries immediately, at which point she could no
							longer refuse, according to Beth Shammai. Note that this last section
							is phrased differently than the previous sections. According to some
							mishnaic commentators, since Beth Shammai explains their position the
							halakhah is according to them in this section. In all of the other
							sections, the halakhah follows Beth Hillel, as it usually does.

							Which minor must make the declaration of refusal? Any whose mother or
							brothers have given her in marriage with her consent. If they gave her
							in marriage without her consent she need not make any declaration of
							refusal. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: Any child who is unable to
							take care of her token of betrothal need not make any declaration of
							refusal. Rabbi Eliezer says: The act of a minor has no validity at all,
							rather she is to be regarded as one seduced. The daughter of an
							Israelite who was married to a priest may not eat terumah, and the
							daughter of a priest who was married to an Israelite may eat terumah.

							If a minor made a declaration of refusal against a man, he is permitted

							he gave her a get and remarried her and then she a made a declaration
							of refusal against him, and then she was married to another man and

							she made a declaration of refusal against him and then he remarried

							If two brothers were married to two sisters who were minors and

							Gamaliel says: If she made a declaration of refusal, then she did so;

							be free since she is the the yavam’s wife's sister. Rabbi Joshua says:

							If a man who was married to two minors orphans died, intercourse or

							rival. If one was of sound senses and one was deaf, intercourse with
							the woman of sound senses exempts the deaf woman, but intercourse with

							If a deaf man married a woman of sound senses or a man of sound senses

							he became deaf or insane, he may never divorce her. Rabbi Yohanan ben

							became deaf may not divorce his wife? They answered him: a man who
							divorces is not like a woman who is divorced, for while a woman may be
							divorced with her consent and without her consent, a man can divorce

							Rabbi Akiva said: When I went down to Nehardea to intercalate the year,

							of one witness, except Rabbi Judah ben Bava”. “That is so”, I told him.
							He said to me, “Tell them in my name: ‘You know that this country is in
							confusion because of marauders. I have received a tradition from Rabban
							Gamaliel the Elder: that they allow a married woman to remarry on the
							evidence of one witness’”. And when I came and recounted the
							conversation in the presence of Rabban Gamaliel he rejoiced at my words
							and exclaimed, “We have found a match for Rabbi Judah ben Bava!” As a
							result of this talk Rabban Gamaliel remembered that some men were once
							killed at Tel Arza, and that Rabban Gamaliel the Elder had allowed
							their wives to marry again on the evidence of one witness, and the law
							was established that they allow a woman to marry again on the evidence
							of one witness, and on the testimony of one who states that he has
							heard from another witness, from a slave, from a woman or from a female
							slave. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua say: a woman is not be allowed to
							remarry on the evidence of one witness. Rabbi Akiva ruled: a woman is
							not allowed to marry again on the evidence of a woman, on that of a
							slave, on that of a female slave or on that of relatives. They said to
							him: It once happened that a number of Levites went to Tsoar, the city
							of palms, and one of them became ill on the way, and they left him in
							an inn. When they returned they asked the female innkeeper, “Where is
							our friend? ” And she replied, “He is dead and I buried him”, and they
							allowed his wife to remarry. Should not then a priest’s wife be
							believed at least as much as an innkeeper!” He answered them: When she
							will give such evidence as the innkeeper gave she will be believed, for
							the innkeeper had brought out to them the dead man’s staff, his bag and
							the Torah scroll which he had with him.

							He who eats with his father-in-law in Judea without the presence of

							with the sister of his wife, with the wife of his brother, with the
							wife of the brother of his father, or with a woman during menstruation,
							he has to pay the fine, for although these are punishable through

							And in the following cases there is no fine:If a man had intercourse

							redeemed, converted or freed after the age of three years and a day.
							Rabbi Judah says: a female captive who was redeemed is considered to be
							in her state of holiness (a virgin) even if she is of majority age. A
							man who had intercourse with his daughter, his daughter's daughter, his
							son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her son's daughter or her
							daughter's daughter does not pay the fine, because he forfeits his
							life, for his death is in the hands of the court, and he who forfeits
							his life pays no monetary fine for it is said, “And yet no other damage
							ensues he shall be fined” (Exodus 21:2.

							The seducer pays three forms of compensation and the rapist four. The
							seducer pays compensation for embarrassment and blemish and the fine;
							The rapist pays an additional form of compensation in that he pays for
							the pain. What is the difference between the penalties of a seducer and
							those of a rapist? The rapist pays compensation for the pain but the
							seducer does not pay compensation for the pain. The rapist pays
							immediately but the seducer pays only if he dismisses her. The rapist
							must “drink out of his pot” but the seducer may dismiss the girl if he
							wishes.

						Seder 3 - Nashim: Masekhet 2 - Ketubot: Perek 3: Mishnah 5

						-
							What is meant by “he must drink out of his pot”? Even if she is lame,
							even if she is blind and even if she is afflicted with boils he may not
							dismiss her. If she was found to have committed a licentious act or was
							unfit to marry an Israelite he may not continue to live with her, for
							it is said, “And she shall be for him a wife”(Deut. 22:29) a wife that
							is fit for him.

						Seder 3 - Nashim: Masekhet 2 - Ketubot: Perek 3: Mishnah 7
					-
						-
							How is the compensation that is paid for embarrassment reckoned? It all
							depends on the status of the offender and the offended. How is the
							compensation that is paid for blemish reckoned? She is regarded as if
							she were a slave to be sold in the market place and it is estimated how
							much she was worth then and how much she is worth now. The fine is the
							same for all. And any sum that is fixed in the Torah remains the same
							for all.

							Wherever there is the right of sale there is a fine and wherever there
							is a fine there is no right of sale. In the case of a minor there is

							there is a fine but no right of sale. In the case of a girl who has
							reached majority age there is no right of sale and there is no fine.

							If a young girl was seduced the compensation for her embarrassment and
							blemish and the fine belong to her father; and the compensation for
							pain in the case of one who was raped. If the girl’s case was tried
							before her father died all the forms of compensation are her father’s.
							If her father subsequently died they are her brothers’. If her father
							died before her case was tried they are hers. If her case was tried
							before she became of majority age all forms of compensation are her
							father’s. If her father subsequently died they are her brothers’. If
							she became of majority age before her case was tried they are hers.
							Rabbi Shimon says if her father died before she could collect the
							payments they belong to her. Her handiwork and anything she finds, even
							if she had not collected the proceeds belong to her brothers if her
							father died.

							If a man gave his daughter in betrothal and she was divorced, and then
							he gave her again in betrothal and she was widowed, her ketubah belongs
							to him. If he gave her in marriage and she was divorced and then he
							gave her again in marriage and she was left a widow, her ketubah
							belongs to her. Rabbi Judah said: the first belongs to her father. They
							said to him: as soon as he gives her in marriage, her father loses all

							The daughter of a convert who converted together with her mother and

							does her husband pay the hundred sela’. If she was conceived in
							unholiness but her birth was in holiness she is subject to the penalty
							of stoning. She is not stoned at the door of her father’s house nor
							does her husband pay the hundred sela’. If she was both conceived and
							born in holiness she is regarded as a daughter of Israel in all
							respects. A girl who has a father but no door of her father’s house; or
							a door of her father’s house but no father, is subject to the penalty
							of stoning the verse did not state “the opening of her father’s house”

							A father has authority over his daughter in her betrothal whether it
							was effected by money, document or intercourse. He is entitled to
							anything she finds, to her handiwork and to annul her vows. He receives
							her get but he has no usufruct from her property during her lifetime.
							When she marries, the husband surpasses him in his rights in that he
							has usufruct during her lifetime. And he is obligated to feed her, to
							pay a ransom for her and to provide for her burial. Rabbi Judah says:
							even the poorest man in Israel must provide no less than two flutes and
							one lamenting woman.

							She remains in the domain of her father until she enters the domain of

							father’s agents went with the husband’s agents she remains in the
							domain of her father. If her father’s agents delivered her to the
							husband’s agents she passes into the domain of her husband.

							A father is not obligated to maintain his daughter. This exposition was

							of Yavneh: “The sons shall inherit their mother’s kethubah and the
							daughters shall be maintained out of their father’s estate” just as the
							sons do not inherit except after the death of their father, so the

							If he did not write a kethubah for her, a virgin still collects two
							hundred zuz and a widow one mane, because it is a condition laid down
							by court. If he assigned to her in writing a field that was worth one

							If she was taken captive he is obligated to ransom her; And if he said,

							Although the Sages have said: a virgin collects two hundred and a widow
							one maneh, if he wishes to add, even a hundred maneh, he may do
							so.After betrothal but before marriage, a virgin collects two hundred
							zuz and a widow only one maneh, for the man wrote her the additional
							amount in order to marry her. If she was widowed or divorced, either
							after betrothal or after marriage, she is entitled to collect the
							entire amount. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: a woman widowed or
							divorced after marriage receives the entire amount; Rabbi Judah says:
							if he wishes he may write for a virgin a document for two hundred zuz
							and she writes “I have received from you a maneh”, or for a widow he
							may write a document for a maneh and she writes, “I have received from
							you fifty zuz”. Rabbi Meir says: Any man who gives a virgin less than
							two hundred zuz or a widow less than a maneh is engaging in licentious
							sex.

							A virgin is given twelve months from the time her intended husband
							claimed her, in which to prepare herself for marriage. Just as such a
							period is given to the woman, so is it given to the man to prepare
							himself. A widow is given thirty days. If the time has come and they
							were not married they are entitled to receive maintenance from the
							man’s estate and if he is a priest they may eat terumah. Rabbi Tarfon
							says: They give her all of her food in terumah. Rabbi Akiva says: One
							half unconsecrated food and one half terumah.

							A yavam who is a priest does not allow his sister-in-law to eat

							months waiting for the yavam, or even if she spent all of them waiting
							for her husband less one day waiting for the yavam, or all of them
							waiting for the yavam less one day waiting for her husband, she may not
							eat terumah. This was the ruling according to the first mishnah. The

							The following are the kinds of work which a woman must perform for her

							to work in wool; for idleness leads to unchastity. Cooking, Nursing her
							child, Preparing his bed, And working in wool. If she brought two
							slave-women, she need not cook or nurse her child. If three, she need
							not prepare his bed or work in wool. If four, she may lounge in an easy
							chair. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if a man forbade his wife under
							a vow to do any work he must divorce her and give her kethubah to her
							for idleness leads to insanity.

							If a man provides for his wife through an agent, he must give her every

							oil; and a kav of dried figs or a maneh of pressed figs, and if he has
							no such fruit he must supply her with a corresponding quantity of other
							fruit. He must also provide her with a bed, a mattress and a mat. He
							must also give her a hat for her head and a girdle for her loins;
							shoes, from festival to festival; and clothing worth fifty zuz every
							year. She is not to be given new clothes in the summer or worn-out
							clothes in the winter, but must be given clothes worth fifty zuz during

							If a woman agreed to bring her husband one thousand denarii he must
							agree to give her a corresponding sum of fifteen maneh. As a
							corresponding sum for appraised goods, he agrees to give one-fifth
							less. If a husband is requested to enter in his wife's ketubah “goods
							assessed at one maneh”, and these are in fact worth a maneh, he only
							must agree to a maneh. Otherwise, if he is requested to enter in the
							ketubah: “goods assessed at a maneh”, his wife must give him thirty-one
							sela and a denar, and if “at four hundred”, she must give him goods
							valued at five hundred. Whatever a bridegroom agrees to give his wife

							with us you will receive no maintenance”. If she claimed that she

							There were two judges of fines in Jerusalem, Admon and Hanan ben

							The sons of the high priests differed from him and ruled that she must

							All the substitutes for vows have the validity of vows. Those for

							vow”; “I am separated from you”; “I am distanced from you”, “that I
							should eat from yours”, “that I should taste from yours”, he is
							prohibited. If he says: “I am banned to you”, Rabbi Akiba was inclined
							to rule stringently. If one says “As the vows of the wicked”, he has
							vowed in respect of being a nazirite, or a sacrifice, or an oath. If he
							says “As the vows of the fit”, he has said nothing. But if he said “As
							their freewill-offerings” he has vowed in respect of being nazirite and
							a sacrifice.

							“As the altar”, “As the Temple” or “As Jerusalem”; or if one vowed by

							And these vows are not binding: One who says “What I eat of yours shall
							be unconsecrated”; “As the flesh of the swine”; “As an object of
							idolatrous worship”; “As hides pierced at the heart”; “As carrion”; “As
							terefoth”; “As abominations”; “As creeping things”; “As Aaron’s dough”;
							“As his terumah”--in all these cases the vow is not binding. If one
							says to his wife, “Behold! You are like my mother to me”, he must be
							given an opening on other grounds, in order that he should not act
							lightly in such matters. If one says, “Konam if I sleep”; “If I speak”;
							or “If I walk”; or if one says to his wife, “Konam if I cohabit with
							you,” he is liable to the biblical prohibition “he shall not break his
							word” (Numbers 30:. If he says, “I swear an oath not to sleep”, or,
							“talk,” or, “walk,” he is forbidden to do so.

							If he says, “A korban should be what I do not eat of yours”; “By a

							korban to me” the vow is not binding. If he says, “An oath that I will
							not eat of yours”; “An oath that I eat of yours”; “No oath that I will
							not eat of yours” his oath is valid. In these instances oaths are more
							stringent than vows. There is also greater stringency in vows than in
							oaths. How so? If one says, “Konam be the sukkah that I make,”; “The
							lulav that I take”; “The tefillin that I put on”; as vows they are
							binding, but as oaths they are not, because one cannot swear to
							transgress the commandments.

							eats it, he is liable for each and every one. “I swear that I will not

							Unspecified vows are interpreted strictly, but if specified they are

							salted meat”; or “As wine of libation” If he vowed by that which is to
							Heaven, his vow is valid. If by that which is idolatrous, his vow is
							invalid. And if it was unspecified, his vow is valid. If he says,
							“Behold! This is to me as herem” If as a herem to Heaven, his vow is
							valid; If as a herem to the priests, his vow is invalid. If it was
							unspecified, his vow is valid. “Behold! This is to me as a tithe” If he
							vowed, as tithes of beasts, his vow is valid. If as grain tithes, his
							vow is invalid. If unspecified, his vow is valid. “Behold! This is to
							me as terumah” If he vowed, as the terumah of the Temple-chamber, his
							vow is valid. If as the terumah of the threshing-floor, his vow is
							invalid. If unspecified, his vow is valid. The words of Rabbi Meir.
							Rabbi Judah says: An unspecified reference to terumah in Judea is a
							valid vow, but not in Galilee, because the Galileans are unfamiliar
							with the terumah of the Temple-chamber. Unspecified references to
							haramim in Judea are not binding but in Galilee they are, because the
							Galileans are unfamiliar with priestly haramim.

							Four types of vows the Sages have invalidated: Vows of incentive, vows

							incentive how so? If one was selling an article and said, “Konam that I
							will not reduce below a sela”; and the other replied, “Konam that I
							will not add above a shekel” both of them want a price of three
							denarii. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: Also one who wishes to subject
							his friend to a vow to eat with him, may say: “Every vow which I may
							make in the future shall be void”, providing that he remembers this at
							the time of the vow.

							Vows of exaggeration: If one says, “Konam if I did not see on this road

							I ate or drank”, and then remembered that he had; “If I eat or drink”
							and then forgot his vow and ate or drank; “Konam be any benefit which
							my wife has from me, because she stole my purse or beat my child, and
							it was subsequently learnt that she had not beaten him nor stolen”; If
							one saw people eating his figs and said to them, “Let the figs be a
							korban to you,” and then discovered the people to be his father or his
							brothers. If others were with them: Beth Shammai says: his father and
							brothers are permitted, but the rest are forbidden. Beth Hillel says:

							says: he may do so. Beth Shammai says: he may vow only as far as he
							makes him vow; Beth Hillel says: even in respect of what he does not
							make him vow. How so? If they said to him, say: “Konam be any benefit
							my wife has of me”, and he said, “Konam be any benefit my wife and
							children have of me,” Beth Shammai says: his wife is permitted, but his

							known that he would become a scribe or was about to give his son in

							“Konam is this house which I will not enter, because it contains a wild

							They release a vow by reference to a wife’s kethubah. And it once

							amounted to four hundred denarii. He went before Rabbi Akiva, who
							ordered him to pay her the ketubah in full. He said to him, “Rabbi! My
							father left eight hundred denarii, of which my brother took four
							hundred and I took four hundred. Isn’t it enough that she should
							receive two hundred and I two hundred? ” Rabbi Akiva replied: even if
							you have to sell the hair of your head you must pay her her ketubah. He
							said to him, “Had I known that it is so, I would not have vowed.” And
							Rabbi Akiva released his vow.

							the last one was released, he is released, but the rest are forbidden.
							if the middle person was released, those mentioned after him are also
							released, but those mentioned before him are forbidden. If one says,

							taste, because they are damaging to the heart.” They said to him, “But

							whom he himself acquired, isn’t it logical that can he annul those of a
							woman bequeathed to him by Heaven! Rabbi Akiva said to him: No! If you
							speak of a woman whom he himself acquires, that is because others have
							no rights in her; will you say the same of a woman given to him by
							Heaven, in whom others too have rights! Rabbi Joshua said to him:
							Akiva, your words apply to two yevamim; but what will you answer if
							there is only one yavam? He (Rabbi Akiva) said to him (Rabbi Joshua):
							the yevamah is not as completely acquired to the yavam as a betrothed

							the force of prohibition! They said to him: behold, it is said, “Her

							“But every vow of a widow and of a divorcee… shall be binding upon her”
							(Numbers 30:9).How is this so? If she said, “Behold, I will be a
							nazirite after thirty days”, even if she married within the thirty
							days, he cannot annul it. If she vows while in her husband’s domain, he
							can annul the vow for her. How is this so? If she said, “Behold, I will
							be a nazirite after thirty days,” and her husband annulled it, even
							though she was widowed or divorced within the thirty days, it is
							annulled. If she vowed on one day, and he divorced her on the same day
							and took her back on the same day, he cannot annul it. This is the
							general rule: once she has gone into her own domain even for a single
							hour, he cannot annul.

							nazirite like Samson and a life-nazirite? A life-nazirite if his hair
							becomes burdensome, he may thin it with a razor and then offer three
							animal sacrifices. If he should he be ritually defiled, he must offer
							the sacrifice prescribed for defilement. The nazirite like Samson if
							his hair becomes burdensome, he may not thin it. And if he becomes

							or “Behold, I am a nazirite, once and a half,” he becomes a nazirite
							for two periods of naziriteship. If one says, “Behold, I am a nazirite

							with the herd? Beth Shammai said to them: do you not admit that if a

							or the eleventh the tenth, each is consecrated? Beth Hillel said to

							Three things are forbidden to a nazirite: ritual defilement, shaving
							and products of the vine. Defilement and shaving have a stringency that
							products of the vine do not have, in that defilement and shaving annul
							the period of naziriteship already observed, whereas partaking of
							products of the vine does not do so. Products of the vine have a
							stringency that defilement or shaving do not have, in that products of
							the vine permit of no exception from the general prohibition, whereas
							defilement and shaving are allowed as exception from the general
							prohibition in the case where shaving is a religious duty, or where
							there is a neglected corpse. And defilement has a stringency that
							shaving does not have, in that defilement annuls the whole period of
							naziriteship already served, and a nazirite who is defiled is liable
							for a sacrifice, whereas shaving annuls only thirty days and he is not
							liable for a sacrifice.

							Shaving on account of defilement: How was it done? He would sprinkle
							with purification water on the third and seventh days, shave on the
							seventh day and bring his sacrifices on the eighth day. If he shaved on
							the eighth day, he would bring his sacrifices on that same day, the
							words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon said to him: what difference is
							there between this one and a person with scale disease? He said to him:
							the purification of this one depends on his days, whereas the
							purification of one with scale disease depends on his shaving, and he
							cannot bring a sacrifice unless the sun has set upon him after his
							purification.

							Shaving in a case of purity: How was it done? He would bring three
							animals, a sin-offering, a burnt-offering, and a well-being offering,
							slaughter the peace-offering and shave thereafter, the words of Rabbi
							Judah. Rabbi Elazar says: he shaves after the sin-offering, for in all
							cases the sacrifice of the sin-offering takes precedence. But if he
							shaved after the slaughter of any one of the three he has fulfilled his
							obligation.

							Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if he brought three animals without
							specifying what they were for, the one suitable for a sin offering is
							sacrificed as a sin offering, for a burnt offering as a burnt offering,
							and for a well-being offering as a well-being offering. He would then
							take the hair of his nazirite head and threw it under the cauldron. If
							he shaved in the province he also would throw it under the cauldron.
							With regard to what was this said? With regard to shaving in ritual
							purity, whereas in shaving after ritual defilement he does not throw it
							under the cauldron. Rabbi Meir says: all nazirites throw it under the
							cauldron, except for the defiled nazirite who shaved in the provinces.

							He would then boil or completely boil the peace-offering. The priest
							then took the boiled shoulder of the ram, an unleavened cake from the
							basket, and an unleavened wafer, placed them on the nazirite’s hands
							and waved them. After this, the nazirite was allowed to drink wine and
							defile himself for the dead. Rabbi Shimon says: as soon as one kind of
							blood had been sprinkled on his behalf the nazirite could drink wine
							and defile himself for the dead.

							If he shaves after one of the sacrifices and the sacrifice is found to
							be invalid, his shaving is invalid and his sacrifices do not count: If
							he shaves after the sin-offering, which was not offered for its correct
							designation and then he brought the other sacrifices under their
							correct designations, his shaving is invalid and none of his sacrifices
							counts for him. Similarly, if he shaves after the burnt-offering or the
							wellbeing offering, which have not been offered for their correct
							designation, and then he brought the other sacrifices under their
							correct designation, his shaving is invalid and none of his sacrifices
							counts for him. Rabbi Shimon says: that particular sacrifice does not
							count, but his other sacrifices do count. If he shaved after all three
							sacrifices and one of them was found to valid, his shaving is valid and
							he has only to bring the other sacrifices.

							A high priest and a nazirite may not defile themselves with their dead
							relatives, but they may defile themselves with a neglected corpse. If
							they were walking on the path and found a neglected corpse: Rabbi
							Eliezer says: the high priest should defile himself but not the
							nazirite. But the Sages say: the nazirite should defile himself but not
							the high priest. Rabbi Eliezer said to them: the priest should defile
							himself, for he does not offer a sacrifice for his defilement, and the
							nazirite should not defile himself, for he does offer a sacrifice on
							defilement. They said to him: the nazirite should defile himself, for
							his holiness is not permanent, and the priest should not defile

							For which types of defilement must the nazirite shave? For defilement
							contracted from a corpse, or an olive’s bulk of the flesh of a corpse,
							or an olive’s bulk of corpse ooze, or a ladleful of corpse-mould; Or
							the spinal column, or the skull, or any limb severed from a corpse, or
							any limb severed from a living body that is still properly covered with
							flesh, or a half-kav of bones, or a half-log of blood. Whether the
							defilement was contracted from contact with them, from carrying them,
							or from overshadowing them. For defilement contracted from a
							barley-grain’s bulk of bone, whether by contact or carrying. On account
							of these, a nazirite must shave and be sprinkled on the third and
							seventh days, and such defilement annuls the previously served period,
							and he does not begin to count a new naziriteship until he has become
							clean and brought his sacrifices.
						-
					-
						Seder 3 - Nashim: Masekhet 4 - Nazir: Perek 7: Mishnah 3

							But for defilement contracted by overhanging branches, or protruding
							stones, or a field that may have once been a cemetery, or land of the
							Gentiles, or the stone which covers the tomb or the supporting stone of
							a tomb, or a quarter-log of blood, or a tent, or a quarter-kav of
							bones, or utensils that have been in contact with a corpse, or on
							account of the days of counting after contracting scale disease or the
							days during which he is certified unclean because of scale disease; For
							all these the nazirite is not required to shave, but they do sprinkle
							him on the third and seventh days, and the defilement does not annul
							the formerly served period, and he begins to resume counting his
							naziriteship immediately after purification and there is no sacrifice.
							In fact they said: the days of defilement of a male or female sufferer
							from gonorrhea and the days that a leper is shut up as a leper count
							toward his naziriteship.

							Two nazirites to whom someone says, “I saw one of you defiled, but I do
							not know which of you it was,” Both must shave and together bring
							sacrifices for defilement and sacrifices for completing a naziriteship
							in purity, and one of them must say, “If I am unclean, the sacrifices
							for defilement are mine, and the sacrifices in purity are yours,
							whereas if I am the one who is clean, the sacrifices in purity are mine
							and the sacrifices for defilement are yours.” And they must then count
							thirty more days and bring sacrifices in purity and one of them must
							say, “If I am the one who was unclean, the sacrifices for defilement
							were mine, the sacrifices in purity were yours, and these are my
							sacrifices in purity, whereas if I was the one who was clean, the
							sacrifices in purity were mine, the sacrifices for defilement were
							yours, and these are your sacrifices in purity.” If one of them dies:
							Rabbi Joshua said that the other should request that someone from the
							marketplace take a nazirite vow together with him, and say: “If I am
							unclean, you are to be a nazirite immediately, but if I was clean, you
							are to become a nazirite at the end of thirty days.” They then count
							thirty days and bring sacrifices for defilement and sacrifices for
							completing a naziriteship in purity and the first one says, “If I am
							the one who was unclean, the sacrifices for defilement are mine and the
							sacrifices in purity are yours, whereas if I am the one who is clean,
							the sacrifices in purity are mine and the sacrifices for defilement are
							sacrifices offered in doubt.” They then count another thirty days and
							bring one set of the sacrifices in purity and the first one says, “If I
							am the one who was defiled, the sacrifice for defilement offered
							previously was mine and the sacrifice in purity was yours, and this is
							my sacrifice in purity, whereas if I was the one who was clean, the
							sacrifice in purity was mine and the sacrifice for defilement was
							offered in doubt and this is your sacrifice in purity.” Ben Zoma said
							to him: Who will listen to him and take a nazirite vow together with
							him? Rather he must bring a bird as a sin offering and an animal as a
							burnt offering and say, “If I was defiled, the sin offering is part of
							my obligation and the burnt offering is a voluntary offering, whereas
							if I remained clean, the burnt-offering is part of my obligation and
							the sin offering is a sacrifice offered in doubt.” ‘ He must then count
							thirty days and bring the sacrifices in purity and say, “If I was
							defiled, the former burnt offering was a voluntary offering and this is
							part of my obligation, whereas if I remained clean, the former burnt
							offering was part of my obligation and this is the voluntary one. And
							these are the rest of my sacrifices.” Rabbi Joshua said: the result is
							that he brings his sacrifices half at a time! But the Sages agreed with
							Ben zoma.

							Gentiles are not subject to the laws of naziriteship. Women and slaves
							are subject to the laws of naziriteship. The nazirite vow is more
							stringent in the case of women than in the case of slaves, for a man
							can compel his slave to break his vow but he cannot compel his wife to
							do so. The nazirite vow is more stringent in the case of slaves than in
							the case of women, for he can void the vows of his wife, but he cannot
							void the vows of his slaves. If he voids his wife’s vow, it is void for
							ever, but if he voids his slave’s vow, if the slave becomes free he
							must complete his naziriteship. When the slave passes from his master's
							presence: Rabbi Meir says: he may not drink wine. Rabbi Yose says: he
							may drink wine.

							A nazirite shaves and then discovers that he was defiled: If the
							defilement was certain, it voids the naziriteship, But if it is a
							defilement of the depth, it is not rendered void. If he discovers that
							he was defiled before shaving, in either case it voids the
							naziriteship. How is the law regarding ‘defilement of the depth’? If he
							goes down into a cavern to bathe, and a corpse is found floating at the
							mouth of the cavern, he is definitely unclean. If it is found embedded
							in the floor of the cavern, Then if he went in merely to cool himself
							off he remains clean, But if he went to purify himself after defilement
							through contact with the dead he remains unclean, Because the
							assumption concerning an unclean person is that he is unclean and the
							assumption concerning a clean person is that he is clean,.

							from four to eight cubits, this is a graveyard site. He must check from
							that point twenty cubits in all directions. If he finds one twenty
							cubits away, he must check from it another twenty cubits, for there are
							grounds that it is a graveyard. For if he had found it at the outset he
							would have removed it and the soil that it occupies.

							Any matter of doubt regarding leprous affliction at the outset is clean

							liable for murder. Rabbi Nehemiah exempts him, for there are grounds

							She had barely finished drinking when her face turns yellow, her eyes

							for two years, and some merit suspends the effect for three years.
							Hence Ben Azzai said: a person must teach his daughter Torah, so that
							if she has to drink the water of bitterness, she should know that the
							merit suspends its effect. Rabbi Eliezer says: whoever teaches his

							defiled and can be redeemed. But if it became defiled after it had been
							sanctified in the ministering vessel, behold it is like all
							meal-offerings similarly defiled and it is burned. These are the ones
							whose meal-offerings are burned: She who says, “I am defiled to you”;
							And when witnesses came and testified that she had been defiled; She
							who says “I refuse to drink”, She whose husband refuses to let her
							drink; And she whose husband had relations with her on the journey to

							The meal-offering of the daughter of an Israelite who is married to a
							priest is burned. But the meal-offering of the daughter of a priest who
							is married to an Israelite is eaten. What differences are there in law
							between a priest and a priest's daughter? The meal-offering of a
							priest’s daughter is eaten but the meal-offering of a priest is not
							eaten. A priest’s daughter may become deconsecrated, but a priest does
							not become deconsecrated. A priest’s daughter may defile herself by
							contact with the dead, but a priest may not defile himself by contact
							with the dead. A priest eats of the most holy things, but a priest’s
							daughter may not eat of the most holy things.

							unclean). This teaches that a loaf which is unclean in the second

							in the third degree. Rabbi Joshua said: who will remove the dust from
							your eyes, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, since you used to say that in the
							future another generation will pronounce clean a loaf which is unclean
							in the third degree on the grounds that there is no text in the Torah
							according to which it is unclean! Has not Rabbi Akiva your student

							For it would have been logical: Now if the first evidence that the
							woman had secluded herself with the man, which does not prohibit her to
							her husband for all time, is not established by fewer than two
							witnesses, is it not logical that the final evidence that she had been
							defiled which does prohibit her to him for all time, should not be
							established by fewer than two witnesses! Scripture states, “And there
							is no witness against her” (Numbers 5:13) whatever testimony there may
							be against her is believed. And now with respect to the first evidence
							about her seclusion with the man there is an a fortiori (kal vehomer)
							argument: Now if the final evidence regarding her being defiled, which
							prohibits her to her husband for all time, is established by one
							witness, is it not logical that the first evidence, which does not
							prohibit her to him for all time, should be established by one witness!
							Scripture states, “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her”
							(Deuteronomy 24:1), and elsewhere Scripture states, “By the mouth of
							two witnesses ... shall the matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15);
							just as the “matter” mentioned in this latter case must be based on the

							How were the blessings and curses pronounced? When Israel crossed the

							the vicinity of Shechem which is near the terebinths of Moreh, as it is
							said, “Are they not the other side of the Jordan, beyond the west road
							that is in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near
							Gilgal, by the terebinths of Moreh (Deut. 11:30), and elsewhere it
							says, “And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem unto
							the terebinth of Moreh” (Genesis 12:6) just as the terebinth of Moreh
							mentioned in this latter verse is Shechem, so the terebinth of Moreh
							mentioned in the former verse is Shechem. Six tribes went up Mt.
							Gerizim and six tribes went up Mt. Ebal, and the priests and Levites
							with the ark stood below in the middle, the priests surrounding the
							ark, the Levites surrounding the priests, and all Israel on this side
							and that side, as it is said, “And all Israel, with their elders,
							officials, and judges stood on both sides of the ark, facing the
							levitical priests” (Joshua 8:33). They turned their faces towards Mt.
							Gerizim and opened with the blessing: Blessed be anyone who does not
							make a graven or molten image”. And these and these respond amen. They
							then turned their faces towards Mt. Ebal and opened with the curse:
							“Cursed be anyone who makes a graven or molten image” (Deut. 27:15).
							And these and these respond amen. So they continue until they complete
							the blessings and curses. After that they brought the stones, built the
							altar and plastered it with plaster, and inscribed upon it all the
							words of the Torah in seventy languages, as it is said, “most
							distinctly (be’er hetev). Then they took the stones and went and spent
							the night in their place.

							How was the priestly blessing pronounced? In the province (outside of

							the province in its substituted name. In the province the priests raise
							their hands at the height of their shoulders, but in the Temple above
							their heads, except the high priest who does not raise his hands higher
							than the frontlet (on his forehead). Rabbi Judah says: even the high
							priest raises his hands higher than the frontlet, as it says, “And
							Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them”

							following portions: “After the death” (Leviticus 16:1-34), and “But on
							the tenth day” (Leviticus 23:26-32). Then he rolls the Torah (scroll),
							places it in his bosom and exclaims, “More than I have read before you
							is written here!” The portion, “On the tenth day” (Numbers 29:7-11),
							which is in the book of Numbers, he reads by heart. And he blesses upon
							it eight benedictions: “For the Torah”, “For the Temple service”, “For
							thanksgiving”, “For the pardon of sin”, “For the Temple”, “For Israel”,
							“For the priests”, viii) and the rest of the prayer.

							When the anointed for battle addresses the people he speaks in the holy
							tongue, as it is said, “And it shall be, when you draw near the battle,
							that the priest shall approach” (Deuteronomy 20:2) this refers to the
							anointed for battle. “And speak to the people” (ibid) – in the holy
							tongue. “He shall say to them, “Hear, O Israel, you are about to join
							battle with your enemy” (vs. “with your enemy” but not against your
							brother, not Judah against Shimon nor Shimon against Benjamin, that if
							you fall into their hand they shall have mercy on you, as it is said,
							“Then the men named above proceeded to take the captives in hand, and
							with booty they clothed all the naked among them they clothed them and
							shod them and gave them to eat and drink and anointed them and provide
							donkeys for all who were failing and brought them to Jericho, the city
							of palms, back to their kinsmen. Then they returned to Samaria” (II
							Chronicles 28:15). Rather against your enemies do you march, so that if
							you fall into their hand they will have no mercy on you. “Let not your
							courage falter, fear not, and do not tremble or be in dread of them”
							(Deuteronomy 20: “Let not your courage falter”-- at the neighing of the
							horses and the brandishing of swords; “Fear not” --at the crash of
							shields and the tramp of the soldiers shoes; “Do not tremble” -- at the
							sound of trumpets; “Or be in dread of them” -- at the sound of battle
							cries. “For it is the Lord your God that goes with you”--they come
							relying upon the might of flesh and blood, but you come relying upon
							the might of the Omnipresent. The Philistines came relying upon the
							power of Goliath (I Samuel 17:4 ff.), but what happened to him in the
							end? In the end he fell by the sword and they fell with him. The
							Ammonites came relying upon the power of Shobach (II Samuel 10:16-18),
							but what happened to him in the end? In the end he fell by the sword
							and they fell with him. But with you it is otherwise, “For it is the
							Lord your God is that goes with you” this refers to the camp of the

							because of the transgressions he has committed; therefore the Torah
							connected all these other categories of those who return home with him
							that he may return home on their account. Rabbi Yose says: a high
							priest who married a widow, an ordinary priest who married a divorcee

							The declaration over the heifer whose neck is to be broken must be in

							not floating on the surface of the water. If it was found near the
							border, or a city whose majority of inhabitants were Gentiles, or a

							neck. They only measure the distance from a city in which there is a
							court. If the corpse was found exactly between two cities, both of them
							bring two heifers between them, the words of Rabbi Eliezer; Jerusalem
							does not bring a heifer whose neck is to be broken.

							The elders of Jerusalem departed and went away. The elders of that city

							wadi “etan” is understood in its literal sense of “hard”. Even if it is
							not “hard”, it is valid for the ceremony. They break its neck with a

							The elders of that city then wash their hands with water in the place

							did we really think that the elders of a court of justice are shedders
							of blood! Rather, the intention of their statement is that the man
							found dead did not come to us for help and we dismissed him without
							supplying him with food and we did not see him and let him go without
							escort. Then the priests exclaim, “Absolve, O Lord, Your people Israel,
							whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent
							remain among your people Israel” (vs.. They did not need to say, “And
							they will be absolved of bloodguilt” (ibid), rather the Holy Spirit

							When Rabbi Meir died, the composers of fables ceased. When Ben Azzai

							Yose Katnuta died, the pious men (hasidim) ceased and why was his name
							called Katnuta? Because he was the youngest of the pious men. When
							Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai died, the splendor of wisdom ceased. When
							Rabban Gamaliel the elder died, the glory of the torah ceased, and
							purity and separateness perished. When Rabbi Ishmael ben Fabi died, the
							splendor of the priesthood ceased. When Rabbi died, humility and fear
							of sin ceased. Rabbi Phineas ben Yair says: when Temple was destroyed,
							scholars and freemen were ashamed and covered their head, men of
							wondrous deeds were disregarded, and violent men and big talkers grew
							powerful. And nobody expounds, nobody seeks, and nobody asks. Upon whom
							shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven. Rabbi Eliezer the
							Great says: from the day the Temple was destroyed, the sages began to
							be like scribes, scribes like synagogue-attendants,
							synagogue-attendants like common people, and the common people became
							more and more debased. And nobody seeks. Upon whom shall we depend?
							Upon our father who is in heaven. In the footsteps of the messiah
							insolence (hutzpah) will increase and the cost of living will go up
							greatly; the vine will yield its fruit, but wine will be expensive; the
							government will turn to heresy, and there will be no one to rebuke; the
							meeting-place of scholars will be used for licentiousness; the Galilee
							will be destroyed, the Gablan will be desolated, and the dwellers on
							the frontier will go about begging from place to place without anyone
							to take pity on them; the wisdom of the learned will rot, fearers of
							sin will be despised, and the truth will be lacking; youths will put
							old men to shame, the old will stand up in the presence of the young,
							“For son spurns father, daughter rises up against mother,
							daughter-in-law against mother-in-law a man’s own household are his
							enemies” (Micah 7:6). The face of the generation will be like the face
							of a dog, a son will not feel ashamed before his father. Upon whom
							shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven. Rabbi Pinchas ben
							Yair says, “Heedfulness leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to
							purity, purity leads to separation, separation leads to holiness,
							holiness leads to modesty, modesty leads to fear of sin, fear of sin
							leads to piety, piety leads to the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit leads
							to the resurrection of the dead, and the resurrection of the dead comes
							from Elijah, blessed be his memory, Amen.”

							Any get which is not written expressly for the woman for whom it is

							street and heard the voice of a scribe dictating “So-and-so divorces
							so-and-so from such and such a place” and he says “that is my name and
							that is the name of my wife”, it is not a valid document with which to
							divorce his wife. Moreover: if he wrote a get with which to divorce his
							wife and changed his mind and a person found him and said to him, “My
							name is the same as yours and my wife’s name the same as your wife's”,
							it is not a valid document with which the second may divorce his wife.
							Moreover: if he had two wives with the same name and wrote a get with
							which to divorce the elder, he may not use it to divorce the younger.
							Moreover: if he said to the scribe, “Write a get and I will divorce

							brings a get and left the husband when the husband was an old man or
							sick, he should deliver it to her on the presumption that he is still
							alive. If the daughter of an ordinary Israelite is married to a priest
							and her husband goes abroad, she continues eating terumah on the

							concerning people in a besieged town which has been captured; Or people
							in a ship which has been lost at sea; Or a person who has been led out
							to execution we put upon them all of the stringencies of their being
							alive and all of the stringencies of their being dead. The daughter of

							If man sends a get to his wife and then catches up with the messenger,

							Originally, a husband would bring together a court wherever he was and

							wife’s town. Rabban Gamaliel the Elder established that he should

							A non-Jewish slave of a Jew was taken captive and then ransomed by a

							If he is ransomed as a free man he does not go back to slavery. Rabban
							Shimon ben Gamaliel says: in either case he goes back to slavery. If a
							man makes his slave a pledge for a debt to another man and then he
							emancipates him, according to the “letter of the law” the slave is not
							liable to do anything. But because of tikkun olam we force his second
							master to emancipate him and he the slave writes a document for his
							purchase price. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the slave does not
							write the document but rather the one who emancipates him.

							One who is half a slave and half free works for his master one day and

							things right for the slave. He cannot marry a female slave because he
							is already half free, and he cannot marry a free woman because he is
							half a slave. Shall he then decease from having children? But wasn’t
							the world only made to be populated, as it says, “He did not create it
							as a waste, he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18)? Rather
							because of tikkun olam we compel his master to emancipate him and he

							If a man sells his slave to a Gentile or to someone living outside the

							says that the reason is to prevent the ill-treatment of fellow
							captives. Torah scrolls of the law, tefillin and mezuzoth are not
							bought from Gentiles at more than their value, because of tikkun olam.

							If a man divorces his wife because of ill-repute, he cannot remarry

							a sage, he may remarry her. Rabbi Eliezer says: they only forbid that

							does so, if the husband wants to retract he may not do so. Therefore if
							the husband said to him, “I do not want you to receive it on her
							behalf, but rather carry it and give it to her”, then if he wishes to
							retract he may do so. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even if the wife

							A woman who said to an agent, “Receive my get for me” requires two sets
							of witnesses, two to say, “In our presence she told him”, and two to
							say, “In our presence he received the get and tore it”. Even if the
							first set are the same witnesses as the latter set or if there was one
							in the first set and one in the second, and one joined with them for
							both testimonies. If a young girl is betrothed, both she and her father
							may receive her get. Rabbi Judah said that two different hands cannot
							take possession as one. Rather her father alone may receive her get.
							One who is not able to keep her get is not capable of being divorced.

							If a young girl says, “Receive my get for me”, it is not a get until
							the get reaches her hand. Therefore, if the husband wishes to retract,
							he may retract, since a minor cannot appoint an agent. But if her
							father said to him, “Go and receive a get for my daughter”, the husband
							may not retract. If a man says, “Give this get to my wife in
							such-and-such a place” and he gives it to her in another place, the get
							is invalid. If he says, “She is in such-and-such a place”, and he gives
							it to her in another place, it is valid. If a woman says, “Receive my
							get in such-and-such a place” and he receives it for her in another
							place, it is invalid. Rabbi Elazar says it valid. If she says, “Bring
							me my get from such-and-such a place” and he brings it from somewhere
							else, it is valid.

							If a woman says to an agent, “Bring me my get”, she may eat terumah

							reaches that place. Rabbi Elazar says that she is forbidden

							If a man says, “Write a get and give it to my wife”, or “Divorce her”,
							or “Write a letter and give it to her”, then they should write it and
							give it to her. If he said, “Release her”, or “Provide for her”, or “Do
							for her as the law dictates”, or “Do the proper thing for her”, he has
							not said anything. Originally they said that if a man was being led out
							to execution and said, “Write a get for my wife”, they may write a get
							and give it to her. Later they said, even if he were leaving for a sea
							voyage or for a caravan journey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even if he

							If a man had been thrown into a pit and cried out, “Whoever hears his

							wife”, his intention is merely to play with her. It once happened that
							a man in good health said, “Write a get for my wife”, and then went up
							on to a roof and fell and died, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said
							that the Sages said: if he had thrown himself down this is a get, but

							she cannot marry the husband’s brother. If he said, “This is your get

							neither from this one nor from that one. If she has taken anything from
							this one or that one, she must return it. The child from this one or

							she may find, nor what she makes with her hands, nor to invalidate her

							from marrying a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, from the eating of
							tithe; and if the daughter of a priest, from the eating of terumah.
							Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to

							If a man wrote a get with which to divorce his wife and then changed

							Rabbi Judah said: an unmarried man must not tend cattle, nor may two

							one should not teach his son a woman’s trade. Rabbi Meir says: one
							should always teach his son a clean and easy profession, and pray to
							Him to whom wealth and property belong. For a profession does not
							contain the potential for poverty and wealth, for poverty is not due to
							one’s profession nor is wealth due to the profession, but all depends
							on merit. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: have you ever seen a wild beast
							or a bird with a profession? Yet they are sustained without trouble.
							Now, were they not created only to serve me, while I was created to
							serve my master: surely then I should make a living without trouble!
							But my evil acts have done me in and withheld my livelihood. Abba
							Gurion a man of Sidon says in the name of Abba Guria: one should not
							teach his son to be a donkey-driver, camel-driver, wagon-driver,
							sailor, shepherd, or shopkeeper, because their profession is the
							profession of robbers. Rabbi Judah says in his name: most
							donkey-drivers are wicked, while most camel-drivers are worthy men; and
							most sailors are pious. The best of doctors are destined for Gehenna,
							and the worthiest of butchers is Amalek’s partner. Rabbi Nehorai says:
							I will abandon every profession in the world and I will not teach my
							son anything but Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world
							while the principal remains for him in the world to come. But all other
							professions are not so; for when a man comes to sickness or old age or
							suffering and cannot engage in his profession, he must die of
							starvation, whereas the Torah is not so, for it guards him from all
							evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. Of
							his youth what is said? “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
							their strength” (Isaiah 40:31). Of his old age what is said? “They
							shall still bring forth fruit in old age” (Psalms 92:15). And it is
							also said of our father Abraham, “And Abraham was old … And the Lord
							blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1). We find that Abraham
							our father observed the whole Torah before it was given, for it is
							said, “Because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My
							commandments, My statutes, and My laws” (Genesis 26:5).

							other vessels, one pays half damages. If it trampled upon a vessel and

							Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says, An attested danger is one that people
							have given testimony about three times. A harmless one is one that
							children can touch and it will not gore.

							“An ox which causes damage in the private domain of him that is

							in the public domain its owner pays only half damages. But if in the
							private domain of him that is injured, Rabbi Tarfon says, “He pays full
							damages.” The Sages says, “Half damages.” Rabbi Tarfon said to them:
							“Now, in a case in which the law dealt leniently with regards to
							damages caused by the foot and tooth in the public domain, in which
							case he is exempt, and stringently in the private domain of him that is
							injured to pay full damages, then since they have dealt stringently
							with damage caused by the horn in the public domain, ought we not deal
							more stringently with damage cause by the horn in the private domain of
							him that was injured, so that full damages be imposed.” They (the
							sages) said to him: “It is enough if the inferred law is as strict as
							that from which it is inferred: if for damages caused by the horn in
							the public domain half damages are imposed, so also for like damages in
							the private domain of him that was injured, half damages are imposed.
							He said to them: “I shall not derive the law in one case of damage
							caused by the horn from the law in another case of damage caused by the
							horn. Rather I will derive the law of damage caused by the horn from
							the law of damage caused by the foot. Now in a case in which the law
							dealt leniently with regards to damages caused by the foot or tooth in
							the public domain, they have dealt strictly with damage caused by the
							horn, ought we not deal more stringently with damage cause by the horn
							in the private domain. They (the sages) said to him: “It is enough if

							If a man brought his flock into a pen and shut it in properly and it

							was broken through at night, or bandits broke through it, and the flock
							came out and caused damage, he is not liable. If the bandits brought
							out the flock, the bandits are liable.  Section one teaches that if a
							person were to properly enclose his flock and nevertheless the flock
							were to escape, the person is exempt. Since he fulfilled his
							responsibility he is not liable for damages. However, if he didn’t
							enclose the flock properly he will be liable.  Section two can be
							explained as an exception to the rule in section one that if he didn’t
							enclose the flock properly he is liable. Section two teaches that if
							the flock broke out at night (i.e. they broke the enclosed part of the
							fence) or bandits broke the fence, the owner is exempt, even though he
							did not properly lock the fence. The owner is not liable since the
							animals broke out against his control, even though they could have gone
							out through the main gate, thereby making him liable. If, on the other
							hand, they were to have broken the fence during the day, and he didn’t
							lock it properly, he is liable. (There are other explanations to this
							section). The final clause of the mishnah says that if the bandits
							physically let out the flock, they are liable if it causes damage.

							it caused. How does he pay for the damage it caused? They assess what a
							seah’s space of ground in that field was worth before and what it is

							one brought the wood and then another brought fire, he that brought the

							fanned the flame is liable. If the wind fanned the flame, they are all
							exempt. If a man sent forth fire, and it consumed wood or stones or
							dust, he is liable, for it says: “When a fire breaks out and spreads to
							thorns so that the stacked corn is consumed, or the standing corn, or
							the field, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.” If
							it passed over a fence four cubits high, or over a public way, or over

							far may it spread and he will still be liable? Rabbi Eleazar ben
							Azariah says: “It is looked at as if it was in the middle of a kor’s

							slave fastened to it to the stack and a kid stood near by and they were
							burnt with it, he is not liable. The Sages agree with Rabbi Judah that

							ox or a sheep, for it is written, “If a man shall steal an ox or a
							sheep and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and

							If he stole an ox or a sheep according to the evidence of two
							witnesses, and slaughtered it or sold it according to the evidence of
							one witness or according to his own evidence, he makes twofold
							restitution, but not fourfold or fivefold restitution. If he stole an
							ox or a sheep and slaughtered it on the Sabbath, or stole it and
							slaughtered it for idolatrous use, or stole what was his father’s and
							his father died, and he afterward slaughtered or sold it, or if he
							stole it and then dedicated it, and afterward slaughtered it or sold
							it, he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold
							restitution. Rabbi Shimon says: “If they were Holy Things which must be
							replaced if damaged or lost he must make fourfold or fivefold
							restitution; but if they were Holy Things which need not be replaced,
							he is exempt.” 1. If a man stole an ox or a sheep and sold it on the
							Sabbath, 2. or stole it and sold it for idolatrous use 3. or stole it
							and slaughtered it on the Day of Atonement; 4. if he stole what was his
							father’s and slaughtered it or sold it, and afterward his father died;
							5. if he stole it and slaughtered it and then he dedicated it to the
							Temple 6. he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. 1. If he stole
							an ox or a sheep and slaughtered it on the Sabbath, 2. or stole it and
							slaughtered it for idolatrous use, 4. or stole what was his father’s
							and his father died, and he afterward slaughtered or sold it, 5. or if
							he stole it and then dedicated it, and afterward slaughtered it or sold
							it, 6. he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold
							restitution. In the cases mentioned in mishnah two the person is liable
							for fourfold and fivefold restitution and in mishnah four he is not.
							Using the line by line comparison we should be able to see why the law
							is different in each individual case. In case 1, if the person
							slaughtered the ox or sheep on the Sabbath he is obligated for the
							death penalty. Since one can only receive one punishment per crime, he
							is not fined additionally for having slaughtered the animal. If,
							however, he had only sold the animal, he would not be obligated for the
							death penalty and therefore he would owe the fine. The same is true for
							case 3. Selling an animal for idolatrous use is not a crime for which
							one would receive the death penalty, and therefore he is obligated for
							the fine. On the other hand, slaughtering for idolatrous use is a
							capital crime and therefore he receives a death penaly and not a fine.
							We learn in case 4 that if he stole his father’s animal and did not
							slaughter or sell it until after he dies he is not obligated for
							fourfold or fivefold restitution. Since at the time of the slaughtering
							or selling part of the animal was his as an inheritance he is not
							obligated. (We will see a similar law in the next mishnah). If,
							however, he had sold or slaughtered the animal before the death of his
							father, he would be obligated. Similarly in case 5 if he sold and
							slaughtered the animal after having dedicated it, he is selling or
							slaughtering an animal that is no longer really belongs to him. He is
							therefore not obligated for the fine. If, however, he slaughtered or
							sold the animal and then dedicated it, he will be obligated for the
							fine. Rabbi Shimon makes a clarification on this last law. The “Holy
							Things” to which he refers are animals dedicated to the Temple. There
							are two types of such dedications. If the owner says that “this animal
							is dedicated”, then he must bring this animal. If the animal gets lost
							or dies the owner is not obligated to bring another animal in its
							place. In such a case, if a thief should steal and slaughter or sell
							the animal he is not obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution.
							If, however, the owner dedicated the animal by saying “I dedicate an
							animal”, then he if the original animal is lost he must bring another.
							In such a case if the thief should slaughter or sell the animal he will
							be obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution. (This last law is
							difficult and is explained in other ways as well).

							sold it within the owner’s domain; or if he stole it and slaughtered or

							He who wounds his fellow is liable to compensate him on five counts:
							for injury, for pain, for healing, for loss of income and for
							indignity. ‘For injury’: How so? If he blinded his fellow’s eye, cut
							off his hand or broke his foot, his fellow is looked upon as if he was
							a slave to be sold in the market and they assess how much he was worth
							and how much he is worth. ‘For pain’? If he burned him with a spit or a
							nail, even though it was on his fingernail, a place where it leaves no
							wound, they estimate how much money such a man would be willing to take
							to suffer so. ‘Healing’? If he struck him he is liable to pay the cost
							of his healing. If sores arise on him on account of the blow, he is
							liable for the cost of their healing. If not on account of the blow, he
							is not liable. If the wound healed and then opened and healed and then
							opened, he is liable for the cost of the healing. If it healed
							completely, he is no longer liable to pay the cost of the healing.
							‘Loss of income’: He is looked upon as a watchman of a cucumber field,
							since he already gave him compensation for the loss of his hand or
							foot. ‘Indignity’: All is according to the status of the one that
							inflicts indignity and the status of the one that suffers indignity. If
							a man inflicted indignity on a naked man, or a blind man, or a sleeping
							man, he is still liable. If a man fell from the roof and caused injury
							and inflicted indignity, he is liable for the injury but not for the
							indignity, as it says, “And she puts forth her hand and grabs him by
							the private parts”, a man is liable only when he intended to inflict
							indignity.

							If a man boxed the ear of his fellow, he must pay him a sela (four.

							his hand, he must pay him 400 zuz. If he tore at his ear, plucked out
							his hair, spat at him and his spit touched him, or pulled his cloak
							from off him, or loosed a woman’s hair in the street, he must pay 400
							zuz. This is the general rule: all is in accordance with the person’s
							honor. Rabbi Akiva said: “Even the poor in Israel are regarded as free
							people who have lost their possessions, for they are the children of
							Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It once happened that a man unloosed a
							woman’s hair in the street and she came before Rabbi Akiva and he
							condemned him to pay her 400 zuz. He said, “Rabbi, give me time”. And
							he gave him time. He caught her standing at the entrance to her
							courtyard, and he broke a jug of one issar’s worth of oil in front of
							her. She unloosed her hair and scooped up the oil in her hand and laid
							her hand on her head. He had set up witnesses up against her and he
							came before Rabbi Akiva and said to him, “Rabbi, should I give one such
							as this 400 zuz? ” He answered, “You have said nothing.” If a man
							injures himself, even though he has no right to do so, is not liable.
							But others who injure him are liable. If a man cuts down his own
							saplings, even though he has no right to do so, is not liable. But, if
							others cut them down, they are liable.

							Which found objects belong to the finder and which ones must be
							proclaimed in the lost and found? These found objects belong to the
							finder: if a man found scattered fruit, scattered money, small sheaves
							in the public domain, cakes of figs, bakers’ loaves, strings of fish,
							pieces of meat, wool shearings as they come from the country of origin,
							stalks of flax and strips of purple wool, according to Rabbi Meir.
							Rabbi Judah says: “Anything which has in it something unusual, must be

							claims it”, which is to say until you inquire about your fellow, if he

							be sold, as it is said in the verse, Deut. 22:2: “And you shall return
							it to him”, See how you can return it to him. What shall be with the

							and spread it out for the clothing’s own good, but not for his own
							honor. If he found silver or copper vessels he must use them for their
							own good but not so as to wear them out. If he found vessels of gold or

							What counts as lost property? If he found an ass or a cow grazing on
							the path, this does not count as lost property. But if he found an ass
							with its trappings turned over, or a cow running in the vineyards, this
							is lost property. If he returned it and it escaped again, and he
							returned it and it escaped again, even four or five times, he is
							obligated to return it yet again, since it is stated (Deut. 22:1): “You
							shall surely return it to your brother”. If the finder lost time at
							work that was worth a sela (an amount of money), he may not say to the
							owner, “Give me a sela”. Rather the owner need only pay him the wages
							of an unemployed laborer. If there was a court of law in the that place
							the finder may stipulate before them for damages for time lost. If
							there was no court of law, before whom can he stipulate? His comes
							first.

							If he found an animal in a stable, he is not responsible for it even
							though the stable door was loose and unguarded. But if he found it in
							the public domain he is responsible for it. If it was in a cemetery he
							need not contract uncleanness because of it. If his father said to him,
							“Contract uncleanness”, or if he said to him, “Do not return it”, he
							may not listen to him. If he unloaded the ass fallen under its load and
							reloaded it and again unloaded it and reloaded it, even four or five
							times he is still obligated, for it is written, “You must surely raise
							it with him”. If the owner went and sat down and said, “Since the
							commandment is upon you, if you wish to unload, unload”, he is not
							obligated, for it is written “with him”. But if the owner was aged or
							sick, he is obligated. It is a commandment from the Torah to unload but
							not to reload. Rabbi Shimon says, “To reload as well.” Rabbi Yose the
							Galilean says, “If the beast was carrying more than its proper load he
							is not obligated to help unload it, for it is written, “under its
							load”, which is to say a load which it is able to endure.

							When a man leaves produce for his fellow, and his fellow returns it to

							kor. All is in proportion to the quantity and according to the time it
							is left. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said: “But what do the mice care about
							the quantity? Won’t they eat the same amount whether there is a lot or
							a little? Rather, he may exact a reduction from only one kor. Rabbi
							Judah says: “If the quantity was great he may not exact any reduction,

							of oil one log and a half for sediment and one log and a half for
							absorption. If the oil was refined he may not exact for sediment. If
							the jars were old he may not exact for absorption. Rabbi Judah says:

							Fraud is an overcharge of 4 pieces of silver out of 24 pieces of

							what time may he that is defrauded retract the sale? Until he has time
							to show his purchase to a merchant or to his kinsman. Rabbi Tarfon gave
							instruction in Lud: “Fraud is an overcharge of 8 pieces of silver to
							the seller, a third of the purchase price”, and the merchants of Lod
							celebrated. He said to them: “He may retract any time within a whole

							after twelve months he should accept it in return, but if he does not
							accept it the one who received it only has a cause for complaint
							against him. And it is permitted to use it for redeeming the Second
							Tithe without concern, for he who would not receive it is but only a

							Fraud is four pieces of silver. A claim is a minimum of two pieces of
							silver. An admission is a minimum of that which is worth a perutah.
							There are five rules involving that which is worth a perutah: An
							admission is a minimum of that which is worth a perutah. A woman can be
							betrothed with that which is worth a perutah. Someone who benefits a
							perutah’s worth from that which belongs to the sanctuary has committed
							sacrilege. One who finds that which is worth a perutah must proclaim it
							as a lost object. One who steals that which is worth a perutah from his
							fellow and swears falsely to him that he did not steal it, must go
							after him to return it even as far as Medea.
						-
					-
						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 2 - Bava Metzia: Perek 4: Mishnah 8

							There are five cases in which one must add a fifth:One who eats
							terumah, or the terumah taken from the tithe, or the terumah from a
							tithe taken from doubtfully tithed produce, or dough offering, or first
							fruits, must add a fifth to the value of the principle when he makes
							restitution. One that redeems the fruit of a fourth year plant, or his
							second tithe, must add a fifth. One that redeems that which he
							dedicated to the Temple must add a fifth. One that derives a perutah’s
							worth of benefit from that which belongs to the sanctuary must add a
							fifth when he makes restitution. One who steals that which is worth a
							perutah from his fellow must add a fifth when he makes restitution.

							These are the things to which the laws of fraud through overcharging do
							not apply: The sale of slaves, debt documents, land and what belongs to
							the Temple. They are not subject to twofold restitution, nor fourfold
							or fivefold restitution. An unpaid guardian does not take an oath on
							their account, that he did not damage them nor does a paid guardian
							make compensation if they are lost on his watch. Rabbi Shimon says:
							“Holy Things for which he is responsible, are subject to the laws of
							fraud through overcharging, and Holy Things for which he is not
							responsible are not subject to the laws of fraud through overcharging.”
							Rabbi Judah says: “Also one who sells a Torah scroll, and an animal or
							a pearl they are not subject to the laws of fraud through
							overcharging.” They (the Sages) said to him: “They only said these.”

							Just as the laws of fraud apply to buying and selling, so to do they
							apply to the spoken word. One may not say, “How much is this object? ,
							if he does not wish to buy it. If one had repented, another should not
							say to him, “Remember your earlier deeds”. If one descended from
							converts, another should not say to him, “Remember the deeds of your
							ancestors”. For it is said (Exodus 22:21), “And a stranger you shall

							Produce may not be mixed together with other produce, even new produce
							with new produce, and needless to say new with old. In truth they
							permitted sharp wine to be mixed with weak wine, since this improves
							the taste. Wine lees may not be mixed with wine, but the seller may
							give the buyer the lees that come from the same wine. One whose wine
							has been mixed with water may not sell it in a store unless he informs
							the buyer and not to a merchant even if he has informed him, since the
							merchant would buy it only to deceive with it. In a place where they
							are accustomed to put water in wine, they may do so.

							What is usury (neshech) and what is increase (tarbit)? It is usury
							(neshech) when a man lends a sela for five dinars, or two seahs of
							wheat for three, because he bites (noshech) off too much. And what is
							increase? When a man increases his gains by selling produce. How is
							this so? If one bought wheat at a golden dinars =25 silver dinars for a
							kor when such was the market price, and then wheat rose to thirty
							silver dinars per kor. If he said to him, “Give me my wheat since I
							would sell it and buy wine with the proceeds” and the other said, “Let

							One who lends money to his fellow may not dwell in his courtyard for
							free or rent it from him at a reduced rate, since that counts as usury.
							One may increase rent-charge not paid in advance but not purchase price
							not paid in advance. How so? If his fellow rented him his courtyard,
							and said to him, “If you pay me now the cost is 10 selas per year, but
							if you pay me on a monthly basis, the rent is one sela per month”, this
							is permitted. However, if he sold him his field, and said to him, “If
							you pay me now it is yours for 1,000 zuz, but if you pay me at the time
							of threshing it will be 1,200 zuz”, it is forbidden.

							over olives in a vat, or over the clay-balls of the potter, or over
							lime as soon as the limestone is sunk in the kiln. One may set a price
							for manure at any time of the year. Rabbi Yose says: “One may not set a
							price over manure unless the seller has manure on the dungheap.” But
							the Sages permit it. One may set the price at the cheapest rate that
							will be at the time of delivery. Rabbi Judah says: “Even if he didn’t
							set the price at the cheapest rate he may say, “Give me at the such a
							price or give me back my money.”

							A landowner may lend his tenants wheat to be repaid in wheat, if it is
							for planting but not if it is for food. For Rabban Gamaliel used to
							lend his tenants wheat to be repaid in wheat when it was for planting.
							And if he lent it when the price was high and it afterward fell, or
							when it was low and it afterward rose, he used to take wheat back at
							the lower rate, not because such was the rule but because he wanted to
							be strict upon himself.

							One should not say to his fellow, “Lend me a kor of wheat and I will
							repay you at the threshing time”, but he may say, “Lend it to me until
							my son comes”, or “until I find my key”. But Hillel used to forbid
							this. Moreover Hillel used to say, “A woman may not lend a loaf of
							bread to her neighbor unless she determines its value in money, lest
							wheat should rise in price and they are found to be engaging in usury.”

							weed”. All days of the dry season are accounted alike, and all days of
							the rainy season are accounted alike. One may not say to another, “Help
							me plow in the dry season and I will help you plow in the rainy
							season.” Rabban Gamaliel says: “There is interest that is paid in
							advance and interest that is paid afterward. How is this so? If a one
							intended to borrow from another and made him a present and said, “This
							is so that you will lend to me”, this is interest that is paid in
							advance. If one borrowed from another and repaid it to him, and then
							sent a present and said, “This is for your money of which you have not
							had use while it was with me”, this is interest that is paid afterward.
							Rabbi Shimon says: “There is interest paid in words: one may not say to
							his creditor, “Know that such and such a person has come form such and

							Those that guard gathered produce may eat from it because that is the

							not been neglectful in every case of loss or damage and be free of

							even one wolf is considered to be an unavoidable accident.” Two dogs do
							not count as an unavoidable accident. Yadua the Babylonian said in the
							name of Rabbi Meir says: “If two dogs came from one direction they do
							not count as an unavoidable accident, but if they came from two
							directions they count as an unavoidable accident. A bandit counts as an
							unavoidable accident. A lion or a bear or a leopard or a panther or a
							serpent counts as an unavoidable accident. When is this so? When they
							come of themselves. But if he took the flock to a place of wild animals
							or bandits they do not count as an unavoidable accident.

							If a beast died a natural death this counts as an unavoidable accident

							crag and it fell down and died, this does not count as an unavoidable
							accident. An unpaid guardian may make a stipulation that he will be
							exempt from taking an oath, and a borrower may make a stipulation that
							he will be exempt from making restitution, and a paid guardian and a
							hirer may make a stipulation that they will be exempt from taking an
							oath or from making restitution.

							If there was a house (the first story) and an upper room (the second
							story) belonging to two people, and the floor of the upper room broke
							and the owner of the house (the bottom story) did not want to fix it,
							the owner of the upper room may come down and dwell below, until the
							owner of the bottom story fixes the floor of the upper room. Rabbi Yose
							says: “He that dwells below should provide the beams and he that dwells
							above the plastering.

							the owner of the house (the bottom story) to rebuild it, and he did not
							want to rebuild it, the owner of the upper room may rebuild the house
							below and live in it until the other repays him what he has spent.
							Rabbi Judah says: “He would then after being reimbursed have been
							dwelling on his fellow’s property and he should therefore pay him rent.
							Rather the owner of the upper room should rebuild both the house below
							and the upper room and put a roof on the upper room, and live in the
							house below until the other repays him what he has spent.”

							domain and caused damage, the owner is not liable to make restitution.
							If a set time had been given to him to cut down the tree or pull down

							If one’s wall was near his fellow’s garden and it fell down and his

							owner of the garden) had accepted he (the owner of the wall) said to
							him, “Here is your expenditures and I will take back what is mine”,
							they do not listen to him. If one hired a laborer to help him in his
							work with chopped straw and stubble, and the laborer said to him, “Give
							me my wages”, and he said to him, “Take as your wages that with which
							you have labored”, they do not listen to him. If after the other (the

							The same is true with a garden: in a place where the custom is to build
							a fence, they can obligate him to do so. However, in a valley, where it
							is not customary to build a fence, they cannot obligate him to do so.
							But if he wants to build a fence he must gather into his own portion
							and build, and he puts a finishing on the outside of the wall.
							Therefore if the wall falls, the place and the stones belong to him. If
							they acted with each other’s consent, they should build the wall in the
							middle and put a finishing on both sides. Therefore if the wall falls,

							The legal period of possession in order to establish ownership for

							olive-presses, irrigated fields and slaves and anything which
							continually produces a yield is three complete years. The legal period
							of possession in order to establish ownership for a field irrigated by
							rain water is three years and they need not be completed. Rabbi
							Yishmael says: “Three months during the first year, and three months
							during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which
							makes eighteen months.” Rabbi Akiva says: “One month during the first
							year and one month during the last year and twelve months during the
							middle year, which makes fourteen months.” Rabbi Yishmael said: “When
							does this apply? With regards to a sown field, but with tree
							plantation, if he brought in his produce (grapes), collected the olives
							and gathered in his fig harvest, this counts as three years.”

							There are three regions with regards to possession: Judea, beyond the
							Jordan and the Galilee. If the owner was in Judea and another took
							possession of his property in the Galilee; Or if he was in the Galilee
							and another took possession of his property in Judea, such possession
							does not demonstrate ownership, until he is in the same region. Rabbi
							Judah said: “They have specified a period of three years so that if the
							owner was in Spain and another took possession of his property during
							one year, they could make it known to the owner during the next year
							and he could return in the third year.”

							An act of possession without which there is no claim on the ownership
							of the property is not valid possession to establish ownership. How is
							this so? If he said to him: “What are you doing on my property? And the
							other answered: “No one ever said anything to me”, this is not valid
							possession to establish ownership. If he said to him: “You sold it to
							me”, “You gave it to me as a gift”, “Your father sold it to me”, “Your
							father gave it to me as a gift”, this is valid possession to establish
							ownership. He who holds possession for three years due to inheritance
							from the previous owner, does not need to make a claim. Craftsmen,
							partners, sharecroppers and guardians cannot establish ownership
							through possession. A man cannot establish ownership through possession
							of his wife’s property, nor may a wife establish ownership through
							possession of her husband’s property, nor a father of his son’s
							property, nor a son of his father’s property. When is this so that one
							needs three years to establish ownership? When the person attempts to
							acquire the land through possession. But, when the property was given
							as a gift, or when brothers shared a piece of their inheritance, or
							when one claimed title by possession to the property of a convert who
							died without inheritors, then if the claimant has shut in, walled up or
							broken down anything, this counts as securing ownership through
							possession.

							If two testify that he has had the use of property during three years

							of restitution between them. If three brothers testify and another is

							What are usages which are effective in establishing title through

							oven or stoves or mill-stones, or reared fowl in a courtyard or put his
							manure in a courtyard, this is not effective in establishing title
							through possession. But if he built for his beast a partition ten
							hand-breadths high, so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for
							a mill-stone, or he brought fowl inside the house, or prepared for his
							manure a place three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high,

							A gutter spout cannot cause title through possession so that the spout

							through possession but a Tyrian ladder can. An Egyptian window cannot
							give title through possession but a Tyrian window can. What is an
							Egyptian window? Any through which a man’s head may not enter. Rabbi
							Judah says: “If it has a frame, even though a man’s head cannot enter
							through it, it can give title through possession.” A projection, if it
							extends a handbreadth or more can give title through possession, and
							the other into whose premises it projects can protest against it. But
							if it is less than a handbreadth it cannot give title through
							possession and the other cannot protest against it.

							If a man bought two trees in his fellow’s field, he has not bought the

							When they grow (branches), he (the seller) may not trim them. What

							from the roots belongs to the seller. And if they die, the ground is
							not his to replant new trees. If he bought three trees, he has bought
							the ground between them. When they grow he may trim them, And what
							comes up whether from the stem or from the roots belongs to him (the
							buyer). And if they die the ground is his.

							If a man sold produce to his fellow and the buyer drew it towards him
							but did not measure it, the buyer has acquired the produce. If the
							seller had measured it but the buyer did not draw it towards him, he
							has not acquired the produce. If the buyer is clever he will rent the
							place in which the produce is located. If a man bought flax from his
							fellow he has not acquired it until he has moved it from one place to
							another. If it was still attached to the ground, and he plucked any
							small quantity of it, he has acquired possession.

							If a man sold wine or oil to his fellow, and its value rose or fell, if

							the seller, and he may refuse to sell except at the higher price. But
							if the price rose or fell after the measure was filled up, it belongs
							to the buyer and he may refuse to buy except at the lower price. If
							there was a middleman between them, and the jar broke, it is broken to
							the loss of the middleman. After emptying the measure the seller must
							let three more drops drip for the buyer. If he then turned the measure
							over and drained it off, what flows out belongs to the seller. The
							shopkeeper is not obligated to let three more drops drip. Rabbi Judah
							says: “Only on the eve of Shabbath as it becomes dark is he exempt.”

							until Shavuoth. If he said it is old wine, it must be from last year’s.
							If he said it is vintage old wine, it must be from the year before

							less or more”, even if he gave the buyer a quarter-kab’s space less in
							every seah’s space, or a quarter kab’s space more in every seah’s
							space, it becomes his; if the error was more than this, a reckoning
							must be made. What does he (the buyer) give him back? Its value in
							money; but if the seller wants, he gives him back the land. And why did
							they say that he could give back its value in money? To strengthen the
							power of the seller, for if, in a field containing a kor’s space there
							would still have remained to him nine kab’s space, or, in a garden, a

							This is the order of inheritance: “If a man dies without leaving a son,

							offspring precede the brothers.’ Brothers precede the father’s brothers
							and the brothers’ offspring precede the father’s brothers. This is the

							The daughters of Zelophehad took three portions of the inheritance (of

							The son and the daughter are alike concerning inheritance, save that

							If a man says, “So and so, my firstborn son, shall not receive a double
							portion”, or “So and so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers”,
							he has said nothing, for he has made a condition contrary to what is
							written in the Torah. If a man apportioned his property to his sons by
							word of mouth, and gave much to one and little to another, or made them
							equal to the firstborn, his words are valid. But if he had said that it
							should be so “by inheritance”, he has said nothing. If he had written
							down, whether at the beginning or in the middle or at the end of his
							will that it should be as a gift, his words are valid. If a man said,
							“So and so a man shall inherit from me” and he has a daughter; or “My
							daughter shall inherit from me”, and he has a son, he has said nothing,
							for he has made a condition contrary to what is written in the Torah.
							Rabbi Johanan ben Baroka says: “If he said that so and so shall inherit
							from me of one that was qualified to inherit from him, his words are
							valid, but if of one that was not qualified to inherit from him his
							words do not remain valid.” If a man wrote away his property to others
							and passed over his sons, what he has done is done, but the Sages are
							not comfortable with it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: “If has sons
							did not behave properly, it should be counted to his credit.”

							If a man said, “This is my son”, he is believed. If he said, “This is

							portion. If he died the property returns to its place. If he inherited
							property from elsewhere the other’s brothers inherit it together with
							him. If a man died and a testament was found bound to his thigh, this
							counts as nothing. But if he had delivered it and through it granted
							title to another, whether of his heirs or of those who are not his
							heirs, his words are valid.

							If a man writes over his property to his son, he must write, “From
							today and after my death”, according to Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says,
							“He need not do so.” If a man writes over his property to his son to be
							his after his death, the father cannot sell it since it is written over
							to the son, and the son cannot sell it since it is in the possession of
							the father. If his father sold the property, it is sold only until he
							dies; if the son sold the property, the buyer has no claim until the
							father dies. The father harvests the crops and gives them to whomever
							he wishes, and what he has left harvested belongs to all his heirs. If
							he left elder sons and younger sons, the elder sons may not take care
							of themselves from the estate at the expense of the younger sons, nor
							may the younger sons claim maintenance at the cost of the elder sons,
							rather they all share alike. If the elder sons married at the expense
							of the estate so too the younger sons may marry at the expense of the
							estate. If the younger sons said, “We will marry in the way you
							married”, they do not listen to them, for what their father gave them,
							he has given.

							he said, “If my wife shall bear a female she shall be given 200 zuz”,
							and she had a female, she receives 200 zuz. If he said, “If may wife
							shall bear a male he shall be given 100 zuz and if a female 200 zuz”
							and she had a male and a female, the male receives 100 zuz and the
							female 200 zuz. If she had one of doubtful gender, he does not take.

							witnesses.” If a man had paid part of his debt, Rabbi Judah says: “He
							should exchange the debt document for a new one.” Rabbi Yose says: “He
							should write a receipt.” Rabbi Judah said: “It turns out that this one
							(the debtor) will have to guard his receipt from mice.” Rabbi Yose said
							to him: “That’s good for him, as long as the rights of the other (the

							If there were two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father
							left them a bath house or an olive press, if the father had made them
							for hire, the profit is split equally. But if he made them for his own
							use alone, the rich brother may say to the poor brother, “Buy for
							yourself slaves and they can wash in the bath house” or “Buy for
							yourself olives and prepare them in the olive press.” If there were two
							in the same town, and one’s name was Joseph the son of Shimon and
							other’s name was Joseph the son of Shimon, neither can bring forth a
							debt document on the other, and another person cannot bring forth a
							debt document against them. And if some person finds amongst his
							documents a document that states, “The debt document of Joseph ben
							Shimon is paid”, both of their debt documents are paid. What should
							they do? They should write their names to the third generation. And if
							the names are the same through the third generation, they should give
							themselves a sign. And if their signs are the same, they should write
							“Cohen”. If a man said to his son, “One of my debt documents is paid
							and I do not know which one”, then all are deemed to be paid. If two
							documents were found amongst his documents written to the same debtor,
							then the large one is paid and the small one is not paid. If a man lent
							money to his fellow on a guarantor’s security, he may not exact payment
							from the guarantor. But if he had said, “On the condition that I may
							exact payment from whom I wish”, then he may exact payment from the
							guarantor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: “If the borrower had
							property, in neither case can he exact payment from the guarantor.”
							Moreover, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel used to say: “If a man was a
							guarantor for a woman’s ketubah and her husband divorced her, the
							husband must vow to derive no further benefit from her, lest he make a
							conspiracy against the property of the guarantor and take his wife back
							again.”

							If a man lent his fellow money by using a document, he may recover the
							debt from mortgaged property. But if he had lent only before witnesses
							(and not through a document), he may recover the debt only from
							unmortgaged property. If the creditor brought forth a loan document
							upon which appeared his (the debtor’s) signature as evidence that he
							was indebted to him, the creditor may recover the debt only from
							unmortgaged property. If a man signed as a guarantor after the
							signatures of witnesses, the creditor may recover the debt only from
							the guarantor’s unmortgaged property. Such a case came before Rabbi
							Yishmael and he said, “He may recover only from unmortgaged property”.
							Ben Nanos said to him: “He may recover the debt neither from mortgaged
							nor unmortgaged property.” He said to him: “Why? ” He answered, “If a
							man seized a debtor by the throat in the street and his fellow found
							him and said ‘Leave him alone (and I will pay’, he is not liable, since
							not through trust in him did the creditor lend the debtor money.”
							Rather which type of guarantor is liable? If a man said, “Lend him
							money and I will pay thee”, he is liable, for he lent him the money
							through his trust in the guarantor. And Rabbi Yishmael said, “He who
							wants to be wise let him occupy himself with cases dealing with
							monetary matters, for there is no greater branch of Torah than this;
							for they are like a welling fountain; and he who wishes to occupy
							himself with laws concerning monetary matters, let him serve as a pupil
							of Shimon ben Nanos.

							Both non-capital and capital cases require examination and inquiry of
							the witnesses, as it says, “You shall have one manner of law” (Lev.
							24:22). How do non-capital cases differ from capital cases? Non-capital
							cases are decided by three and capital cases by twenty three.
							Non-capital cases may begin either with reasons for acquittal or for
							conviction; capital cases begin with reasons for acquittal and do not
							begin with reasons for conviction. In non-capital cases they may reach
							a verdict of either acquittal or conviction by the decision of a
							majority of one; in capital cases they may reach an acquittal by the
							majority of one but a verdict of conviction only by the decision of a
							majority of two. In non-capital cases they may reverse a verdict either
							from conviction to acquittal or from acquittal to conviction; in
							capital cases they may reverse a verdict from conviction to acquittal
							but not from acquittal to conviction. In non-capital cases all may
							argue either in favor of conviction or of acquittal; in capital cases
							all may argue in favor of acquittal but not all may argue in favor of
							conviction. In non-capital cases he that had argued in favor of
							conviction may afterward argue in favor of acquittal, or he that had
							argued in favor of acquittal may afterward argue in favor of
							conviction; in capital cases he that had argued in favor of conviction
							may afterward argue in favor of acquittal but he that had argued in
							favor of acquittal cannot afterward argue in favor of conviction. In
							non-capital cases they hold the trial during the daytime and the
							verdict may be reached during the night; in capital cases they hold the
							trial during the daytime and the verdict also must be reached during
							the daytime. In non-capital cases the verdict, whether of acquittal or
							of conviction, may be reached the same day; in capital cases a verdict
							of acquittal may be reached on the same day, but a verdict of
							conviction not until the following day. Therefore trials may not be
							held on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival.

							They used to examine witnesses with seven inquiries: In what week of

							day? In what hour? In what place? Rabbi Yose says: They only asked: On

							The more a judge examines the evidence the more he is deserving of

							What is the difference between inquiries and examinations? With regards

							evidence becomes invalid. But if to one of the examinations one
							answered, “I do not know”, or even if they both answered, “We do not
							know”, their evidence remains valid. Yet if they contradict each other,
							whether during the inquiries or examinations, their evidence becomes
							invalid.

							If one said, “On the second of the month”, and the other said, “On the

							month was intercalated and the other may not have known that the month
							was intercalated. If one said, “On the third” and the other said, “On
							the fifth”, their evidence is invalid. If one said, “At the second
							hour”, and the other said, “At the third”, their evidence remains
							valid. If one said, “At the third hour”, and the other said, “At the
							fifth”, their evidence becomes invalid. Rabbi Judah says: “It remains
							valid. But if one said, ‘At the fifth hour’ and one said ‘At the
							seventh’, their evidence becomes invalid, since at the fifth hour the
							sun is in the east and at the seventh it is in the west.

							in favor of acquittal. If one of the witnesses said, “I have something
							to argue in favor of his acquittal”, or if one of the disciples said,
							“I have something to argue in favor of his conviction”, they silence
							him. If one of the disciples said, “I have something to argue in favor
							of his acquittal”, they bring him up and set him among them and he does
							not come down from there all day. If there is anything of substance in
							his words they listen to him. Even if the accused said, “I have

							When the trial is completed he the condemned is led forth to be stoned.
							The place of stoning was outside of the court, as it is says, “Bring
							out him that has cursed” (Lev. 24:14). A man was stationed at the door
							of the court with the handkerchiefs in his hand, and a man on a horse
							was stationed at a distance yet within sight of him. If one says, ‘I
							have something further to state in his favor’, he the signaler waves
							the handkerchief, and the man on the horse runs and stops them. And
							even if he the convict himself says, ‘I have something to plead in my
							own favor’, he is brought back, even four or five times, providing,
							however, that there is substance in his assertion. If then they find
							him innocent, they discharge him. But if not, he goes forth to be
							stoned, and a herald precedes him crying: so and so, the son of so and
							so, is going forth to be stoned because he committed such and such an
							offense, and so and so are his witnesses. Whoever knows anything in his

							When he is about ten cubits away from the place of stoning, they say to
							him, ‘confess’, for such is the practice of all who are executed, that
							they first confess, for he who confesses has a portion in the world to
							come. For so we find in the case of Achan, that Joshua said to him, “My
							son, pay honor to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession to
							him. Tell me what you have done, do not hold anything back from me.”
							And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true, I have sinned against
							the Lord the God of Israel, and this is what I have done” (Josh.
							7:19-20). And how do we know that his confessions made atonement for
							him? As it says, “And Joshua said, “What calamity have you brought upon
							us! The Lord will bring calamity upon you this day” (Josh. 7:35),
							meaning this day you are a calamity, but you are not to be a calamity
							in the next world. And if he does not know how to confess, they say to
							him, “Say, may my death be an expiation for all my sins.” Rabbi Judah
							said: “If he knows that he is a victim of false evidence, he can say:
							may my death be an expiation for all my sins but this.” They the sages
							said to him: “If so, everyone will speak likewise in order to clear
							himself.”

							When he is about four cubits distant from the place of stoning, he is
							stripped of his clothing. A man is covered in front and a woman both in
							front and behind, according to Rabbi Judah. But the Sages say: “A man
							is to be stoned naked and a woman is not to be stoned naked.

							The place of stoning was twice a man's height. One of the witnesses
							pushed him by the hips, so that he was overturned on his heart. He was
							then turned on his back. If that caused his death, he had fulfilled his
							duty; but if not, the second witness took a stone and threw it on his
							chest. If he died thereby, he had done his duty; but if not, he the
							criminal was stoned by all Israel, for it is says: “The hand of the
							witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards
							the hand of all the people” (Deut. 17:7). All who are stoned are
							afterwards hanged, according to Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: “Only
							the blasphemer and the idolater are hanged.” A man is hanged with his
							face towards the spectators, but a woman with her face towards the
							gallows, according to Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: a man is
							hanged, but not a woman. Rabbi Eliezer said to them: “But did not
							Shimon ben Shetah hang women at ashkelon? ” They said: “On that
							occasion he hanged eighty women, even though two must not be tried on
							the same day. How is he hanged? The post is sunk into the ground with a
							cross- piece branching off at the top and he brings his hands together
							one over the other and hangs him up thereby. R. Jose said: the post is
							leaned against the wall, and he hangs him up the way butchers do. He is
							immediately let down. If he is left hanging over night, a negative
							command is thereby transgressed, for it says, “You shall not let his
							corpse remain all night upon the tree, but you must bury him the same
							day because a hanged body is a curse against god” (Deut. 21:23). As if
							to say why was he hanged? because he cursed the name of god; and so the
							name of Heaven God is profaned.

							R. Meir said: “When man suffers, what expression does the shechinah
							(God’s presence) use? “My head is too light (a euphemism for heavy) for
							me, my arm is too light (a euphemism for heavy) for me.” If god is so
							grieved over the blood of the wicked that is shed, how much more so
							over the blood of the righteous! And not only of this one a criminal
							did the sages not to leave him overnight but whosoever lets his dead
							lie over night transgresses a negative commandment. If he kept him over
							night for the sake of his honor, to procure for him a coffin or a
							shroud, he does not transgress. And they did not bury him the executed
							person in his ancestral tomb, but two burial places were prepared by
							the court, one for those who were decapitated or strangled, and the
							other for those who were stoned or burned.

							Four deaths have been entrusted to the court: stoning, burning, slaying
							by the sword and strangulation. R. Simeon says: “burning, stoning,

							The manner in which burning is executed is as follows: They would lower
							him into dung up to his armpits, then a hard cloth was placed within a
							soft one, wound round his neck, and the two loose ends pulled in
							opposite directions, forcing him to open his mouth. A wick was then
							lit, and thrown into his mouth, so that it descended into his body and
							burned his bowels. R. Judah says: “Should he have died at their hands
							being strangled by the bandage before the wick was thrown into his
							mouth, they would not have fulfilled the requirements of execution by
							fire. Rather his mouth was forced open with pincers against his wish,
							the wick lit and thrown into his mouth, so that it descended into his
							body and burned his bowels. Rabbi Eleazar ben Zadok said: “It once
							happened that a priest's daughter committed adultery, whereupon bundles
							of sticks were placed around her and she was burnt. The Sages said to
							him: “That was because the court at that time was not well learned in
							law.

							Slaying by the sword was performed thus: they would cut off his head by
							the sword, as is done by the civil authorities. R. Judah says: “This is
							a disgrace! Rather his head was laid on a block and severed with an
							axe. They said to him: “No death is more disgraceful than this.”
							Strangulation was performed thus: the condemned man was lowered into
							dung up to his armpits, then a hard cloth was placed within a soft one,
							wound round his neck, and the two ends pulled in opposite directions
							until he was dead.

							The following are stoned:He who has sexual relations with his mother,
							with his father's wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a male; with a
							beast; a woman who commits bestiality with a beast; a blasphemer; an
							idolater; one who gives of his seed to molech; a necromancer or a
							wizard; one who desecrates the Sabbath; he who curses his father or
							mother; he who commits adultery with a betrothed woman; one who incites
							individuals to idolatry; one who seduces a whole town to idolatry; a
							sorcerer; and a wayward and rebellious son. He who has sexual relations
							with his mother incurs a penalty in respect of her both as his mother
							and as his father's wife. R. Judah says: “He is liable in respect of
							her as his mother only.” He who has sexual relations with his father's
							wife incurs a penalty in respect of her both as his father's wife, and
							as a married woman, both during his father's lifetime and after his
							death, whether she was widowed from betrothal or from marriage. He who
							has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law incurs a penalty in
							respect of her both as his daughter-in-law and as a married woman, both
							during his son's lifetime and after his death, whether she was widowed
							from betrothal or from marriage. He who has sexual relations with a
							male or a beast, and a woman that commits bestiality: if the man has
							sinned, how has the animal sinned? But because the human was enticed to
							sin by the animal, therefore scripture ordered that it should be
							stoned. Another reason is that the animal should not pass through the
							market, and people say, this is the animal on account of which so and
							so was stoned.

							The blasphemer is punished only if he utters the divine name. Rabbi
							Joshua b. Korcha said: “The whole day of the trial the witnesses are
							examined by means of a substitute for the divine name:, ‘may Yose smite
							Yose.” When the trial was finished, the accused was not executed on
							this evidence, but all persons were removed from court, and the chief
							witness was told, ‘State literally what you heard.’ Thereupon he did
							so, using the divine name. The judges then arose and tore their
							garments, which were not to be resewn. The second witness stated: “I
							too have heard thus” but not uttering the divine name, and the third
							says: “I too heard thus.”

							He who engages in idol-worship is executed. This includes the one
							whoserves it, sacrifices, offers incense, makes libations, bows to it,
							accepts it as a god, or says to it, “You are my god.” But he who
							embraces, kisses it, sweeps or sprinkles the ground before it, washes
							it, anoints it, clothes it, or puts shoes on it, he transgresses a
							negative commandment but is not executed. He who vows or swears by its
							name, violates a negative commandment. He who uncovers himself before
							Baal-Peor is guilty and is to be stoned for this is how it is
							worshipped. He who casts a stone on Merculis is guilty and is to be
							stoned for this is how it is worshipped.

							He who gives of his seed to Molech is not liable unless he delivers it

							Molech but did not cause it to pass through the fire, or he caused it
							to pass through fire but did not give it to Molech, he incurs no
							penalty, unless he does both. A Ba'al Ob is the pithom who speaks from
							his armpit. The Yidde'oni is one who speaks from his mouth. These two
							are stoned; while he who inquires of them transgresses a formal

							One who incites individuals to idolatry -- this refers to an ordinary
							person who incites an individual who said, “There is an idol in such
							and such a place; it eats thus, it drinks thus, it does good to those
							who worship it and harm to those who do not.” For all who are liable
							for the death penalty according to the Torah no witnesses are hidden to
							entrap them, excepting for this one. If he said these things to two,
							they themselves are witnesses against him, and he is brought to court
							and stoned. But if he said these things to one, he should reply, “I
							have friends who wish to do so likewise come and propose it to them
							too.” But if he was cunning and declined to speak before them,
							witnesses are hidden behind a partition, while he who was incited says
							to him, make your proposal to me now in private. When the inciter says
							to him (repeats to him what he had already said), the other replies,
							“How can we abandon our God in heaven to go and serve wood and stones?
							” Should he retract, it is well. But if he answers, “It is our duty to
							worship idols, and is seemly for us”, then the witnesses stationed
							behind the partition take him to court, and have him stoned. He who
							incites individuals to idolatry is one who is one who says, “I will
							worship it”, or, “I will go and worship”, or, “let us go and worship”;
							or, “I will sacrifice to it”, “I will go and sacrifice”, “let us go and
							sacrifice”; “I will burn incense, “I will go and burn incense”; “let us
							go and burn incense”; or “I will make libations to it”, “I will go and
							make libations to it”, “let us go and make libations”; “I will
							prostrate myself before it”, “I will go and prostrate myself”, “let us
							go and prostrate ourselves”. One who seduces a whole town to idolatry
							is one who says, “Let us go and serve idols”.

							A wayward and rebellious son: at what age does he become liable to be
							stoned? From the time that he produces two hairs until the beard is
							full by which is meant the hair of the genitals, not that of the face,
							but the Sages used euphemisms , for it says, “If a man has a son”

							When does he become liable to be stoned? Once he has eaten a tartemar
							of meat and drunk half a log of wine. Rabbi Yose said: “A maneh of meat
							and a log of wine. If he ate it in a company celebrating a religious
							act; or at a gathering for the purpose of intercalating the month; if
							he ate the second tithe in Jerusalem; if he ate the carrion or terefoth
							(meat that was not slaughtered in a kosher fashion), abominable and
							creeping things, or untithed produce, or the first tithe from which
							terumah had not been separated, or unredeemed second tithe, or
							unredeemed sacred food; if his eating involved a religious act or a
							transgression; if he ate any food but did not eat meat or drank any
							drink but did not drink wine, he does not become a ‘stubborn and
							rebellious son, unless he eats meat and drinks wine, for it is written,
							“This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
							he is a glutton and a drunkard” (Deut. 21:20). Although there is no
							clear proof for this, there is at least a hint, as it is says, “Do not
							be among wine drinkers, among gluttonous meat eaters of flesh (Proverbs
							23:20).

							If he stole from his father and ate it on his father’s property, or of

							If his father wants to have him punished, but not his mother; or his
							father does not want to have him punished but his mother does, he is
							not treated as a ‘wayward a rebellious son’, unless they both desire
							it. Rabbi Judah said: “If his mother is not fit for his father, he does
							not become a ‘wayward and rebellious son”. If one of them his father or
							his mother had a hand cut off, or was lame, mute, blind or deaf, he
							cannot become a “wayward and rebellious son”, because it says “his
							father and mother shall take hold of him” (Deut. 21:19) not those with
							a hand cut off; “and bring him out”, not lame parents; “and they shall
							say”, and not mute parents; “this our son”, and not blind parents; “he
							will not obey our voice” (Deut. 21:20), and not deaf parents. He is
							warned in the presence of three and beaten. If he transgresses again
							after this, he is tried by a court of twenty three. He cannot be
							sentenced to stoning unless the first three are present, because it
							says, “this our son” (Deut. 21:20), implying, this one who was whipped
							in your presence. If he the rebellious son fled before his trial was
							completed, and then his pubic hair grew in fully, he is free. But if he
							fled after his trial was completed, and then his pubic hair grew in
							fully, he remains liable.

							The following are burnt: he who has sexual relations with a woman and

							own daughter, his daughter’s daughter, his son's daughter, his wife's
							daughter and the daughter of her daughter or son, his mother-in-law,
							her mother, and his father-in-law's mother. The following are
							decapitated: a murderer, and the inhabitants of a city subverted into
							worshipping idols. A murderer who slew his fellow with a stone or iron,
							or kept him down under water or in fire, so that he could not get out
							of there, is executed. If he pushed him into water or fire, but he
							could get out of there , yet he died, he is not liable for the death
							penalty. If he set a dog or a snake against him and they killed him, he
							is free from death. If he caused a snake to bite him, Rabbi Judah ruled

							If a man struck his fellow, whether with a stone or with his fist, and
							they the experts declared that he would die, but then its effect

							burning, Rabbi Shimon said: they are stoned, because burning is

							Rabbi Shimon said to them: “If burning was not severer, it would not be

							The following are strangled: One who strikes his father or mother; One
							who kidnaps a Jew; An elder who rebels against the ruling of the court;
							A false prophet; One who prophesies in the name of an idol; One who
							commits adultery; Witnesses who testified falsely to the adultery of a
							priest’s daughter, and the one who has had sexual relations with her.
							The one who strikes his father or his mother is liable only if he
							wounds them. In this respect, cursing is more stringent than striking,
							for one who curses his/her parents after death is liable, while one who
							strikes them after death is not. One who kidnaps a Jew is not liable
							unless he brings him onto his own property. Rabbi Judah said: “Until he
							brings him onto his own property and puts him to service, as it says,
							“If a man is found to have kidnapped a fellow Israelite, enslaving him
							or selling him” (Deut. 24:7). If he kidnaps his own son. Rabbi Ishmael
							the son of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka declares him liable, but the Sages
							exempt him. If he kidnapped one who was half a slave and half free,
							Rabbi Judah declares him liable, but the Sages exempt him.

							An elder rebelling against the ruling of the court is strangled, for it
							says, “If there arise a matter too hard for you for judgement …you
							shall promptly repair to the place that the Lord your God will have
							chosen, and appear before the levitical priests, or the magistrate in
							charge at the time, and present your problem. When they have announced
							to you the verdict in the case, you shall carry out the verdict that is
							announced to you from that place that the Lord chose, observing
							scrupulously all their instructions to you. You shall act in accordance
							with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you; you
							must not deviate from the verdict that they announce to you either to
							the right or to the left. Should a man act presumptuously and disregard
							the priest charged with serving there the Lord your God, or the
							magistrate, that man shall die” (Deut. 17:8-13, JPS translation). Three
							courts of law were there, one situated at the entrance to the Temple
							mount, another at the door of the Temple court, and the third in the
							Chamber of Hewn Stone. They first went to the court which is at the
							entrance to the Temple mount, and he the rebellious elder stated, “Thus
							have I expounded and thus have my colleagues expounded; thus have I
							taught, and thus have my colleagues taught.” If this first court had
							heard a ruling on the matter, they state it. If not, they go to the
							second court which is at the entrance of the Temple court, and he
							declares, “Thus have I expounded and thus have my colleagues expounded;
							thus have I taught, and thus have my colleagues taught.” If this second
							court had heard a ruling on the matter they state it; if not, they all
							proceed to the great court of the Chamber of Hewn Stone from whence
							instruction issued to all Israel, for it says, you shall carry out the
							verdict that is announced to you from that place that the Lord chose
							(Deut. 17:10). If he returned to his town and taught again as he did
							before, he is not liable. But if he gave a practical decision, he is
							guilty, for it says, “Should a man act presumptuously” (Deut. 17:12) he
							is liable only for a practical ruling. But if a disciple gave a
							practical decision opposed to the court, he is exempt: thus his
							stringency is his leniency.

							There is greater stringency in respect to the teachings of the scribes
							than in respect to the torah: thus, if a rebellious elder says, there
							is no commandment of tefillin, so that a biblical law may be
							transgressed, he is exempt. But if he rules that the tefillin must
							contain five compartments, thus adding to the words of the scribes, he
							is liable.

							He the rebellious elder was executed neither by his local court nor by
							the court at Yavneh, but rather was taken to the great court in
							Jerusalem and kept there until the next festival and executed on the
							festival, for it says, “And all the people shall hear and fear, and do
							no more presumptuously” (Deut. 17:13), according to the words of Rabbi
							Akiba. Rabbi Judah says: “His judgment must not be delayed, but he is
							executed immediately, and proclamations are written and sent by
							messengers to all places, “So and so has been sentenced to death at the
							court.”

							‘A false prophet’; he who prophesies what he has not heard, or what was

							says, “And if anybody fails to heed the words he speaks in my name I
							Myself will call him to account (Deut. 18:19).

							“He who prophesies in the name of an idol”: this is one who says, “Thus

							unclean, unclean, or the clean, clean. “One who has sexual relations
							with a married woman” after her entry into her husband’s home for
							marriage, though she did not have sexual relations with her husband,
							the one who has relations with her is strangled. “Witnesses who
							testified falsely to the adultery of a priest’s daughter, and the one
							who has had sexual relations with her”, for all false witnesses are led
							forth to meet the same death which they sought to impose, save
							witnesses who testified falsely to the adultery of a priest’s daughter,
							and the one who has had sexual relations with her.

							How do witnesses become liable to punishment as perjurers? If they say:
							“We testify that so and so a priest is a son of a woman who had
							formerly been divorced or a haluzah,” it is not said that each witness
							should himself be as if he was born of a divorcee or a haluzah; rather
							he receives forty lashes. If they say: “We testify that so and so is
							guilty of a crime entailing exile”, it is not said that each witness
							should himself be exiled; rather he receives forty lashes. If they say:
							“We testify that so and so divorced his wife and has not paid her
							kethubah” seeing that either today or tomorrow he the husband will pay
							her kethubah, the assessment should be made how much a man will be
							willing to pay now for the ownership of her kethubah, on the condition
							that if she should be widowed or divorced he will take it over but if
							she should die, her husband will inherit her estate including the
							kethubah. If they say: “We testify that so and so owes his friend one
							thousand zuz on the condition that he will pay him within thirty days”,
							while the debtor says “ten years”, the assessment should be made how
							much a man is willing to pay for the use of a thousand zuz, whether he
							pays them in thirty days or ten years.

						-
							If they say: “We testify that so and so owes his friend two hundred
							zuz”, and they are found to be perjurers, they are flogged and ordered
							to make restitution, because the count which brings upon them the
							flogging is not the count that brings upon them the necessity to make
							restitution, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say:
							“Anyone who makes restitution is not flogged.”
						-

						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 5 - Makkot: Perek 1: Mishnah 3

							If they say: “We testify that so and so is liable to a flogging of
							forty lashes, and they are found to be perjurers, they receive eighty
							lashes, because of, “You shall not bear false witness against your
							neighbor” (Exodus 20:13) and “You shall do to him as he schemed to do
							to his fellow” (Deuternomy 19:19), these are the words of Rabbi Meir.
							But the sages say, “They receive only forty lashes.” Monetary
							impositions are shared among the offenders, but the lashes are not
							shared among the offenders. How so? If they testified that he owed his
							friend one hundred zuz, and they were found to be perjurers, they
							divide the corresponding damages proportionately between them. But if
							they testified that he was liable to a flogging of forty lashes and
							were found to be perjurers, each one receives forty lashes.

						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 5 - Makkot: Perek 1: Mishnah 4

							Witnesses are not condemned as perjurers until they themselves are
							incriminated; How so? If they said: “We testify that so and so killed a
							person” and others said to them: “How could you testify to that, as
							that murdered person or that alleged murderer was with us on that very
							day, at such and such a place? ” then the witnesses are not condemned
							as perjurers. But, if these other witnesses said: “How could you
							testify to that, as on that very day, you were with us at such and such
							a place? ’ then the former are condemned as perjurers, and are executed
							by their the other witnesses word.

							If other witnesses came, and they charged them with perjury: then again
							others came, and they again charged them with perjury, even a hundred,
							they are all to be executed. Rabbi Judah says: “This is a conspiracy
							and the first set alone is to be executed.”

						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 5 - Makkot: Perek 1: Mishnah 6

							Perjuring witnesses are not to be put to death until after the end of
							the trial. Because the Sadducees say: “Perjurers were put to death only
							after the accused had actually been executed, as it says, “ A life for
							a life” (Deuteronomy 19:21). The Pharisaic Sages said to them: “But has
							not it already been said “You shall do to him as he schemed to do to
							his fellow” (Deuteronomy 19:19) which implies when his brother is still
							alive? If so, why does it say “A life for life”? For it might have been
							that perjurers are liable to be put to death from the moment their
							testimony had been taken, therefore the Torah states “A life for a
							life” that is to say that they are not executed until after the
							termination of the trial.

							“A person shall be put to death only on the testimony of two witnesses
							or three witnesses” (Deuteronomy 17:6).If the testimony is sufficiently
							established by two witnesses, why does Scripture further specify three?
							This is to compare two to three: just as three are competent to
							incriminate two as perjurers, so are two competent to incriminate three
							as perjurers. How do we know that two or three can even incriminate a
							hundred? The Torah states “witnesses”. Rabbi Shimon says: “Just as two
							witnesses are not put to death until both have been incriminated as
							perjurers, so three are not put to death until all three have been
							incriminated as perjurers. How do we know that two or three can even
							incriminate a hundred? The Torah states “witnesses”. Rabbi Akiba says:
							“The third witness was only mentioned in order to be stringent upon him
							and make his judgement the same as the other two. And if Scripture thus
							penalizes one who consorts with those who commit a transgression, as if
							he is actually one of those who commits the transgression, how much
							more so shall he who consorts with those who perform commandments
							receive a reward as if he is actually one of those who performs the
							commandments!”

							Just as in the case of two witnesses, if one of them was found to be a
							relative or otherwise disqualified, their whole evidence is rendered
							void, so it is with three, if one of them was found to be a relative or
							otherwise disqualified, the whole evidence is void. How do we know that
							this is the case even with a hundred? The Torah states “witnesses”.
							Rabbi Yose said: “When is this true? With regards to capital cases; but
							in monetary suits, the evidence may be established by the rest. Rabbis
							says: “It is one and the same rule, be it in monetary suits or capital
							cases.” This is the rule when both disqualified witnesses warned the
							trasngressor, but when they did not warn him, what could two brothers
							do that saw someone killing a person?

							If two persons see him the transgressor from one window and two other
							persons see him from another window and one standing in the middle
							warns him, then, if some on one side and some on the other side can see
							one another, they constitute together one body of evidence, but if they
							cannot see one another, they are two bodies of evidence. Consequently,
							if one of these is found to be a perjurer, both the transgressor and
							those two witnesses are put to death, while other group of witnesses is
							exempt. Rabbi Yose says: “He is never put to death unless two witnesses
							had warned him, as it says, “by the mouth of two witnesses..” (Deut.
							17:6). Another interpretation: “By the mouth of two witnesses”: that
							the Sanhedrin shall not hear the evidence from the mouth of an
							interpreter.

							The following go into banishment: one who kills in error. If for
							instance while he was pushing a roller on the roof and it fell down and
							killed somebody; If while he was lowering a cask it fell down and
							killed somebody; If while coming down a ladder he fell on somebody and
							killed him, he goes into banishment. But, if while he was pulling up
							the roller it fell back and killed somebody; If while he was raising a
							cask and the rope snapped and the cask fell and killed somebody; If
							while going up a ladder he fell down and killed somebody, he does not
							go into banishment. This is the general principle: whenever the death
							was caused in the course of a downward movement, he goes into
							banishment, but if it was caused not in the course of a downward
							movement, he does not go into banishment. If the iron slipped from its
							heft and killed somebody: Rabbi says, “He does not go into banishment.”
							And the Sages say: “He goes into banishment.” If it flew from the log
							being split: Rabbi says, “He goes into banishment.” And the Sages say:
							“He does not go into banishment.”

							If a man threw a stone into the public domain and killed a person, he
							goes into banishment. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: “If after the stone
							had left his hand another person put out his head and caught it, the
							thrower is exempt from banishment.” If a man threw a stone into his own
							court and killed a person, then, if the victim had a right of entry
							there, the thrower goes into banishment, and if not, he does not go
							into banishment, as it says, “As when a man goes into the forest with
							his neighbor” (Deut. 19:5): the forest is a domain accessible to the
							victim and to the slayer and it therefore excludes the court of the
							householder where the victim has no right of entry. Abba Shaul says:
							“Hewing of wood is an optional act and it therefore excludes a father
							beating his son, or a master disciplining his pupil, or an agent of the
							court administering lashes.”

							The father goes into banishment for the death of his son, and the son

							the death of an Israelite, and Israelites go into banishment on their
							account, except for a resident alien. And a resident alien does not go
							into banishment except for the death of another resident alien. A blind
							person does not go into banishment, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi
							Meir says: “He goes into banishment.” An enemy does not go into
							banishment. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: “An enemy is executed, for it is
							as if he has been warned.” Rabbi Shimon says: “There is an enemy that
							goes into banishment and there is an enemy that does not go into
							banishment: wherever it can be said that he had killed his victim
							wittingly, he goes not into banishment, and where he had slain
							unwittingly, he goes into banishment.

							To where are they banished? To the cities of refuge, to the three
							cities situated on the far side of the Jordan and the three cities
							situated in Canaan, as it says, “Three cities shall be designated
							beyond the Jordan, and the other three shall be designated in the land
							of Canaan” (Numbers 35:14). Not until three cities were selected in the
							land of Israel did the first three cities beyond the jordan receive
							fugitives, as it says, “Six cities of refuge in all” (Numbers 35:13),
							until all six could simultaneously receive fugitives.

							And direct roads were made leading from one to the other, as it says,
							“You shall prepare the way and divide the borders of your land into
							three parts” (Deut. 19:3). And they delegate to him to disciples of the
							Sages as escorts in case anyone attempted to slay him on the way, and
							that they might speak to him. Rabbi Meir says: “He may even plead his
							cause himself, as it says, “And this is the word of the manslayer”
							(Deut. 19:4).

							Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: “Initially a slayer is sent in advance to
							one of the cities of refuge, whether he had slain in error or with
							intent and then the court sends and brings him out. Whoever was found
							guilty of a capital crime the court had executed, and whoever was found
							not guilty of a capital crime they acquitted. Whoever was found liable
							to banishment they restored to his place of refuge as it says, “And the
							congregation shall restore him to the city of refuge to which he fled”
							(Numbers 35:25). All the same are the deaths of the high priest who had
							been anointed with the anointing oil; or had worn many garments, or had
							retired from his office all make possible the return of the manslayer.
							Rabbi Judah says also the death of the priest who had been anointed for
							war makes possible the return of the manslayer. Therefore, mothers of
							high priests would provide food and clothing for them who had been
							exiled that they might not pray for their son’s death. If the high
							priest died at the conclusion of the trial, the slayer does not go into
							banishment. If he died before the trial was concluded and another high
							priest was appointed in his stead and the trial was then concluded, the
							slayer returns home from refuge only after the latter’s death.

						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 5 - Makkot: Perek 2: Mishnah 7

						-
							If the trial was concluded when there was no high priest in office, or
							if one kills a high priest, or a high priest that kills, in these cases
							the manslayer can never come away from that place of refuge. He the
							manslayer may not go out to bear witness, neither for cases having to
							do with a religious observance, nor to bear witness in a monetary suit,
							nor to bear witness in a capital case. Even should all Israel need him,
							and even a general like Yoav the son of Zeruiah, he may never go out,
							as it is said, “to there he fled”: ‘there’ must be his abode, ‘there’
							his death, ‘there’ his burial. Just as the city affords asylum so does
							its Sabbath boundary afford asylum. If a manslayer went beyond the
							boundary of the city and the blood avenger found him: Rabbi Yose the
							Galilean says: “For the avenger it is a matter of obligation to kill
							him; for everyone else, a matter of option.” Rabbi Akiba says: “It is a
							matter of option for the avenger, and anyone else who kills him is not
							liable for doing so.” If a tree was standing within the boundary and
							its boughs extended beyond the boundary or if it was standing outside
							of the boundary and its boughs extended within, it wholly follows the
							position of the boughs. If he slew someone in that city of refuge he is
							banished from one neighborhood to another neighborhood. And a Levite is
							banished from one city to another.

							How many lashes is he given? Forty save one, as it says, “By number

							receive the additional lash? Between his shoulders.

							When they estimate the number of lashes he can stand it must be a
							number divisible by three. If they estimated him capable of receiving
							forty, and after receiving some they said he cannot receive forty, he
							is exempt from the rest. If they estimated him fit to receive eighteen,
							and after he was lashed they said he could receive forty, he is exempt
							from the rest. If he committed a transgression which violated two
							prohibitions and they made one estimate for the lashes for both
							prohibitions, he is lashed and then exempt from more. And if they had
							not made one estimate for both, he is lashed for one transgression, is
							allowed to recover and then is lashed again.

							How do they lash him? His two hands are tied to a pillar on either side
							of it and the minister of the synagogue grabs his clothing, if they are
							torn, they are torn; if they are ripped open, they are ripped open,
							until he exposes the offender’s chest. And a stone is placed behind the
							offender, the minister of the synagogue stands on it, a strap of
							cowhide in his hands, doubled over into two, and redoubled, and two
							straps that rise and fall attached to it.

					-
						Seder 4 - Nezikin: Masekhet 5 - Makkot: Perek 3: Mishnah 13
					-
						-
							The handle is a handbreadth long and a handbreadth wide, its tip
							reaching to the edge of the offender’s abdomen. He administers
							one-third of the lashes in front and two-thirds behind. He lashes him
							not in a standing or sitting position but stooping, as it says, “And
							the judge shall cause him to fall stoop down” (Deut. 25:2). He who
							administers the lashes lashes with his one hand and with his whole
							force.

							And the one who recites, says: “If you fail to observe faithfully all
							the terms of this Teaching…the Lord will inflict upon you extraordinary
							plagues (lashes)” (Deut. 25:58-59) And then (if time remains) he
							returns to the beginning of the section. “Therefore observe faithfully
							all the terms of this covenant” (Deut. 28:9) and he completes by
							saying, “And He is merciful, forgiving iniquity” (Psalms 78:38). If the
							offender dies under his hand, he is exempt from penalty. If he gave him
							one more lash and the offender died, he goes into banishment. If the
							offender befouled himself either with feces or urine, he is exempt.
							Rabbi Judah says: “Feces in the case of a man and even urine in the
							case of a woman.

							All who have incurred the penalty of kareth, on being flogged are
							exempt from their punishment of kareth, for it says, “He may be given
							up to forty lashes, but not more ... lest your brother shall be
							dishonored before your eyes” (Deut. 25;3) once he has been lashed he is
							considered “your brother”, the words of Rabbi Hananiah ben Gamaliel.
							Rabbi Hananiah ben Gamaliel said: “Just as one who transgresses one
							transgression forfeits his life, how much more does one who performs
							one commandment have his life granted him.” Rabbi Shimon says: “You can
							learn this from its own passage; as it says: “All who do any of those
							abhorrent things such persons shall be cut off from their people” (Lev.
							18:29), and it says: “You shall keep my statutes and my ordinances
							which if a man do, he shall live by them” (Lev. 18:5), which means that
							one who desists from transgressing is granted reward like one who
							performs a precept. Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi says: Behold the Torah says,
							“But makes sure that you do not partake of the blood; for the blood is
							the life, and you must not consume the life with the flesh…that it may
							go well with you and with your descendents to come..” (Deut.
							12:23-25”-- now, if in the case of blood which a person’s soul loathes,
							anyone who refrains from it receives reward, how much more so in regard
							to robbery and sexual sin for which a person’s soul craves and longs
							shall one who refrains from them acquire merit for himself and for
							generations and generations to come, to the end of all generations!

							him: “Granted that the Day of Atonement goat may be offered up on the
							new month, but how can the new month goat be offered up on the Day of

							“No! If you say that for an oath with regards to an optional matter he
							is liable, it is because Scripture has in that case made negative equal
							to positive for liability; But how can you say that for an oath to
							fulfill a commandment he is liable, since Scripture has not in that

							witnesses, “Come and bear testimony for me”, and they replied, “We
							swear that we will not bear testimony for you”. If he swore to annul a
							commandment, for example not to make a sukkah, or not to take a lulav,

							liable. If he adjured them five times outside the court, and the they
							came to the court and admitted knowledge of testimony, they are exempt.
							If they denied, they are liable for each oath. If he adjured them five

							intentional transgression of the oath, and for its unintentional
							transgression coupled with intentional denial of having received the
							deposit, but he is not liable for unintentional transgression. And what
							is he liable for the intentional transgression of the oath? A guilt
							offering of the value of two shekels of silver.

							have in your possession” and the other replied: “I swear that you have
							nothing in my possession”; or he replied to him; “You have nothing in
							my possession,” and the depositor said: “I adjure you”, and he
							responded, “Amen!”, he is liable. If he adjured him five times, whether
							before the court or not before the court, and he denied, he is liable
							for each one. Rabbi Shimon said: “What is the reason? Because he can
							retract and admit.”

							If five claimed from him, and said to him: “Give us the deposit that we

							that you have nothing in my possession, nor you, nor you,” he is liable
							for each one. Rabbi Eliezer says: “Only if he says, ‘I swear’ at the
							end.” Rabbi Shimon says: “Only if he says, ‘I swear’ to each one.”
							“Give me the deposit, loan, theft, and lost object that I have in your
							possession,” and he replied, “I swear that you do not have these in my
							possession,” he is liable only once. “I swear that you do not have in
							my possession a deposit, a loan, a theft, and a lost object,” he is
							liable for each one. “Give me the wheat, barley, and spelt that I have
							in your possession”, and he replied, “I swear that you do not have
							these in my possession,” he is liable only once. “I swear that you do
							not have in my possession wheat, barley, and spelt,” he is liable for

							barley and spelt,’ he is liable for each one.

							The oath of the judges is imposed when the claim is at least two silver

							this so? “Two silver ma’ahs of mine are in your possession,” and the
							other replies, “I have nothing of yours in my possession except a
							perutah,” he is exempt. “Two silver ma’ahs of mine and a perutah are in
							your possession,” and the other replies, “I have nothing of yours in my

							are in your possession”, and the other replies, “I have nothing of

							possession”, and the other replies, “I have of yours only fifty
							denarii,” he is liable. “You have of my father’s a hundred denarii”,

							before witnesses.” The next day he said to him, “Give them to me;” and
							he replied, “I have given them to you,” he is liable, because he should

							of coinage. “You have of mine a kor of grain”, and he replies, “I have
							of yours only a letek of beans”, he is exempt. “You have of mine a kor
							of produce”, and he replies, “I have of yours only a letek of beans,”
							he is liable, for beans are included in produce. If he claimed from him
							wheat, and the other admitted barley, he is exempt. But Rabban Gamaliel
							makes him liable. If he claims from his neighbor jars of oil, and he
							admits his claim to the empty jars, Admon says, since he admits to him
							a portion of the same kind as the claim, he must swear. But the sages
							say, the admission is not of the same kind as the claim. Rabban
							Gamaliel said, “I approve the words of admon. If he claims from him
							vessels and lands, and he admits the vessels, but denies the lands; or
							admits the lands, but denies the vessels, he is exempt. If he admits a
							portion of the lands, he is exempt; a portion of the vessels, he is

							properties for which there is security to take an oath for them.

							the Sages say: “All that is attached to land is like land.” An oath is

							other says, “I have not received it,” he the laborer takes an oath and
							collects his wages. Rabbi Judah says: “There is no oath unless there is

							Shammai says: “For all women who begin to menstruate it suffices to
							reckon their impurity from the time of their discovering it.” And
							Hillel says: “Their impurity is reckoned backwards from the last

							days.” But the Sages say: “Neither according to the opinion of this one
							nor according to the opinion of this one, but they are considered
							impure for the past twenty four hours when this lessens the period from
							the last examination to the previous examination, and for the period
							from the last examination to the previous examination when this lessens

							suffices to reckon her impurity from her set time. She who uses
							testing-cloths when she has sexual relations, behold this is like an

							or the period from the last examination to the previous examination.

							came from the olive-picking or who came from overseas; they mentioned

							changed their mind and taught according to Beth Shammai. Beth Shammai
							says: “She may be married again and take her kethubah payment.” But
							Beth Hillel says: “She may be married again but may not take her
							kethubah payment.” Beth Shammai said to them: “You have permitted the
							graver matter of a forbidden marriage, should you not permit the
							lighter matter of property? ” Beth Hillel said to them: “We have found
							that brothers do not inherit on her statement.” Beth Shammai said to
							them: “Do we not infer it from her marriage document in which he writes
							to her ‘That if you be married to another you shall take what is
							written for you’? ” Then Beth Hillel changed their mind and taught

							Rabbi Hanina, chief of the priests, testified concerning four
							matters:Through all their days the priests never refrained from burning
							meat which had been defiled by an “offspring” of impurity with meat
							which had been made impure by a “father” of impurity, although they
							were thereby increasing its impurity by a higher impurity. Rabbi Akiba
							added: “Through all their days the priests never shrank from lighting
							oil which had been rendered unfit by a tevul yom in a lamp made impure
							by one who was made impure by a corpse, although they were thereby
							increasing its impurity by a higher impurity.”

							But the Sages say: “A testimony which consists of ‘we didn’t see’ is

							He also testified concerning a small village in the vicinity of
							Jerusalem in which there was an old man who used to lend to all the
							people of the village and write out the bond in his own handwriting and
							others signed it. And when the fact was brought before the Sages they
							pronounced it legal. Hence, incidentally, you may infer that a wife may
							write her own bill of divorcement, and a husband may write his own
							receipt; for the legality of a document depends only on those who sign
							it. And he testified concerning a needle which was found in flesh of a
							sacrifice, that the knife and the hands which had been employed on the
							flesh are clean, but the flesh itself is defiled; and if it was found
							in the excrement, all are clean.

							Rabbi Yishmael declared three things before the Sages in the vineyard

							ear of corn in the harvesting, the top of which reached the standing
							corn that if it can be reaped together with the standing corn, it
							belongs to the owner; and if not, it belongs to the poor. And
							concerning a small garden which was surrounded by a row of vines that
							if it has space for the grape-gatherer and his basket on one side, and
							space for the grape-gatherer and his basket on the other side, it may
							be sown with seed; but if not, it may not be sown with seed.

							them.One who lances an abscess on the Sabbath: if it was to make an
							opening he is liable; if it was to bring out the pus, he is exempt. And
							concerning one who hunts a snake on the Sabbath: that if he was
							occupied with it in order that it should not bite him, he is innocent;
							but if that he might use it as a remedy, he is guilty. And concerning
							Ironian stewpots: that they do not contract impurity when under the
							same tent as a corpse; but become impure if they are carried by a zav.
							Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok says: “Even if they are carried by a zav they
							remain pure, because they are unfinished.”

							In the case of all things which cause defilement in a “tent”, if they
							the pieces of the corpse were divided and brought into the house, Rabbi
							Dosa ben Harkinas pronounces everything under the same roof-space
							clean, but the Sages pronounce it unclean. How so? He who touches as
							much as two halves of an olive in quantity of an animal’s carcass or
							carries them; or in the case of a human corpse, he who touches as much
							as half an olive and stands over as much as half an olive; or touches
							as much as half an olive and as much as half an olive is above him; or
							if he stands over as much as two halves of an olive; or if he stands
							over as much as half an olive and as much as half an olive is above him
							Rabbi Dosa b. Harkinas pronounces him clean, and the Sages pronounce
							him unclean. 3A) But if he touches as much as half an olive in quantity
							and another thing was over him and over as much as half an olive; or if
							he stood over as much as half an olive and another thing was over him
							and over as much as half an olive, he is clean. Rabbi Meir said: “Also
							in this case Rabbi Dosa pronounces him clean and the sages pronounce
							him unclean. In all such cases a man is unclean unless there is an act
							of touching and also an act of carrying, or an act of carrying and also
							the fact of being under the same roof-space.” This is the general rule:
							in whatever case the means of causing defilement are of one category,
							he is unclean; if they are of two categories, he is clean.”

							Food which is in separate pieces does not combine together to receive

							uncoined metal, according to Rabbi Dosa. But the Sages say: “One may
							not so exchange it.” The hands alone need to be immersed for the waters
							of purification according to Rabbi Dosa. But the Sages say: “If his

							and something pure is in the public domain; Or if something pure is in

							Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up the blood ,
							but Beth Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made
							ready. But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a
							pronged tool and cover up the blood, and that the ashes of a stove
							count as being prepared for the holiday.

							counted as ownerless unless it is made ownerless also with respect to
							the rich, as in the year of release (shmittah). If all the sheaves of
							the field were of one kav each and one was of four kavs, and it was
							forgotten, Beth Shammai says: it does not count as forgotten, And Beth
							Hillel says: it counts as forgotten.

							receive impurity. One who had anointed himself with clean oil and then
							became unclean, and he went down and immersed himself, Beth Shammai
							says: although he still drips oil, it is clean. And Beth Hillel says:
							only while there remains enough for anointing a small limb. And if from
							the beginning it was unclean oil, Beth Shammai says: it is unclean as
							long as there remains enough for anointing a small limb, And Beth
							Hillel says: even if there remains as much as a moist liquid. Rabbi
							Judah says in the name of Beth Hillel: provided it remains moist itself
							and can also moisten other things.

							A woman is betrothed by a denar or the value of a denar, according to

							value of a perutah. And how much is a perutah? One-eighth of an Italian
							issar. Beth Shammai says: one may dismiss his wife with an old bill of
							divorcement, But Beth Hillel forbids it. What is an old bill of
							divorcement? Whenever he was secluded with her after he has written it
							for her. One who divorces his wife and she afterwards spends a night
							with him at the same inn: Beth Shammai says: she does not require a
							second bill of divorcement from him. But Beth Hillel says: she requires
							a second bill of divorcement from him. When does she require a second
							bill of divorcement? When she was divorced after marriage. But if she
							was divorced after betrothal she does not require from him a second
							bill of divorcement, since he is not yet familiar with her.

							Beth Shammai permits the rival wives of a deceased brother to be

							have married their brother-in-law, Beth Shammai pronounce them fit to
							marry into the priesthood, But Beth Hillel pronounced them unfit. And
							although these pronounce unfit and these pronounce fit, Beth Shammai
							did not refrain from marrying women from the daughters of Beth Hillel,
							nor did Beth Hillel refrain from marrying women from the daughters of
							Beth Shammai. And in the case of all matters of purity and impurity in
							respect to which these pronounce pure and these pronounce impure, they
							did not refrain from preparing foods requiring a condition of purity
							each by means of the vessels of the other.

							other widow is released on the grounds of the law forbidding the wife’s
							sister. But Beth Hillel says: he should put away his wife with a get
							and halitzah, and the wife of his brother he should put away with
							halitzah. This is the case of which they said: woe to him because of
							his wife, and woe to him because of his brother’s wife!

							One who has two groups of witnesses who testify about him, these
							testifying that he vowed two naziriteships and these testifying that he
							vowed five: Beth Shammai says: their testimony is divided, and there is

							Rabbi Judah says: there are six instances of lenient rulings by Beth

							unclean. An egg found in a bird’s carcass: if the like of it were sold
							in the market, it is permitted, and if not, it is forbidden, according
							to the opinion of Beth Shammai. And Beth Hillel forbids it. But they
							agree in the case of an egg found in a trefa bird that it is forbidden
							since it had its growth in a forbidden condition. 3+4) The blood of a
							non-Jewish woman and the blood of purity of a leprous woman: Beth
							Shammai pronounces clean; And Beth Hillel says: it is like her spittle
							and her urine. One may eat fruits of the seventh year with an
							expression of thanks and without an expression of thanks to the owner
							of the field, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. But Beth Hillel
							says: one may not eat with an expression of thanks. Beth Shammai says:
							a waterskin is liable to become impure only if it is tied up and
							remains unimpaired. And the school of Hillel says: even if it is not
							tied up.

							put on the table together with it nor eaten with it. Olives may be

							sows seed within four cubits of a vineyard: Beth Shammai says: he has
							caused one row of vines to be prohibited. But Beth Hillel says: he has
							caused two rows to be prohibited. Flour paste flour that had been mixed
							with boiling water: Beth Shammai exempts from the law of hallah; But
							Beth Hillel pronounces it liable. One may immerse oneself in a
							rain-torrent, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai; But Beth Hillel
							say: one may not immerse oneself therein. One who became a proselyte on
							the eve of Passover: Beth Shammai says: he may immerse himself and eat
							his Passover sacrifice in the evening. But Beth Hillel says: one who
							separates himself from uncircumcision is as one who separates himself

							Akavia ben Mahalalel testified concerning four things. They said to

							you the head of the court in Israel. He said to them: it is better for
							me to be called a fool all my days than that I should become even for
							one hour a wicked man before God; So they shouldn’t say: “he withdrew
							his opinions for the sake of power.” He used to pronounce impure the
							hair which has been left over in leprosy, And green (yellow) blood (of
							vaginal discharge); But the Sages declared them clean. He used to
							permit the wool of a first-born animal which was blemished and which
							had fallen out and had been put in a niche, the first-born being
							slaughtered afterwards; But the sages forbid it. He used to say: a
							woman proselyte and a freed slave-woman are not made to drink of the
							bitter waters. But the Sages say: they are made to drink. They said to
							him: it happened in the case of Karkemith, a freed slave-woman who was
							in Jerusalem, that Shemaiah and Avtalion made her drink. He said to
							them: they made her drink an example (and not the real water).
							Whereupon they excommunicated him; and he died while he was under
							excommunication, and the court stoned his coffin. Rabbi Judah said: God
							forbid that one should say that Akavia was excommunicated; for the
							courtyard is never locked for any man in Israel who was equal to Avavia
							ben Mahalalel in wisdom and the fear of sin. But whom did they
							excommunicate? Eliezer the son of Hanoch who cast doubt against the
							laws concerning the purifying of the hands. And when he died the court
							sent and laid a stone on his coffin. This teaches that whoever is
							excommunicated and dies while under excommunication, his coffin is

							Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunia ben Elinathan, a man of Kefar Habavli,
							testified concerning a limb separated from a corpse that it is impure;
							whereas Rabbi Eliezer says: they declared this only of a limb from a
							living man. They said to him: is not there an inference from the minor
							to the major (kal vehomer): If in the case of a living man who is
							himself pure a limb severed from him is impure, how much more in the
							case of a corpse which is itself impure should a limb severed from it
							be impure! He said to them: they have nevertheless declared it only of
							a limb from a living man. Another answer: The impurity of living men is
							greater than the impurity of corpses, because a living man causes that
							on which he lies and sits to become capable of making impure a man and
							clothing, and he causes also what is over him to transfer impurity to
							foods and liquids- which is defilement that a corpse does not cause.

							not come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to
							bring near, but to put away those brought near by force and to bring
							near those put away by force. The family of Beth Tzriphah was on the
							other side of the Jordan and Ben Zion put it away by force; and yet
							another family was there, and Ben Zion brought it near by force. It is
							such as these that Elijah will come to pronounce unclean or to
							pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near. Rabbi Judah says: to
							bring near, but not to put away. Rabbi Shimon says: to conciliate
							disputes. And the Sages say: neither to put away nor to bring near, but
							to make peace in the world, for it is said, “Behold I send to you

							and then sell it to him, because a defective animal is not sacrificed
							to an idol. As for other things, if they are not specified their sale

							Rabbi Judah said: Rabbi Ishmael put this question to Rabbi Joshua as

							nevelah (an animal that was not properly slaughtered.” He (Rabbi
							Ishmael) said: “but is not the rennet of a burnt-offering more strictly
							forbidden than the rennet of a nevelah? and yet it was said that a
							priest who is not fastidious may suck it out raw.” (Though the Sages
							disagreed with this opinion, and they said that no benefit may be
							derived from it, although one who consumed it did not trespass temple
							property). Rabbi Joshua responded: “The reason then is because they
							curdle it with the rennet from calves sacrificed to idols.” He (Rabbi
							Ishmael) said to him: “if that be so, why do they not extend the
							prohibition to any benefit derived from it? ” He (Rabbi Joshua)
							diverted him to another matter, saying: “Ishmael, how do you read for
							your masc. love is more delightful than wine” or “your fem. love etc.
							(Song of Songs 1:2” He replied: “your fem. love is better …” He said to

							come into her domain, she has come into mine. People do not say, ‘the
							bath was made as an adornment for Aphrodite’; rather they say,
							‘Aphrodite was made as an adornment for the bath.’ Another reason is,
							even if you were given a large sum of money, you would not enter the
							presence of your idol while you were nude or had experienced seminal
							emission, nor would you urinate before it. But this statue of Aphrodite
							stands by a sewer and all people urinate before it. In the torah it is

							out again, the house is permitted. There are three kinds of idolatrous
							stones: A stone which a man hewed originally to serve as a pedestal for
							an idol behold this is prohibited. If one plastered and tiled a stone
							for idolatry, one may remove the plaster and tile, and it is then
							permitted. If he set an idol upon it and took it off, behold the stone
							is permitted. There are three kinds of asherah: a tree which has
							originally been planted for idolatry behold this is prohibited. If he
							chopped and trimmed a tree for idolatry, and its sprouted afresh, he
							removes the new growth. If he only set an idol under it and took it
							away, behold the tree is permitted. What is an asherah? Any tree
							beneath which there is an idol. Rabbi Shimon says: any tree which is
							worshipped. It happened at Sidon that there was a tree which was
							worshipped and they found a heap of stones beneath it. Rabbi Shimon
							said to them, “examine this heap.” They examined it and discovered an
							image in it. He said to them, “since it is the image that they worship,

							The idol of an idolater is prohibited immediately; but if it belonged

							The sages taught in the language of the mishnah. Blessed be He who
							chose them and their teaching. Rabbi Meir said: Whoever occupies
							himself with the Torah for its own sake, merits many things; not only
							that but he is worth the whole world.He is called beloved friend; one
							that loves God; one that loves humankind; one that gladdens God; one
							that gladdens humankind. And the Torah clothes him in humility and
							reverence, and equips him to be righteous, pious, upright and
							trustworthy; it keeps him far from sin, and brings him near to merit.
							And people benefit from his counsel, sound knowledge, understanding and
							strength, as it is said, “Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am
							understanding, strength is mine” (Proverbs 8:14). And it bestows upon
							him royalty, dominion, and acuteness in judgment. To him are revealed
							the secrets of the Torah, and he is made as an ever-flowing spring, and
							like a stream that never ceases. And he becomes modest, long-suffering
							and forgiving of insult. And it magnifies him and exalts him over

							Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: every day a bat kol (a heavenly voice) goes

							As it is said, “Like a gold ring in the snout of a pig is a beautiful
							woman bereft of sense” (Proverbs 22:11). And it says, “And the tablets
							were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven
							upon the tablets” (Exodus 32:16). Read not haruth ‘graven’ but heruth
							‘freedom’. For there is no free man but one that occupies himself with
							the study of the Torah. And whoever regularly occupies himself with the
							study of the Torah he is surely exalted, as it is said, “And from
							Mattanah to Nahaliel; and Nahaliel to Bamoth” (Numbers 21:19).

							One who learns from his fellow one chapter, or one halakhah, or one

							Ahitophel no more than two things, yet called him his master, his guide
							and his beloved friend, as it is said, “But it was you, a man mine
							equal, my guide and my beloved friend” (Psalms 55:14). Is this not an
							instance of the argument “from the less to the greater” (kal vehomer)?
							If David, king of Israel who learned from Ahitophel no more than two
							things, nevertheless called him his master, his guide and his beloved
							friend; then in the case of one who learns from his fellow one chapter,
							or one halakhah, or one verse, or one word, or even one letter, all the
							more so he is under obligation to treat him with honor. And “honor’”
							means nothing but Torah, as it is said, “It is honor that sages
							inherit” (Proverbs 3:35). “And the perfect shall inherit good”
							(Proverbs 28:10), and “good” means nothing but Torah, as it is said,
							“For I give you good instruction; do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs

							Greater is learning Torah than the priesthood and than royalty, for
							royalty is acquired by thirty stages, and the priesthood by
							twenty-four, but the Torah by forty-eight things. By study, Attentive
							listening, Proper speech, By an understanding heart, By an intelligent
							heart, By awe, By fear, By humility, By joy, By attending to the sages,
							By critical give and take with friends, By fine argumentation with
							disciples, By clear thinking, By study of Scripture, By study of
							mishnah, By a minimum of sleep, By a minimum of chatter, By a minimum
							of pleasure, By a minimum of frivolity, By a minimum of preoccupation
							with worldly matters, By long-suffering, By generosity, By faith in the
							sages, By acceptance of suffering. Learning of Torah is also acquired
							by one Who recognizes his place, Who rejoices in his portion, Who makes
							a fence about his words, Who takes no credit for himself, Who is loved,
							Who loves God, Who loves his fellow creatures, Who loves righteous
							ways, Who loves reproof, Who loves uprightness, Who keeps himself far
							from honors, Who does not let his heart become swelled on account of
							his learning, Who does not delight in giving legal decisions, Who
							shares in the bearing of a burden with his colleague, Who judges with
							the scales weighted in his favor, Who leads him on to truth, Who leads
							him on to peace, Who composes himself at his study, Who asks and
							answers, Who listens to others, and himself adds to his knowledge, Who
							learns in order to teach, Who learns in order to practice, Who makes
							his teacher wiser, Who is exact in what he has learned, And who says a
							thing in the name of him who said it. Thus you have learned: everyone
							who says a thing in the name of him who said it, brings deliverance

							Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai:

							of righteousness” (Proverbs 16:3, And it says: “The ornament of the

							(ibid. 17:6), And it says: “The glory of youths is their strength; and

							“Then the moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall be abashed. For the
							Lord of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and God’s
							Honor will be revealed to his elders” (Isaiah 24:23). Rabbi Shimon ben

							Rabbi Yose ben Kisma said: Once I was walking by the way when a man met

							you from? ” I said to him, “I am from a great city of sages and
							scribes”. He said to me, “Rabbi, would you consider living with us in
							our place? I would give you a thousand thousand denarii of gold, and
							precious stones and pearls.” I said to him: “My son, even if you were
							to give me all the silver and gold, precious stones and pearls that are
							in the world, I would not dwell anywhere except in a place of Torah;
							for when a man passes away there accompany him neither gold nor silver,
							nor precious stones nor pearls, but Torah and good deeds alone, as it
							is said, “When you walk it will lead you. When you lie down it will
							watch over you; and when you are awake it will talk with you” (Proverbs
							6:22). “When you walk it will lead you” in this world. “When you lie
							down it will watch over you” in the grave; “And when you are awake it
							will talk with you” in the world to come. And thus it is written in the
							book of Psalms by David, king of Israel, “I prefer the teaching You
							proclaimed to thousands of pieces of gold and silver” (Psalms 119:71),
							And it says: “Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, says the Lord of

							Five possessions did the Holy Blessed One, set aside as his own in this

							another possession; Abraham, another possession; Israel, another
							possession; The Temple, another possession. 1a) The Torah is one
							possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written, “The Lord
							possessed (usually translated as ‘created’ me at the beginning of his
							course, at the first of His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22). , 2a) Heaven
							and earth, another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is
							said: “Thus said the Lord: The heaven is My throne and the earth is My
							footstool; Where could you build a house for Me, What place could serve
							as My abode? (Isaiah 66:1) And it says: “How many are the things You
							have made, O Lord; You have made them all with wisdom; the earth is
							full of Your possessions” (Psalms 104:24). 3a) Abraham is another
							possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written: “He
							blessed him, saying, “Blessed by Abram of God Most High, Possessor of
							heaven and earth” (Genesis 15:19). 4a) Israel is another possession.
							From where do we know this? Since it is written: “Till Your people
							cross over, O Lord, Till Your people whom You have possessed” (Exodus
							15:16). And it says: “As to the holy and mighty ones that are in the
							land, my whole desire (possession) is in them” (Psalms 16:3). 5a) The
							Temple is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is
							said: “The sanctuary, O lord, which your hands have established”
							(Exodus 15:17”, And it says: “And He brought them to His holy realm, to
							the mountain, which His right hand had possessed” (Psalms 78:54).

							(high) priest and the former (high) priest is the bull on the Day of
							Atonement and the tenth part of the ephah. They are both equal in the
							service of the Day of Atonement, and both are commanded to marry a

							which does involve trespass when he offers it for its own name, would
							involve trespass when he changes its name? Rabbi Joshua said to him:
							No, when you speak of a hatat whose name he changed to that of an olah,

							Behold, most holy sacrifices which he slaughtered in the south and
							which he slaughtered in the name of lesser sacrifices will prove the
							matter, for he changed their name to something which does not involve
							trespass, and yet they involve trespass, so too, do not be surprised
							that in the case of the olah, although he changed its name to something
							that does not involve trespass, it still involves trespass. Rabbi
							Joshua said: No, when you speak of most holy sacrifices which are
							slaughtered in the south and in the name of lesser sacrifices, they
							involve trespass because he changed their name to something which is
							partly forbidden and partly permitted; will you say the same of an
							olah, where he changed its name to something that is altogether
							permitted?

							If he nipped the bird sacrifice with his left hand or at night; if he

							All sacrifices which became mixed up with hatats that must be left to

							sexual relations with a woman or one with whom a man had sexual
							relations; or an animal set aside for idolatry, or that had been
							worshipped as an idol; or that was the fee of a whore, or a dog's
							exchange; or that was kilayim; or terefah; or an animal born through

							The altar sanctifies whatever is eligible for it. Rabbi Joshua says:
							whatever is eligible for the altar fire does not descend once it has
							ascended, as it is said, “The olah itself shall remain where it is
							burned upon the altar all night until morning, while the fire of the
							altar is kept going on it” (Leviticus 6:: just as the olah, which is
							eligible for the altar fire, does not descend once it has ascended, so
							whatever is eligible for the altar fire does not descend once it
							ascended. Rabbi Gamaliel said: whatever is eligible for the altar does
							not descend once it ascended, as it is said: “The olah itself shall
							remain where it is burned upon the altar all night until morning, while
							the fire of the altar is kept going on it” (Leviticus 6:2): just as the
							olah, which is eligible for the altar, does not descend once it
							ascended, so whatever is eligible for the altar does not descend once
							it ascended. The only difference between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi
							Joshua is in respect of the blood and libations, for Rabban Gamaliel
							says that they cannot descend, while Rabbi Joshua says that they can
							descend. Rabbi Shimon says: if the sacrifice is fit while the libations
							which accompanied it are unfit; or if the libations are fit while the
							sacrifice is unfit; or even if both are unfit, the sacrifice does not
							descend, while the libations do descend.

							outside the appropriate place; Or if unfit persons received and
							sprinkled its blood. Rabbi Judah says: that which was slaughtered at
							night or whose blood was spilt or whose blood went outside the
							curtains, if it ascended, it must descend. Rabbi Shimon says: it does
							not descend, because Rabbi Shimon says: anything whose disqualification
							arose in sanctity, the sacred altar receives it; if its
							disqualification did not arise in sanctity, the sacred altar does not
							receive it.

							precedes a today and a nazirite’s ram, because it is a most holy
							sacrifice. A todah and a nazirite's ram precede a shelamim, because
							they are eaten one day only and require the accompaniment of loaves. A
							shelamim precedes a firstling, because it requires four blood
							applications and laying of hands, libations, and the waving of the

					-
						Seder 5 - Kodashim: Masekhet 1 - Zevachim: Perek 10: Mishnah 4

							Birds precede meal-offerings (minhah), because they are blood

							All hatats in the Torah precede ashams, except the asham of a metzora

							If the blood of a hatat spurted on to a garment, it must be washed.
							Though scripture speaks only of hatats which are eaten, for it is said,

							garment it does not require washing. Only blood which was received in a
							vessel and is fit for sprinkling requires washing. If the blood spurted
							on to the hide, before it was flayed, it does not require washing. If
							it spurted after it was flayed, it requires washing, the words of Rabbi
							Judah. Rabbi Elazar says: even if it spurted on the skin after it was

							A tebul yom and one who lacks atonement do not share in sacrifices for

							a share and may eat of the sacrifices but they may not offer them.
							Whoever is not eligible for service does not share in the flesh. And he
							who does not share in the flesh does not share in the hides. Even if
							one was unclean when the blood was sprinkled but clean when the fats
							were burned on the altar, he does not share in the flesh, for it is

							Whenever the altar does not acquire its flesh, the priests do not

							olah which went up on the altar on behalf a man. If an olah was
							slaughtered under a different designation, although it does not count

							The hides of less holy sacrifices belong to their owners. The hides of
							most holy sacrifices belong to the priest. This is a kal vehomer: if

							sacrifices, when they do acquire their flesh? The altar does not refute
							this argument, for it does not acquire the hide in any instance.

							He who slaughters and offers up outside the Temple courtyard is liable
							in respect of slaughtering and in respect of offering. Rabbi Yose the

							liable; if he slaughtered outside and offered up outside, he is not
							liable for offering up, because he offered up only that which was
							unfit. They said to him: even when one slaughters inside and offers up

							eats unclean sacrifices is not liable because he ate only that which is
							unclean. They said to him: even when an unclean person eats clean

							of flour, the frankincense, the incense, the priests’ meal-offering,
							the anointed priest’s meal-offering, and the meal offering of
							libations, if one offered up as much as an olive of one of these
							outside, he is liable. But Rabbi Elazar exempts him unless he offers up

							frankincense, if one offered one of them outside, he is liable. Rabbi
							Elazar says: he is exempt unless he offers the second too. If one

							Thus its prescribed rite inside exempts him if he does it outside,

							(Leviticus 17:4): whatever is not eligible to come before the
							Tabernacle of the Lord, one is not liable on its account. As for
							blemished animals, whether with permanent blemishes or with passing
							blemishes, if one offers them outside, he is exempt. Rabbi Shimon says:
							if one offers animals with permanent blemishes, he is exempt; if one
							offers animals with passing blemishes, he violates a negative
							commandment. As for turtledoves before their time and young pigeons
							after their time, if one offered them outside, he is exempt. Rabbi
							Shimon says: if one offers young pigeons after their time, he is
							exempt; turtledoves before their time, he violates a negative
							commandment. One who offers an animal together with its young on the
							same day, and one who offers an animal before its time, is not liable.
							Rabbi Shimon says: he violates a negative commandment. For Rabbi Shimon
							would say: whatever is eligible to come onto the altar later entails a

							his hand a small stone or a grain of salt or a drop of frankincense it

							Rabbi Shimon b. Nanas said: it is not so, but rather the absence of the

							invalidate the lambs; for so we find that when the Israelites were in
							the wilderness for forty years they offered the lambs without the
							bread, therefore now too they may offer the lambs without the bread.
							Rabbi Shimon said: the halakhah is according to the words of Ben Nanas
							but not for the reason he stated; for every offering stated in the Book
							of Numbers was offered in the wilderness, but not every offering stated
							in the book of Leviticus was offered in the wilderness; however, when
							they came into the land of Israel they offered both kinds. Why then do
							I say that the lambs may be offered without the bread? Because the
							lambs render themselves permissible without the bread, whereas bread
							without lambs, there is nothing that renders it permissible.

							morning they may not offer the lamb towards evening. If they did not
							burn the incense in the morning they burn it towards evening. Rabbi
							Shimon said: all of it was burned towards evening. For the golden altar

							These require waving but not bringing near: The log of oil of the leper
							and his guilt-offering, The first fruits, according to Rabbi Eliezer
							ben Yaakov, The innards of an individual’s shelamim and its breast and
							thigh, whether they are the offerings of men or of women, by Israelites
							but not by others; The two loaves and the two lambs of Shavuot. How
							does he perform the waving? He places the two loaves upon the two lambs
							and puts his two hands beneath them and waves them forward and backward
							and upward and downward, for it is written, “which is waved and which
							is lifted up” (Exodus 29:27). The waving was performed on the east side
							of the altar and the bringing near on the west side. The ceremony of
							waving comes before that of bringing near. The minhah of the omer and
							the minhah of jealousy require bringing near and waving. The showbread
							and the minhah with the libations require neither bringing near nor
							waving.

							Rabbi Shimon says, there are three kinds of sacrifices which require
							three commandments; two of the three apply to each kind, but none of
							them require a third. And these are they: the shelamim of the
							individual, the shelamim of the community and the asham of the leper.
							The shelamim of the individual requires the laying on of hands for the
							living animal and waving after it is slaughtered, but it does not
							require waving while alive. The shelamim of the community requires
							waving while alive and also after it is slaughtered, but it does not
							require the laying on of hands. The asham of the leper requires the
							laying on of hands and also waving while alive, but it does not require
							waving after it is slaughtered.

							One who says, “I take upon myself to offer a minhah prepared on a

							upon myself to offer a minhah prepared in a pan,” he must not bring one
							prepared on a griddle. What is the difference between a griddle mahabat
							and a pan marheshet? The pan has a lid to it, but the griddle has no
							lid, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel
							says: a pan is deep and what is prepared is spongy; a griddle is flat

							There are three periods of gathering in the olives and each crop gives

							They are then pressed with the beam Rabbi Judah says: with stones. This
							gives the second oil. They are then ground and pressed again. This
							gives the third oil. The first oil is fit for the candlestick and the
							others for menahot. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level
							are picked from the tree; they are pounded and put into the basket.

							the second crop and the second oil of the third crop are equal. As to
							the third oil of the third crop, there is none worse than it. It would
							have been logical by the following argument that menahot should also
							require the purest olive oil: if the candlestick, whose oil is not for
							eating, requires pure olive oil, how much more should menahot, whose
							oil is for eating, require pure olive oil! But the text states, “Pure
							olive oil of beaten olives for lighting” (Exodus 27:20), but not “pure

							There were two dry-measures in the Temple: the tenth and the

							For what purpose did the tenth measure serve? By it they used to
							measure all the menahot. One did not measure with a three-tenths
							measure the minhah for a bull or with a two-tenths measure the minhah
							for a ram, rather, one measured them by all by tenths. For what purpose

							thus far for a lamb. Rabbi Shimon says: there was no hin measure at
							all, for what purpose could the hin serve? But there was an additional

							With the log one measured the oil for all the menahot. Even a minhah of
							sixty tenths required sixty logs of oil. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:
							even a minhah of sixty tenths required only one log of oil, for it is
							written, “For a minhah, and for a log of oil” (Leviticus 14:21). Six
							logs were required for a bull, four for a ram, and three for a lamb;

							And they answer, “Yes.” “Shall I reap? ” And they answer, “Reap.”
							“Shall I reap? ” And they answer, “Reap.” He repeated every matter

							But the sages say: they beat it with reeds or stems of plants that the
							grains should not be crushed, and then they put it into a pipe that was
							perforated so that the fire might take hold of all of it. They spread
							it out in the Temple courtyard so that the wind might blow over it.
							Then they put it into a gristmill and took out of it a tenth of an
							ephah of flour which was sifted through thirteen sieves. What was left
							over was redeemed and might be eaten by any one; It was liable for
							hallah but exempt from tithes. Rabbi Akiba made it liable both to
							hallah and to tithes. He then came to the tenth, put in its oil and its

							omer was offered the new grain was permitted immediately, but for those
							that lived far off it was permitted only after midday. After the Temple
							was destroyed Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that it should be
							forbidden throughout the day of the waving. Rabbi Judah said: is it not
							so forbidden by the law of the Torah, for it is said, “Until this very

							which cannot be done on the eve of Shabbat does override Shabbat.

							All menahot require a vessel for works that are performed within, but
							do not require a vessel for those works that are performed outside. How
							so? The two loaves were seven handbreadths long and four wide and their
							horns were four fingerbreadths. The cakes of the showbread were ten
							handbreadths long and five wide and their horns were seven
							fingerbreadths. Rabbi Judah says: lest you err remember but the words
							“zadad yahaz.” Ben Zoma says: “And you shall set upon the table
							showbread (lehem panim) before me continually:” panim signifies that it
							should have faces.

							The table was ten handbreadths long and five wide; the showbread was
							ten handbreadths long and five wide. Each cake was placed lengthwise
							across the breadth of the table, and two and a half handbreadths were
							turned up at either side so that its length filled the entire breadth
							of the table, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: the table was
							twelve handbreadths long and six wide; the showbread was ten
							handbreadths long and five wide. Each cake was placed lengthwise across
							the breadth of the table, and two handbreadths were turned up at either
							side; and there was a space of two handbreadths between the two sets so
							that the wind could blow between them. Abba Shaul says: there they used
							to put the two dishes of frankincense for the showbread. They said to
							him: Has it not already been said, “And you shall put pure frankincense
							upon al each row” (Leviticus 24:7)? He replied, But has it not also
							been said, “And next unto al him shall be the tribe of Manasseh”
							(Numbers 2:20)?

							There were there four golden props at the corners of the table, each
							split at the top, which supported the cakes, two for the one row and
							two for the other row. And there were twenty-eight rods, each shaped
							like the half of a hollow reed, fourteen for the one row and fourteen
							for the other row. Neither the placing of the rods nor their removal
							overrode the Shabbat, but a priest used to enter on the day before
							Shabbat, pull out the rods, and place them parallel with the length of
							the table. Every article that stood in the Temple was placed with its
							length parallel with the length of the House.

							There were two tables inside the sanctuary, at the entrance of the
							Temple, the one of marble and the other of gold. On the table of marble
							they laid the showbread when it was brought in, and on the table of
							gold they laid the showbread when it was brought out, since we raise
							the status of what is holy and we don’t lower it down. And within the
							sanctuary there was a table of gold on which the showbread lay
							continually. Four priests entered: two bearing the two rows of the
							showbread in their hands and two bearing the two dishes of frankincense
							in their hands; And four went in before them, two to take away the two
							rows of the showbread and two to take away the two dishes of
							frankincense. Those who brought them in stood at the north side facing
							the south, and those who took them away stood at the south side facing
							the north. These withdrew the old and the others laid down the new, the
							handbreadth of the one being by the side of the handbreadth of the
							other, as it is said, “Before me continually” (Exodus 25:30). Rabbi
							Yose says: even if these first took away the old and the others laid
							down the new later on, this too fulfills the requirement of
							continually. They went out and laid the old bread on the table of gold
							that was in the sanctuary at its entrance. They then burned the dishes
							of frankincense and the loaves were distributed among the priests. If
							Yom Kippur fell on a Shabbat the cakes were distributed in the evening.
							If it fell on a Friday the he-goat of Yom Kippur was eaten in the
							evening. The Babylonian priests used to eat it raw for they were not
							fastidious.

							of Sukkot when it falls on Shabbat sixty-one tenths as a minhah, it is
							enough for an individual that his minhah should be one tenth less than
							that of the congregation. Rabbi Shimon said: but some of these
							sixty-one tenths are for the bullocks and some for the lambs, and they
							may not be mixed one with the other! Rather sixty tenths mingles in one
							vessel. They said to him: can sixty be mingled in one vessel and not
							sixty-one? He answered, so it is with all the measures prescribed by
							the sages: a man may immerse himself in forty seahs of water, but he
							may not immerse himself in forty seahs less one kortob. One may not
							offer one log, two, or five logs, but one may offer three, four, six,
							or anything above six.

							If one said, “I take upon myself to offer an olah,” he must offer it in

							the Temple, yet if he offered it in the Temple of Onias he has
							fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Shimon says: this is not an olah. If
							one said, “I will be a nazirite,” he must bring his offerings and shave
							his hair in the Temple. And if he brought them and shaved his hair in
							the Temple of Onias he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he said, “I
							will be a nazirite but I will bring my offerings and shave my hair in
							the Temple of Onias,” he must bring them in the Temple, yet if he
							brought them and shaved his hair in the Temple of Onias he has
							fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Shimon says: such a one is not a

							in the Temple in Jerusalem; and needless to say this is so of priests
							who served something else; for it is said, “The priests of the shrines,
							however, did not ascend the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. But they
							did eat unleavened bread along with their kinsmen” (II Kings 23:9).
							Thus they are like those that had a blemish: they are entitled to share

							It is said of the olah of cattle, “An offering made by fire of pleasing

							fire of pleasing odor (vs. 17); and of the minhah, “An offering made by
							fire of pleasing odor” (Leviticus 2:2): to teach you that it is the
							same whether one offers much or little, so long as one directs one’s
							heart to heaven. Congratulations! We have finished Tractate Menahot! It
							is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish
							learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and
							relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons
							will stay with us for all of our lives. It is no accident that the last
							mishnah of the tractate finishes with the message that we learned
							today. After having learned 14 chapters of Zevahim and 13 chapters of
							Menahot, there is a grave danger that one could learn that all God
							cares about, and all that is important in Judaism, is bringing the
							proper sacrifice in the proper manner. Our mishnah teaches that the
							important issue is the proper intent, that one’s intent in sacrifice
							should be to worship God. This is not to deny that that the minutiae of
							rules are extremely important, both in the eyes of the rabbis and
							surely in the eyes of the priests who served in the Temple while it
							still stood. Rather, what today’s mishnah seems to say is that the
							rules are an outer manifestation of the inner kavannah, intent, of the
							worshipper. Without following the rules, there is no way to bring that
							intent into the world. But without the intent, the rules are just empty
							exercises devoid of meaning. I believe that this is a message that is
							as true of Judaism today as it was in Temple times. Mishnah Menahot has
							probably been a great challenge for many of you; I know it was for me.
							So please accept an extra congratulations on completing it. Tomorrow we
							begin Hullin, the one tractate in all of Seder Kodashim that does not
							deal with sacrifices or the Temple.

							is the appropriate place for nipping, and the whole of the front of the

							that the place which is appropriate for slaughtering is inappropriate
							for nipping, and the place which is appropriate for nipping is

							One who slaughtered a dying animal: Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:
							the slaughtering is invalid unless it jerked its foreleg and its hind
							leg. Rabbi Eliezer says: it is enough if it spurted the blood. Rabbi
							Shimon said: even if one slaughtered a dying animal by night and the
							following morning he got up early and found the sides of the throat
							full of blood, the slaughtering is valid, for this proves that it
							spurted the blood, as is Rabbi Eliezer's measure. The sages say: the
							slaughtering is invalid unless it jerked either its foreleg or its hind
							leg, or it moved its tail to and fro. This is the test both with regard
							to large and small animals. If a small animal stretched out its foreleg
							at the end of the slaughtering but did not withdraw it, the
							slaughtering is invalid, for this was just an indication of the
							expiration of its life. When do these rules apply? To case of an animal
							which was believed to be dying. But if it was believed to be sound,
							even though it did not show any of these signs, the slaughtering is
							valid.

							If one slaughtered for a non-Jew, the slaughtering is valid. Rabbi
							Eliezer declares it invalid. Rabbi Eliezer said: even if one
							slaughtered a beast with the intention that a non-Jew should eat only
							its liver, the slaughtering is invalid, for the thoughts of a non-Jew
							are usually directed towards idolatry. Rabbi Yose said: is there not a
							kal vehomer argument? For if in the case of consecrated animals, where
							a wrongful intention can render invalid, it is established that
							everything depends solely upon the intention of him who performs the
							service, how much more in the case of unconsecrated animals, where a
							wrongful intention cannot render invalid, is it not logical that
							everything should depend solely upon the intention of him who
							slaughters!

							If one slaughtered an animal as a sacrifice to mountains, hills, seas,

							slaughtering is invalid.

							One may not slaughter so that the blood runs into the sea or into

							of water. And when on board a ship on to vessels. One may not slaughter
							at all into a hole, but one may dig a hole in his own house for the
							blood to run into. In the street, however, he should not do so as not
							to follow the ways of the heretics.

							The following defects render cattle terefah:If the esophagus was

							it was torn to the extent of a handbreadth, and in a small animal the
							greater part. If the omasum (the third stomach of a ruminant) was
							pierced; Of if the second stomach was pierced on the outside; If the

							was mauled by a wolf Rabbi Judah says: small animals are terefah if
							mauled by a wolf, large cattle if mauled by a lion; small fowl if
							mauled by a hawk, large fowl if mauled by a falcon. This is the rule:

							If an animal was having difficulty giving birth and the fetus put forth

							slaughtered. If it put forth its head, even though it put it back in,
							it is considered as born. Whatever is cut off from the fetus within the
							womb and left inside may be eaten, but whatever is cut off from the
							spleen or kidneys of the animal and left inside may not be eaten. This
							is the rule: that which is from the body of the animal is forbidden,
							but that which is not from the body of the animal is permitted.

							If a fetus died within the womb of its mother and the shepherd put in

							animal. Rabbi Yose HaGalili says: if it was an unclean animal he is
							unclean, and if it was a clean animal he is clean. If the fetus of a
							woman died within the womb of its mother and the midwife put in her
							hand and touched it, the midwife is unclean for seven days, but the

							If an animal was having difficulty in labor and the fetus put forth its
							limb and a person immediately cut if off and then slaughtered the
							mother, the flesh of the fetus is clean. If he slaughtered the mother
							first and then cut if off, the flesh of the fetus is unclean like that
							which had touched nevelah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say,
							it is like that which had touched a slaughtered terefah, For just as we
							find that the slaughtering of a terefah animal renders it clean, so the
							slaughtering of the animal renders the limb clean. Rabbi Meir said to
							them: No, for when you say that the slaughtering of a terefah animal
							renders it clean you are concerned with the animal itself, but can you
							say that it will render clean the limb which is not part of the animal
							itself? From where do we learn that the slaughtering of a terefah
							animal renders it clean? For we could have argued to the contrary: An
							unclean animal may not be eaten, and a terefah also may not be eaten;
							just as slaughtering does not render an unclean animal clean so
							slaughtering should not render a terefah animal clean? No, if you said
							this of an unclean animal for at no time was it fit for slaughtering;
							can you also say this of a terefah animal which had a time when it was
							fit for slaughtering? Take away with this argument that you brought
							forth! For where would we know this of an animal that was born terefah
							from the womb? Substitute therefore this argument: No, if you said this
							of an unclean animal for none of its kind may be validly slaughtered;
							can you also state this of a terefah for whose kind there is valid
							slaughter? Accordingly, the slaughtering of a live eight months birth
							does not render it clean, since there is no slaughtering of its kind.

							If one slaughtered an animal and found in it an eight months’ fetus,
							either living or dead, or a dead nine months fetus, he need only tear
							it open and take out the blood. If he found in it a living nine months’
							fetus it must be slaughtered, and he would thereby possibly incur the
							penalty for “it and its young,” the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages
							say: the slaughtering of its mother renders it permitted. Rabbi Shimon
							Shezuri says: even if it is eights years old and is plowing the field,
							the slaughtering of its mother renders it permitted. If he ripped open
							the mother and found in it a living nine months fetus, it must be
							slaughtered, since its mother has not been slaughtered.

							If the hind legs of an animal were cut off below the joint, it is

							clean by the slaughtering; Otherwise it is not rendered clean by the
							slaughtering.

							are both valid, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes.
							If both animals were consecrated and they were slaughtered outside the

							If a person slaughtered an animal and it was found to be terefah, or if
							he slaughtered it as an offering to idols, or if he slaughtered the red
							cow, or an ox which was condemned to be stoned, or a heifer whose neck
							was to be broken: Rabbi Shimon exempts him from having transgressed the
							law of “it and its young”; But the sages make him liable. If a person
							slaughtered an animal and it became nevelah under his hand, or if he
							stabbed it, or tore away the organs of the throat, he does not thereby
							transgress the law of it and its young. If two people bought a cow and
							its young, he who bought first can slaughter first; but if the second
							preceded him, he holds his advantage. If a person slaughtered a cow and
							then two of its calves, he is liable for eighty lashes. If he
							slaughtered its two calves and then the cow, he is liable for forty
							lashes. If he slaughtered it and then its calf and then the calf's
							offspring, he is liable for eighty lashes. If he slaughtered it and
							then its calf's offspring and then the calf, he is liable for forty
							lashes. Symmachos says in the name of r. Meir: he is liable for eighty
							lashes. At four periods in the year he who sells a beast to another
							must inform him, “I sold today its mother to be slaughtered,” or “I
							sold today its young to be slaughtered,” and these are they: on the eve
							of the last day of the feast of Sukkot, on the eve of the first day of
							Pesah, on the eve of Shavuot, and on the eve of Rosh Hashanah.
							According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean, also on the eve of Yom Kippur, in
							the Galilee. Rabbi Judah says, this is so, only when there was no time
							in between the sales, but if there was time, he need not inform him.
							Rabbi Judah agrees that if he sold the mother to the bridegroom and the
							young to the bride, he must inform them of it, for it is certain that
							they will each slaughter on the same day.

							At these four periods a butcher can be compelled to slaughter against
							his will. Even if the ox was worth a thousand dinars and the purchaser
							has only paid a dinar, they can force the butcher to slaughter it.
							Therefore if the animal died, the loss is upon the purchaser. At other
							times of the year it is not so, therefore if the animal died, the loss
							is upon the seller.

							The law of “covering up the blood” applies both within the land of
							Israel and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and
							after it, It applies to unconsecrated animal, but not consecrated
							animals. It applies only to wild animals and birds, whether they are at
							one's disposal or not. It applies also to a koy, for it is an animal
							about which there is a doubt. It may therefore not be slaughtered on a
							festival; and if it was slaughtered on a festival one may not cover up

							slaughtered that which was unconsecrated inside the sanctuary or that
							which was consecrated outside, or if he slaughtered a wild animal or a
							bird that was condemned to be stoned: Rabbi Meir makes him liable to
							cover up the blood; But the sages make him exempt. If he slaughtered a

							stabbed it, or tore away the organs of the throat, he is exempt from

							If a deaf-mute, an imbecile or a minor slaughtered while others watched

							young”: if they slaughtered while others watched them, it is forbidden
							to slaughter after them the mother/young, But if they were alone: Rabbi
							Meir permits to slaughter after them the mother/young. But the rabbis
							forbid it. They agree, that if a person did slaughter after them, he

							If a person slaughtered a hundred wild animals in one place, one

							says: if he slaughtered a wild animal he should cover up its blood and
							then slaughter the bird and cover it up also. If a person slaughtered
							and did not cover up the blood and another person saw it, the other
							must cover it up. If he covered it up and it became uncovered, he need
							not cover it up again. If the wind covered it up, he must cover it up

							apply to a bird because it does not have a socket on its hip. It
							applies to a fetus. Rabbi Judah says: it does not apply to a fetus. And

							food-uncleanness, but not to make up the minimum quantity in order to
							convey nevelah-uncleanness. Similarly, if a man slaughtered an unclean
							animal for a Gentile and it still has convulsions, it can convey
							food-uncleanness, but it conveys nevelah-uncleanness only after it is
							dead, or its head has been chopped off. Scripture has thus made more
							cases that convey food-uncleanness than those that convey
							nevelah-uncleanness. Rabbi Judah says: if an olive’s bulk of dried-up
							meat was gathered in one place, one would thereby become liable for
							nevelah-uncleanness.

							In the following cases the skin is considered flesh: The skin of a

							the pudenda. The skin of a fetus. The skin beneath the fat tail. The
							skin of the gecko, the monitor, the lizard and the skink. Rabbi Judah
							says: the lizard is like the weasel. If any of these skins was tanned
							or trampled upon as much as was usual for tanning, it becomes clean,
							excepting the skin of a man. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the eight

							If he was flaying from the feet upwards, until the whole hide has been

							not by contact, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: neither
							by contact nor by carrying. Rabbi Akiva agrees that if there were two
							pieces of flesh, each the size of half of an olive, that he stuck on a
							twig and he waved them, he becomes unclean. Why then does Rabbi Akiva
							declare him clean in the case where they cling to the hide? Because the

							the slaughtering become susceptible to uncleanness, the words of Rabbi
							Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: they have not become susceptible to
							uncleanness. If the animal died, the hanging flesh must be rendered
							susceptible to uncleanness. The limb is unclean as a limb severed from
							a living creature, but is not unclean as the limb of a nevelah
							(carcass), the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon declares it clean.

							must not give it to him. But if the first born was blemished and the

							If one makes a slit in the ear of a firstborn animal, he may never

							its long wool hanging down and asked: what is the meaning of this? They
							replied: “It is a first born and is not to be slaughtered until it has
							a blemish,” The quaestor took a dagger and slit its ear. The matter
							came before the sages and they permitted it. After they had permitted,
							he went and sliced the ears of other first borns. The sages forbade
							them. Once children were once playing in a field. They tied the tails
							of sheep one to the other and one tail which belonged to a first born
							was severed. The matter came before the rabbis and they permitted the
							first born. When the children saw that they had permitted the first
							born to be slaughtered, they proceeded to tie the tails of other first
							borns. The sages forbade the other first borns. This is the rule:
							wherever the blemish is caused with the knowledge and consent of the
							owner it is forbidden, but, if it is not with his knowledge and
							consent, it is permitted.

							from a field sufficiently watered by rain it is a permanent blemish, if
							not cured. If it ate fresh fodder and then dry fodder from a field
							requiring artificial irrigation, or if it ate dry fodder first and then
							fresh fodder from field watered by rain it is not a blemish unless it

							There is one who is counted as a firstborn with respect to inheritance
							but not with respect to redemption from a priest; a firstborn with
							respect to redemption from a priest but not a firstborn with respect to
							inheritance; a firstborn with respect to both inheritance and
							redemption from a priest; and a firstborn in respect to neither
							inheritance nor redemption from a priest. Which is a firstborn with
							respect to inheritance but not to redemption from a priest? One which
							follows one which was not viable whose head came forth alive, or one
							born in the ninth month whose head came out dead, or when a woman
							aborts something that looks like an animal, beast or bird, the words of
							Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: it is not considered an opening of the
							womb until the abortion has the form of a human being. If a woman
							aborts a sandal or a placenta or a fetus having an articulated shape,
							or if an embryo came out by pieces, the infant which follows after them
							is a first-born with respect to inheritance but not a first-born for
							redemption from a priest. If one who never had children married a woman
							who had already given birth, even if she had given birth when she was a
							slave but is now free, or had given birth when she was a non-Jew but
							has since converted, if after coming to the Israelite she gave birth,
							the infant is considered a first-born with respect to inheritance but
							not a first-born for redemption from a priest. Rabbi Yose the Galilean
							says: the infant is a firstborn with respect to inheritance and for
							redemption from a priest, as it says: “Whatever opens the womb in
							Israel” (Exodus 13:2), meaning only if it opens the womb in Israel. If
							one had children already and married a woman who had never given birth
							previously Or if she converted when pregnant, or if she was freed when
							pregnant, and she gave birth; If she and a priestess gave birth, she
							and a Levite’s daughter, she and a woman who had already given birth;
							And similarly if a woman who did not wait three months after her
							husband's death, married and gave birth and it is not known if the
							infant was born in the ninth month since the death of the first husband
							or in the seventh month since she married the second, it is a firstborn
							for redemption from a priest but not a first-born with respect to
							inheritance. Which is a firstborn both in respect of inheritance and
							for redemption from a priest? If a woman miscarries a sac full of blood
							or full of water or full of pieces of flesh; or if a woman miscarries
							something with the shape of fish or locusts or reptiles, or creeping
							things, or if she discharges on the fortieth day of conception, the
							infant which follows after these discharges is a firstborn both in
							respect of inheritance and for redemption from a priest.

							told that he was not redeemed. If both he and his son need to be

							The law concerning the tithe of cattle is in force in the Land and

							tithed together. To the new and the old, but they are not tithed
							together. Now it might be logical: seeing that new and old animals
							which are not treated as kilayim in regard to one another are yet not
							tithed one for the other, lambs and goats which are treated as kilyaim
							in regard to one another, all the more should not be tithed one for the

							All domesticated animals enter the shed to be tithed except kilayim, a
							terefah, offspring brought forth by means of a caesarean section, an
							animal too young for sacrifice, and an “orphan”. And what is an
							“orphan”? When its mother has died during its birth or was slaughtered
							and subsequently gave birth. But Rabbi Joshua says: even if the mother
							has been killed, if the hide is still intact the offspring is not an
							‘orphan’ animal.

							There are three periods lit. threshing floors for the tithe of cattle:
							in the peras of Pesah, in the peras of Atzeret (Shavuot) and in the
							peras of the Feast of Sukkot, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai says:
							on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan and on the
							twenty-ninth of Av. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the first of
							Nisan, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. And why
							did they say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishrei?
							Because it is a Yom Tov and you cannot tithe on a Yom Tov. Consequently
							they moved it up to the twenty-ninth of Elul. Rabbi Meir says: the
							first of Elul is the New Year for the tithe of cattle. Ben Azzai says:
							those born in Elul are tithed by themselves.

							All those born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul
							combine for matters of tithing. Five lambs born before Rosh Hashanah
							and five born after Rosh Hashanah do not combine. But five lambs born
							before the period of tithing and five after the period of tithing do
							combine for tithing. If so, why did they speak of three periods for the
							tithe of cattle? Until the arrival of the tithing period it is
							permitted to sell and slaughter the animals, but when the period has
							arrived he must not kill, but if he killed, he is exempt.

							How does one tithe animals? He brings them to a shed and makes for them
							a small opening so that two cannot go out at the same time. And he
							counts them with a rod: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
							nine. And the one that comes out tenth he marks with red chalk and he
							says: “Behold, this is the tithe.” If he did not mark it, or if he did
							not count them with a rod, or if he counted them while they were
							crouching or standing, they are still considered tithed. If he had one
							hundred lambs and he took ten or if he had ten and he took one without
							counting, this is not a valid tithe. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: this is
							a valid tithe. If one of the lambs already counted jumped back into the
							flock in the shed they are all exempt. If one of the lambs that was a
							tithe jumped back into the flock in the shed, they all go to pasture
							until they become unfit for sacrifice, and the owners may eat them in
							their unfit state.

							If two lambs came out at the same time, he counts them in pairs. If he
							counted the two as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled. If the
							ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth
							are spoiled. If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and
							the eleventh the tenth, all three are holy: the ninth can be eaten when
							it becomes blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is
							sacrificed as a shelamim, and it can make a substitute, the words of
							Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah said: can one substitute make another
							substitute? They said in the name of Rabbi Meir: if it were a
							substitute, it would not have been sacrificed. If he called the ninth
							the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh
							is not holy. The following is the rule: wherever the name of the tenth
							animal has not been taken away from it, the eleventh is not
							consecrated.

							bring the sacrifices of a rich man. Rabbi says: I say the same applies
							with regard to an evaluation. Why is a poor man who evaluated a rich
							man obliged to pay only the evaluation of a poor man? Because the rich
							man is not obligated at all. But if the rich man said: “My value is
							upon me” and the poor man, hearing that, said: “What this man has said,
							I take upon myself,” then he must pay the evaluation of a rich man. If
							he was poor and then became rich, or rich and then became poor, he must

							One who said: “I vow my weight,” he must pay his weight, in silver if
							he had said in silver, or in gold if he had said in gold. It happened
							with the mother of Yirmatia, who said, “I vow my daughter's weight.”
							She went up to Jerusalem and weighed her and then paid her weight in
							gold. If a man said: “I vow the weight of my hand,” Rabbi Judah says:
							let him fill a barrel with water and put it his hand in up to the
							elbow. Then let him weigh the flesh, bones and sinews of a donkey and
							put it into the barrel until it is filled up again. Rabbi Yose said:
							“But how is it possible to account exactly one kind of flesh against
							another kind of flesh, and one kind of bones against another kind of

							If one said “The worth of my hand is upon me,” they estimate his worth

							vows of worth are more stringent than vows of value. There is an aspect
							of vows of value that is more stringent than vows of worth. How so? If
							one said: “My value is upon me” and then he dies, his heirs must pay
							it. But if he said: “My worth is upon me,” and then he dies, his heirs
							need not pay anything because dead persons have no worth. If he said,
							“The value of my hand or foot is upon me,” he has said nothing, But if
							he said, “The value of my head is upon me,” he must pay his whole
							value. This is the general rule: Anything upon which his life depends,

							says: when he divorces her he must vow that he will not derive any
							further benefit from her. Rabbi Joshua says: he need not do so.
							Similarly, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: Also if one guarantees a

							for the sowing of a homer of barley. If the field contained ravines ten
							handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, they are not included
							as part of the field. But if less than this, they are included. If he
							consecrated it two or three years before the Jubilee, he must pay one

							A man may proscribe part of his flock or of his herd, of his Canaanite

							belongings, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: the priests
							cannot proscribe, because things proscribed belong to them. But Levites
							can proscribe, because things proscribed do not belong to them. Rabbi
							says: the words of Rabbi Judah seem acceptable in cases of immovable
							property as it is said: “For that is their perpetual possession,”
							(Leviticus 25:34) and the words of Rabbi Shimon seem acceptable in
							cases of movable property, since things proscribed do not fall to them.

							proscribed without specification fall to the fund for Temple repairs,
							as it was said: “Every proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord”
							(Leviticus 27:25). But the sages say: things proscribed without
							specification go to the priests, as it is said: “As a field proscribed:
							its possession belongs to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). If so, why is
							it said: “Every proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord”? This
							teaches that it applies to most holy and less holy things.

							If one sold his field of possession at the time when the Jubilee was in
							force, he may not redeem it for two years, as it says: “According to
							the number of the years of the crops he shall sell to you” (Leviticus
							25:15). If there was a year of blight or mildew, or a seventh year, it
							is not included in the count. If he only broke the ground without
							planting or left it fallow for a year, that year is included in the
							count. Rabbi Elazar says: if he sold it to him before Rosh Hashanah
							year, and it was still full of fruit, he enjoys three crops in two
							years.

							sold it to the first for two hundred, and the first sold it to the
							second for one hundred, then he need reckon only with the second, as it
							says: “With the man” (ibid) the man in possession of the field. One may
							not sell a distant field in order to redeem a near one, or a poor field
							in order to redeem a good one. One may not borrow money in order to
							redeem, nor redeem it in halves. But in the case of objects consecrated
							all these things are permitted. In this respect the laws concerning a

							If one sold a house among the houses of a walled city, he may redeem it
							at once and at any time during twelve months. This is a kind of
							interest, yet it is not interest. If the seller died, his son may
							redeem it. If the purchaser died, it may be redeemed from his son. One
							counts the year only from the time that he sold it, as it is said,
							“Before a full year has elapsed” (Leviticus 25:30). When it says a “a
							full” year the extra month is included. Rabbi says: he is allowed a

							last day of the twelve months, so that the house might become his

							All persons can substitute, both men and women. Not that one is
							permitted to substitute, but that if one did so, the substitute is
							sacred, and he receives forty lashes. Priests have the power to
							substitute their own animal and Israelites also have the power to
							substitute their own animal. Priests do not have the power to
							substitute a hatat, an asham or a first-born: Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri:
							what is the reason priests do not have the power to substitute a
							first-born? Rabbi Akiva said: a hatat and an asham are priestly gifts
							and a first-born is also a priestly gift. Just as in the case of a
							hatat and an asham priests have no power to substitute them, so in the
							case of a first-born priests have no power to substitute it. Rabbi
							Yohanan ben Nuri said to him: So what that priests should have no power
							to substitute a hatat and an asham, for there they have do not have a
							claim on these offerings while they are alive. How can you say that the
							same applies to a first-born upon which the priests do have a claim
							when it is alive? Rabbi Akiva replied to him: Has not Scripture already
							said: “Then it and its substitute shall be holy? ” (Leviticus 27:10).
							Now where does the holiness of the original animal occur? In the house
							of the owners; so too the substitution occurs in the house of the
							owners.

							may not exchange or substitute another for it, either good for bad, or
							bad for good” (Leviticus 27:10). What is meant by “good for bad”?
							Blemished animals whose dedication was prior to their blemish. One can
							substitute one hullin animal for two consecrated animals, and two
							hullin animals for one consecrated animal; One hullin animal for a
							hundred consecrated animals and a hundred hullin animals for one
							consecrated animal; Rabbi Shimon says: one can only substitute one for
							one, as it says, “Then it and its substitute” (ibid), just as “it” the

							but whole animals of hullin cannot be substitute for them. Rabbi Yose
							said: When it comes to dedicating animals, is it not true that if one
							says: “This foot shall be an olah (a burnt offering),” the whole animal
							becomes an olah? Similarly, if one says, “This foot shall be in place

							is responsible for them and their libations, whereas for congregational

							although they are liable for their libations once the sacrifice has
							been offered. There are laws relating to congregational sacrifices
							which do not apply to the sacrifices of individuals: For congregational
							sacrifices override Shabbat and the laws of ritual impurity, whereas
							sacrifices of individuals do not override the Shabbat or the laws of
							ritual impurity. Rabbi Meir said: but do not the griddle cakes of a

							If one set aside a female animal for an olah and it gave birth to a

							female animal for an asham, it goes out to pasture until it becomes
							unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and with its money he brings an
							asham. If he has already offered an asham in its place, its money goes
							for freewill-offerings. Rabbi Shimon says: it is sold without waiting
							for a blemish. The substitute of an asham, the young of its substitute,
							their young and the young of their young until the end of time, go out
							to pasture until unfit for sacrifice. They are then sold and their
							money goes for a freewill-offering. Rabbi Eliezer says: they are left

							through another animal goes out to pasture until unfit for sacrifice.

							hatat of a bird that is brought for a doubt is burned. Rabbi Judah
							says: it is cast into the sewer. All things which must be buried must
							not be burned, and all things which must be burned must not be buried.
							Rabbi Judah says: if one wishes to be stringent with himself, to burn
							things which are buried, he is permitted to do so. They said to him: he
							is not allowed to change.

							There are in the Torah thirty-six transgressions which are punishable
							with karet:When one has intercourse with his mother, His father's wife;
							Or his daughter-in-law; When a man has intercourse with a male, Or with
							a beast, Or when a woman brings a beast upon herself; When one has
							intercourse with a woman and her daughter; Or with a married woman; Or
							with his sister; Or with his father's sister; Or his mother's sister;
							Or his wife's sister; Or his brother's wife; Or the wife of his
							father's brother; Or with a menstruating woman; One who blasphemes the
							Lord; One who worships idols; Or dedicates his children to Molech; Or
							has a ba’al ov; Or desecrates the Shabbat; When an unclean person eats
							of sacred food; Or when one enters the precincts of the Temple in an
							unclean state; When one eats forbidden fat, Or blood; Notar; Or piggul;
							When one slaughters Or offers up a consecrated animal outside the
							Temple; One who eats anything leavened on Pesah; One who eats Or works
							on Yom Kippur; One who compounds the oil of anointing; Or compounds
							incense; Or uses unlawfully oil of anointing; And when one transgresses
							the laws of the pesah, And circumcision from among positive
							commandments.

							For these transgressions one is liable to karet if committed
							intentionally, and if committed unwittingly to a hatat. If there is a
							doubt whether he had committed the transgression to an asham talui,
							except in the case of one who defiled the Temple or its consecrated
							things, for in that case one is liable in this case to a sliding-scale
							sacrifice, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: also the
							blasphemer is an exception, as it says: “You shall have one law for one
							that acts in error” (Numbers 15:29), this excludes the blasphemer who
							performs no action.

							Some women after childbirth bring an offering which is eaten; some

							bring an offering which is eaten: If a woman miscarries a fetus which

							Meir; but the sages say: only if it has a human shape. Or if a woman
							miscarries a sandal-like fetus or a placenta or a fully formed fetus,

							If a woman miscarries on the eve of the eighty-first day: Bet Shammai
							say: she is exempted from an offering. But Bet Hillel say: she is
							liable. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai: what is the difference between
							the eve of the eighty-first day and the eighty-first day itself? Since
							these are considered equal with regard to blood uncleanness, why should
							they not be considered equal also with reference to the offerings? Bet
							Shammai said to them: No; if you said this in the case where she
							miscarries on the eighty-first day where it occurred at a time when she
							was fit to bring an offering, can you say this where she miscarries on
							the eve of the eighty-first day, where it did not occur at a time when
							she was fit to bring an offering? Bet Hillel said to them: the case of
							a woman who miscarries on the eighty-first day which fell on a Shabbat
							shall prove it, where it did not take place at a time when she was fit
							to bring an offering and yet she is liable to bring a new offering. Bet
							Shammai said to them: No; if you says this of the eighty-first day
							which fell on a Shabbat for although it is not fit for offerings of an
							individual, it is at least fit for communal offerings, would you
							maintain this concerning a woman who miscarries on the eve of the
							eighty-first day, seeing that the night is fit neither for offerings of
							the individual nor for communal offerings? As to your argument of the
							uncleanness of the blood, it proves nothing, for if she aborted within
							the period of cleanness the blood is unclean, and yet she is exempted
							from an offering.

							There are four persons who require a ceremony of atonement, and there

							transgression. The following are those who require a ceremony of
							atonement: the zav, the zavah, the woman who gave birth and the
							metzora. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: also a convert is regarded as a
							person who still requires a ceremony of atonement until the blood has
							been sprinkled for him; the same applies to the nazirite with reference
							to wine, haircutting and uncleanness.

							There are five persons who bring one sacrifice for multiple

							value. The following bring one sacrifice for multiple
							transgressions:One who has intercourse with a female slave several
							times, A nazirite who became unclean several times. One who warns his
							wife in regard to several men, And a metzora who has contracted skin
							disease several times. If he has offered the birds and then contracted
							the disease again, they do not count for him until he has offered his
							hatat. Rabbi Judah says: until he has offered his asham.

							A woman who has had several births. If she miscarried a female within
							eighty days of the birth of a girl, and then she again miscarried a
							female within eighty days of the previous miscarriage; or if she
							miscarried twins. Rabbi Judah says: she brings an offering for the
							first and not for the second, for the third again but not for the
							fourth. The following persons bring an offering of higher or lesser
							value: One who hears the voice (see Leviticus 5:1); One who has broken
							the word of his lips (Leviticus 5:4); One who while unclean has entered
							the sanctuary or has partaken of holy things, A woman after childbirth
							And a metzora. What is the difference between intercourse with a female
							slave and the other forbidden sexual relations? For they are not
							equivalent in regard to the punishment nor the sacrifice. In the case
							of all other forbidden sexual relations a hatat is brought, in that of
							a female slave an asham; In the case of the other forbidden sexual
							relations a female animal is brought, in that of the female slave a
							male; In the case of the other forbidden sexual relations man and woman
							are alike with respect to lashes and the sacrifice; in that of the
							female slave the man is unlike the woman regarding the lashes, and the
							woman is unlike the man regarding the sacrifice. In the case of all
							other forbidden sexual relations sexual contact is punishable as well
							as consummation, and one is liable for each act of intercourse
							separately. For in this the case of the female slave is more stringent
							in that intentional transgression is of the same status as unwitting
							transgression.

							Rabbi Ishmael says: to a full female slave. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria
							says: all other forbidden sexual relations are stated explicitly, and
							of the remainder there is only one who can be half a slave and half a

							If they said to him: you ate forbidden fat, he is liable to a hatat; If
							one witness says: he ate, and another says: he did not eat, or if one
							woman says, he ate, and another says, he did not eat, he is liable to
							an asham talui. If one witness says, he ate, and he himself says, I did
							not eat, he is exempt. If two witnesses say, he ate, and he himself
							says, I did not eat: Rabbi Meir says he is liable. Rabbi Meir said: if
							two witnesses are capable of bringing upon him severe penalty of death,
							can they not impose the less severe punishment of a sacrifice? They
							replied: suppose he said, I did it intentionally, would he not be
							exempted?

							If one twice ate forbidden fat in one spell of unawareness, he is

							an instance where different kinds of food are more stringent than one
							kind. In the following instance, however, one kind of food is more
							stringent than several kinds: if one ate half an olive-size and then
							again half an olive-size, both in one spell of unawareness, if of one
							kind he is liable, if of two kinds, he is exempted.

							Within what time must he eat them for him to be liable? The time he
							would need if he ate a similar amount of parched grains of corn, the
							words of Rabbi Meir. But the rabbis say: he must take from the
							beginning to the end of his eating no more time than is required for
							the eating of a peras (a half a loaf of bread) to be liable. If one
							eats unclean food or drinks unclean drinks, or if he drinks a quarter
							of a log of wine and then enters the Temple he is liable if it takes
							less time than it takes to eat a peras. Rabbi Elazar says: if the
							drinking was interrupted or if he diluted it, he is exempt.

							It is possible that by one act of eating a person could become liable

							which was at the same time notar of an offering, and it was on Yom

							is liable to yet another hatat. But they said to him: this is a

							By one act of intercourse one may become liable for six hatats: If one
							had intercourse with his daughter, he can be guilty of incest with her
							because she is his daughter, his sister, his brother's wife, the wife
							of his father's brother, and he can also be guilty of intercourse with
							a married woman and a menstruant. If one had intercourse with his
							daughter’s daughter he can be guilty of incest with her because she is
							his daughter's daughter, his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, the
							wife of his father's brother, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a
							menstruant. Rabbi Yose said: if the grandfather transgressed and
							married her first, he may thereby become guilty for offending with his
							father's wife. So too, if one had intercourse with his wife's daughter
							or her daughter's daughter.

							one had intercourse with the mother of his father-in-law or of his
							mother-in-law. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: if one had intercourse with
							his mother-in-law he may thereby become guilty for having relations
							with his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother
							of his father-in-law. They said to him: all these three are the same

							Rabbi Akiva said: I asked Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua at the

							feast of Rabban Gamaliel's son: What is the law concerning a man who
							had intercourse with his sister, his father's sister and his mother's
							sister? Is he liable for one sacrifice for all of them, or to one
							separate sacrifice for each of them? They replied: we have heard
							nothing about this, but we have heard that if one had intercourse with
							five menstruants in one spell of unawareness, he is liable to a
							sacrifice for each act, and it seems to us that the case you asked
							about may be derived by an a fortiori conclusion (kal vehomer).

							Rabbi Akiva further asked: If a limb hangs loose from the body of a
							living beast, what is the law? They replied: We have heard nothing
							about this, but we have heard about a limb hanging loose from the body
							of a man, that it is clean. And thus those that were afflicted with
							boils used to do in Jerusalem. He would go on the eve of Pesah to the
							doctor, and he would cut the limb until only contact of a hairbreadth
							was left; he then stuck it on a thorn and then tore himself away from
							it. In this manner both that man and the physician could make their
							pesah offering. And it seems to us that your case may be derived from
							this by a kal vehomer.

							Rabbi Akiba asked again: If a man slaughtered five sacrifices outside
							the Temple in one spell of unawareness, what is the law? Is he liable
							to a separate offering for each act or only to one for them all? They
							replied: we have heard nothing about this. Rabbi Joshua: I have heard
							that if one eats an offering from five different dishes in one spell of
							unawareness, he is guilty of sacrilege for each of them; and it seems
							to me that the case in question may be inferred from this by a kal
							vehomer. Rabbi Shimon said: Rabbi Akiba did not ask this, but rather
							concerning one who ate of notar (remnant) from five sacrifices in one
							spell of unawareness what is the law? Is he liable only to one offering
							for all of them, or is he liable to one for each of them? They replied:
							we have heard nothing about this. Rabbi Joshua: I have heard that if
							one eats an offering from five different dishes in one spell of
							unawareness, he is guilty of sacrilege for each of them; and it seems
							to me that the case in question may be inferred from this by a kal
							vehomer. Rabbi Akiba replied: if this is a received tradition we accept
							it; but if it is only a logical deduction, there is a rebuttal. He
							Rabbi Joshua said: rebut it. He replied: It is not so. For if you hold
							the view with regard to sacrilege, for in this case one who gives food
							to another is as guilty as the one who eats it himself, and the person
							who causes others to derive a benefit from them is as guilty as the
							person who himself made use of them; furthermore, small quantities are
							reckoned together in the case of sacrilege even after the lapse of a
							long period, can you say it in connection with notar (remnant) where
							not one of these laws applies.

							If a person was in doubt whether he had eaten forbidden fat or not, or
							even if he had certainly eaten of it but was in doubt as to whether it
							had the requisite quantity or less; or if there were before him
							permitted fat as well as forbidden fat, and he ate of one of them and
							does not know of which of them he ate; Or if his wife and his sister
							were with him in the house and he unwittingly had sex with one of them
							and does not know with which of them he unwittingly had sex; Or if he
							did forbidden labor and does not know whether it was on Shabbat or on a

							Just as a person who ate forbidden fat twice in one spell of

							is in doubt, he is liable to only one asham talui. If in the meantime
							he became aware of the possible sin he is liable to a separate asham
							talui for each act, just as he would in similar circumstances be liable
							to a separate hatat for each act. Just as one is liable to separate
							hatats if he ate, in one spell of unawareness, forbidden fat and blood
							and piggul and notar, so, too, when the transgression is in doubt, he
							is liable to an asham talui for each different act. If both forbidden
							fat and notar lay before a person and he ate one of them but does not
							know which; Or if his menstruant wife and his sister were with him in
							his house and he has sex unwittingly with one of them and does not know
							with which, Or if Shabbat and Yom Kippur followed each other and he did
							forbidden work at twilight and does not know on which day: Rabbi
							Eliezer declares him liable to a hatat; But Rabbi Joshua exempts him.
							Rabbi Yose said: they did not dispute about a person that did work at
							twilight, for he is certainly exempt, for I may assume that part of the
							work was done on the one day and part on the following day. About what
							did they dispute? About one who did work during the day itself but he
							did not know whether he did it on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, or if he
							did work and did not know what manner of work he did: Rabbi Eliezer
							declares him liable to a hatat; But Rabbi Joshua exempts him. Rabbi

							Rabbi Akiva declares one liable to an asham talui for sacrilege; But

							his restitution money until he becomes aware of his trespass, when he
							must bring with it a certain asham. Rabbi Tarfon: Why should he bring
							two ashams? Rather, let him set aside the principal with an added
							fifth, and bring an asham the value of two sela's and stipulate: “If I
							did commit sacrilege, here is my restitution and this my asham; and if
							the sacrilege was doubtful, let the money be a freewill gift and the
							offering an asham talui;” since the same type of sacrifice he brings
							for a case where he doesn’t know, he brings for one where he does know.

							Rabbi Akiba: Your words seem plausible in the case of a minor amount of
							sacrilege; but if it was a case of doubtful sacrilege of a hundred
							manehs, would it not be more advantageous for him to bring an asham for
							two sela's rather than restore out of doubt the sum of a hundred
							manehs? Rabbi Akiba agrees with Rabbi Tarfon in the case of a minor
							amount of sacrilege. If a woman brought a bird hatat for a case of a
							doubtful miscarriage, and prior to the pinching of its neck she learned
							that the birth was a certainty, she can offer it as a certain hatat,
							for that which she offers in the case of certainty is of the same kind
							as that which she offers in the case of doubt.

							If a person brought an asham talui and then found out that he did not

							the money goes for freewill-offerings. Rabbi Eliezer says: it shall be
							offered up, for if it does not expiate this sin, it will expiate
							another sin. If he learns of it after it was slaughtered, the blood
							shall be spilled out and the flesh is removed to the place of burning.
							If the blood had already been tossed onto the altar, the flesh may be
							eaten. Rabbi Yose says: even if the blood is still in the vessel, it

							different regarding an ox to be stoned: If before it was stoned, it may
							go out to pasture among the flock; If after it was stoned, it is
							permitted for use. The law is also different regarding the heifer whose
							neck is to be broken: If before its neck was broken, it may go out to
							pasture among the flock. If after its neck was broken, it shall be
							buried on the spot, for it was from the outset brought in a matter of
							doubt, it has atoned for the doubt, and so has served its purpose.

							at any time he pleases and such a sacrifice is called the asham of the
							pious. They said of Bava ben Buti that he used to freely offer an asham
							talui every day, except on the day after Yom Kippur. He declared: By
							this temple! Had they allowed me, I would have offered one even then,
							but they said to me, wait until you have come to a state of doubt.” But
							the sages say one may not bring an asham talui except for a sin that is
							punished by karet when done intentionally and for which one brings a
							hatat when done unwittingly.

							choicer, therefore Scripture states, “A young pigeon or a turtle-dove
							for a hatat,” (Leviticus 12:6) to teach that both are equal. The father
							comes before the mother in all places. You might think that it is

							have said: the father comes before the mother in all places, because

							Most holy sacrifices which were slaughtered on the south side of the

							whatever has at some time been permitted to the priests is not subject

							If it was loose he may use it and therefore if he spent it he is not
							guilty of sacrilege. If the money was deposited with a private person,

							he has spent all that was in the bag.

							In three places the priests keep watch in the Temple: in the chamber of
							Avtinas, in the chamber of the spark, and in the fire chamber. In the
							chamber of Avtinas and in the chamber of the spark there were upper
							chambers where the youths kept watch. The fire chamber was vaulted and
							it was a large room surrounded with stone projections, and the elders
							of the clan serving in the Temple used to sleep there, with the keys of
							the Temple courtyard in their hands. The priestly initiates used to
							place their bedding on the ground. They did not sleep in their sacred
							garments, but they used to take them off and fold them and place them
							under their heads and cover themselves with their own ordinary clothes.
							If one of them had a seminal emission, he used to go out and make his
							way down the winding stairs which went under the Birah, and which was
							lit by lights on each side until he reached the bathing place. There
							was a fire close by and an honorable seat i.e. toilet: and this was its
							honor: if he found it locked, he knew there was someone there; if it
							was open, he knew there was no one there. He would go down and bathe
							and then come up and dry himself and warm himself in front of the fire.
							He would then go and take his seat next to his fellow priests until the
							gates were opened, when he would take his departure.

							The superintendent would come and knock and they would open for him,
							and he would say to them, let all who have bathed come and draw lots.
							So they drew lots, and whoever was successful.

							the shovels and the forks and went up to the top of the altar. The

							The priest who had won the right to slaughter the tamid takes it along

							were blocks of cedar wood, in which were fixed hooks of iron, three
							rows in each, upon which they would hang the tamid and they would strip
							its hide on tables of marble that stood between the pillars.

							Ezekiel, “And the Lord said to me, ‘This gate shall be closed, it shall
							not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the Lord God of Israel

							They would not tie up the lamb but rather they would string its legs

							it was strung up: its head was to the south while its face was turned
							to the west. The slaughterer stood to the east of it, facing the west.
							The morning tamid was killed by the north-western corner of the altar
							at the second ring. The evening tamid was killed by the north-eastern
							corner at the second ring. While one slaughtered another received the
							blood. He then proceeded to the north-eastern corner and cast the blood
							on the eastern and northern sides; he then proceeded to the
							southwestern corner and cast the blood on the western and southern
							sides. The remnant of the blood he poured out at the southern base of

							letekh. It had two chains; with one he used to draw it down, and with
							the other he used to hold it above so that it should not roll over. It
							was used for three purposes for placing over live coals, and over a

							If the high priest wished to burn the offerings himself, he would go up

							helped him up. The first of the other priests then handed to him the
							head and the foot and he laid his hands on them and threw them onto the
							altar. The second then handed to the first the two fore legs. And he
							handed them to the high priest who laid his hands on them and threw
							them onto the altar. The second then went away. In the same way all the
							other limbs were handed to him and he laid his hands on them and threw
							them on to the altar fire. If he wanted, he could lay his hands and let
							others throw them on the fire. He then went around the altar. From
							where did he begin? From the southeastern corner; from there he went to
							the northeastern, then to the northwestern and then to the
							southwestern. They there handed him the wine for libation. The deputy
							high priest stood on the corner/horn of the altar with the flags in his
							hand, and two priests on the table of the fats with two trumpets in
							their hands. They blew a teki’ah, a teru’ah and a teki’ah. They then
							went and stood by Ben Arza, one on his right hand and one on his left.
							When he bent down to make the libation the deputy high priest waved the
							flags and Ben Arza struck the cymbals and the Levites sang the psalm.
							When they came to a pause they blew a teki’ah, and the public bowed
							down. At every pause there was a teki’ah and at every teki’ah a bowing
							down. This was the order of the regular daily sacrifice for the service
							of our Lord. May it be His will that it be rebuilt speedily in our

							finished Tractate Tamid! It is a tradition at this point to thank God
							for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to
							going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that
							its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Tamid may have been
							one of the more unusual tractates that we have ever learned. Instead of
							disputes between sages, heaps of logic and laws, we get an intricate
							description of the Temple service. Indeed, although the language is
							clearly rabbinic Hebrew, its descriptive style is more characteristic
							of the Bible than of rabbinic literature. It is likely that these
							descriptions, or at least parts thereof, come from Temple times. They
							were preserved because the rabbis fervently hoped that the Temple would
							be rebuilt during their own lifetimes. While we may or may not share in
							this wish, I think we can all appreciate the respect in which they held
							this ceremony. Despite the fact that it was performed each and every
							day, twice every day, they don’t seem to have lost their sense of
							wonder at the intimate connection that they received with God through
							the sacrificial process. I hope you have enjoyed Tamid. Tomorrow we
							begin Tractate Middot (the last tractate in Seder Kodashim!).

							The courtyard of the women was a hundred and thirty-five cubits long by
							a hundred and thirty-five wide. It had four chambers in its four
							corners, each of which was forty cubits. They were not roofed, and so
							they will be in the time to come, as it says, “Then he brought me forth
							into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the
							court, and behold in every corner of the court there was a court. In
							the four corners of the court there were keturot courts” (Ezekiel
							46:21-22) and keturot means that they were not roofed. For what were
							they used? The southeastern one was the chamber of the Nazirites where
							the Nazirites used to boil their shelamim and shave their hair and
							throw it under the pot. The northeastern one was the wood chamber where
							priests with physical defects used to pick out the wood which had
							worms, every piece with a worm in it being unfit for use on the altar.
							The northwestern one was the chamber of those with skin disease. The
							southwestern one: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: I forget what it was
							used for. Abba Shaul says: they used to store there wine and oil, and
							it was called the chamber of oil. It the courtyard of the women had
							originally been smooth without protrusions in the walls but
							subsequently they surrounded it with a balcony so that the women could
							look on from above while the men were below, and they should not mix
							together. Fifteen steps led up from it to the courtyard of Israel,
							corresponding to the fifteen songs of ascents mentioned in the Book of
							Psalms, and upon which the Levites used to sing. They were not
							rectangular but circular like the half of a threshing floor.

							The altar was thirty-two cubits by thirty-two. It rose a cubit and went
							in a cubit, and this formed the foundation, leaving thirty cubits by
							thirty. It then rose five cubits and went in one cubit, and this formed
							the surround, leaving twenty-eight cubits by twenty-eight. The horns
							extended a cubit in each direction, thus leaving twenty-six by
							twenty-six. A cubit on every side was allowed for the priests to go
							round, thus leaving twenty-four by twenty-four as the place for the
							wood pile for the altar fire. Rabbi Yose said: Originally, the complete
							area occupied by the altar was only twenty-eight cubits by
							twenty-eight, and it rose with the dimensions mentioned until the space
							left for the altar pile was only twenty by twenty. When, however, the
							children of the exile returned, they added four cubits on the north,
							and four on the west like a gamma, since it is said: “Now the hearth
							shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square” (Ezekiel 43:16).
							Is it possible that it was only twelve cubits by twelve? When it says,
							“With four equal sides” (ibid), this shows that he was measuring from
							the middle, twelve cubits in every direction. A line of red paint ran
							round it in the middle to divide between the upper and the lower blood.
							The foundation ran the whole length of the north and of the west sides,
							and it took up one cubit on the south and one on the east.

							The stones both of the ascent and of the altar were taken from the

							whole stones on which no iron had been lifted, since iron disqualifies
							by mere touch, though a flaw made by anything could disqualify. If one
							of them received a flaw, it was disqualified, but the rest were not.
							They were whitewashed twice a year, once at Pesah and once at Hag, and
							the Sanctuary was whitewashed once a year, at Pesah. Rabbi says: they
							were whitewashed every Friday with a cloth on account of the blood
							stains. The plaster was not laid on with an iron trowel, for fear that
							it might touch and disqualify. Since iron was created to shorten man's
							days and the altar was created to prolong man's days, and it is not
							right therefore that that which shortens should be lifted against that
							which prolongs.

							they would hang the sacrifice and they would strip its hide on tables

							of Israel used to sit and judge the priesthood. A priest in whom was
							found a disqualification used to put on black garments and wrap himself
							in black and go away. One in whom no disqualification was found used to
							put on white garments and wrap himself in white and go in and serve
							along with his brother priests. They used to make a feast because no
							blemish had been found in the seed of Aaron the priest, and they used
							to say: Blessed is the Omnipresent, blessed is He, for no blemish has

							A bird hatat is performed below the red line, but a beast hatat is
							performed above the red line. A bird olah is performed above, but a
							beast olah below. If he changed this procedure with either, then the
							offering is disqualified. The seder ordered ritual in the case of
							kinnim is as follows: In the case of obligatory offerings, one bird is
							a hatat and one an olah. In the case of vows and freewill offerings,
							however, all are olot. What constitutes a vow? When one says: "It is
							incumbent upon me to bring an olah." And what constitutes a
							freewill-offering? When one says: "Behold, this shall be an olah." What
							is the practical difference between vows and freewill offerings? In the
							case of vows, if they die or are stolen, one is responsible for their
							replacement; But in the case of freewill offerings, if they die or are
							stolen, one is not responsible for their replacement.

							among the obligatory offerings. Similarly, if an olah becomes mixed up
							with unassigned obligatory bird offerings, the only ones that are valid
							are those that correspond to the number of olot among the obligatory
							offerings This rule holds true whether the unassigned obligatory
							offerings are in the majority and the freewill-offerings in the

							are obligatory in the minority, or whether they are both equal in

							If a woman says: "I vow a pair of birds if I give birth to a male

							If she had expressly defined her vow, then must she bring three other
							birds. This is so if the birds were of the same kind. If they were of

							said: This is what it meant when they said: "When the beast is alive it
							possesses one sound, but when it is dead its sound is sevenfold." In
							what way is its sound sevenfold? Its two horns are made into two
							trumpets, its two leg-bones into two flutes, its hide into a drum, its
							entrails for lyres and its large intestines for harp strings; and there
							are some who add that its wool is used for the blue pomegranates. Rabbi
							Shimon ben Akashiah says: ignorant old people, the older they become,
							the more their intellect gets befuddled, as it is said: "He removes the
							speech of men of trust and takes away the sense of the elders." But
							when it comes to aged scholars, it is not so. On the contrary, the
							older they get, the more their mind becomes composed, as it is said:
							"With aged men comes wisdom, and understanding in length of days."

							The fathers of impurity are a: sheretz, semen, an Israelite who has
							contracted corpse impurity, a metzora during the days of his counting,
							and the waters of purification whose quantity is less than the minimum
							needed for sprinkling. Behold, these convey impurity to people and
							vessels by contact and to earthenware by presence within their
							airspace, But they do not convey impurity by being carried.

					-
						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 1: Mishnah 2
					-
						-
							Above them are nevelah and waters of purification whose quantity is
							sufficient to be sprinkled, for these convey impurity to a person even
							by being carried so that he in turn conveys impurity to clothing by
							contact. Clothing, however, is free from impurity where there was
							contact alone.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 1: Mishnah 3

							Above them is one who had intercourse with a menstruant, for he defiles
							the bottom bedding upon which he lies as he does the top bedding. Above
							them is the issue of a zav, his spit, his semen and his urine, and the
							blood of a menstruant, for they convey impurity both by contact and by
							carrying. Above them is an object on which one can ride, for it conveys
							impurity even when it lies under a heavy stone. Above the object on
							which one can ride is that on which one can lie, for contact is the
							same as its carrying. Above the object on which one can lie is the zav,
							for a zav conveys impurity to the object on which he lies, while the
							object on which he lies cannot convey the same impurity to that upon
							which it lies.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 1: Mishnah 4

							Above the zav is the zavah, for she conveys impurity to the man who has
							intercourse with her. Above the zavah is the metzora, for he conveys
							impurity by entering into a house. Above the metzora is a human bone
							the size of a barley grain, for it conveys impurity for seven days.
							More strict than all these is a corpse, for it conveys impurity by ohel
							(tent) whereby all the others convey no impurity.

							There are ten grades of impurity that emanate from a person:A person
							before the offering of his obligatory sacrifices is forbidden to eat
							holy things but permitted to eat terumah and second tithe. If he is a
							tevul yom he is forbidden to eat holy things and terumah but permitted
							to eat second tithe. If he emitted semen he is forbidden to eat any of
							the three. If he had intercourse with a menstruant he defiles the
							bottom bedding upon which he lies as he does the top bedding. If he is
							a zav who has seen two discharges he conveys impurity to that on which
							he lies or sits and is required to undergo immersion in running water,
							but he is exempt from the sacrifice. If he saw three discharges he must
							bring the sacrifice. If he is a metzora that was only enclosed he
							conveys impurity by entry into an ohel but is exempt from loosening his
							hair, from rending his clothes, from shaving and from the birds
							offering. But if he was a confirmed metzora, he is liable for all
							these. If a limb on which there was not the proper quantity of flesh
							was severed from a person, it conveys impurity by contact and by
							carriage but not by ohel. But if it has the proper quantity of flesh it
							conveys impurity by contact, by carriage and by ohel. A "proper
							quantity of flesh" is such as is capable of healing. Rabbi Judah says:
							if in one place it has flesh sufficient to surround it with the
							thickness of a thread of the woof it is capable of healing.

							The area within the wall of Jerusalem is holier, for it is there that
							lesser holy things and second tithe may be eaten. The Temple Mount is
							holier, for zavim, zavot, menstruants and women after childbirth may
							not enter it. The chel is holier, for neither non-Jews nor one who
							contracted corpse impurity may enter it. The court of women is holier,
							for a tevul yom may not enter it, though he is not obligated a hatat
							for doing so. The court of the Israelites is holier, for a man who has
							not yet offered his obligatory sacrifices may not enter it, and if he
							enters he is liable for a hatat. The court of the priests is holier,
							for Israelites may not enter it except when they are required to do so:
							for laying on of the hands, slaying or waving.

							Vessels of wood, vessels of leather, vessels of bone or vessels of

							them into vessels they are susceptible to impurity henceforth. Earthen
							vessels and vessels of sodium carbonate are equal in respect of

							As regards the smallest earthen vessels, and the bottoms and sides of
							the larger but broken vessels that can stand unsupported: The
							prescribed size is a capacity to hold oil sufficient for the anointing
							of a little finger of a child if their former capacity was that of a
							log. If their former capacity was from one log to a se'ah their present
							capacity must be a quarter of a log. If it was from a se'ah to two
							se'ah it must be half a log. If from two se'ah to three se'ah or as
							much as five se'ah it must be a log, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi
							Akiva says: I do not prescribe any size for the unbroken vessels,
							rather: as regards the smallest earthen vessels, and the bottoms and
							sides of larger but broken ones that can stand unsupported: The
							prescribed size is a capacity to hold enough oil to anoint the little
							finger of a child. This size is prescribed for pots that are not bigger
							than the small cooking-pots. For small cooking-pots and for those
							between these and the jars from Lydda the prescribed capacity is a
							quarter of a log. For those which have a size between that of Lydda
							jars and Bethlehem jars the capacity must be that of half a log. For
							those between Bethlehem jars and large stone jars the capacity must be
							that of a log. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai says: the prescribed capacity
							for the fragments of large stone jars is two logs, and that for the
							bottoms of broken Galilean flasks and small jars is any whatsoever, but
							the fragments of their sides are not susceptible to impurity

							its thickness is divided and that side which serves the unclean one is
							unclean while that which serves the clean one remains clean. If its rim

							A jar that had a hole and was mended with pitch and then was broken
							again: If the fragment that was mended with the pitch can hold a
							quarter of a log it is unclean, since the designation of a vessel has

							If a jar was about to be cracked but was strengthened with cattle dung,

							it was broken and some of its pieces were stuck together again, or if
							he brought other pieces of clay from elsewhere, and it was also lined
							with cattle dung, even though the potsherds hold together when the dung
							is removed, it is clean, because the designation of vessel ceased to
							apply. If it contained one potsherd that could hold a quarter of a log,

							hold hot water as cold. The same ruling he also gave concerning vessels

							overbalance, is clean. If the handle was removed or the point was
							broken off it is still clean. Rabbi Judah says that it is unclean. If a

							If a jar was cracked and cannot be moved with half a kav of dried figs

							What is meant by a "damaged vessel" (gistera)? One whose handles were
							removed. If sharp ends projected from it: Any part of it which can
							contain olives contracts impurity by contact, while any impurity
							opposite an end conveys impurity to the vessel through its air-space,
							But any part of it which cannot contain olives contracts impurity by
							contact, while an impurity opposite an end does not convey impurity
							through its air-space. If it was leaning on its side like a kind of
							cathedra, Any part of it which can contain olives contracts impurity by
							contact, while any impurity opposite an end conveys impurity to the
							vessel through its air-space, But any part of it which cannot contain
							olives contracts impurity by contact, while an impurity opposite an end
							does not convey impurity to the vessel through its air-space. Bowls
							with Korfian bottoms, and cups with Zidonian bottoms, although they
							cannot stand unsupported, are susceptible to impurity, because they
							were originally fashioned in this manner.

							A baking oven originally must be no less than four handbreadths high

							the sages say: this applies only to a large oven but in the case of a
							small one it originally can be any height and what is left is the
							greater part of it. Its susceptibility to impurity begins as soon as
							its manufacture is completed. What is regarded as the completion of its
							manufacture? When it is heated to a degree that suffices for the baking
							of spongy cakes. Rabbi Judah says: when a new oven has been heated to a
							degree that sufficed for the baking of spongy cakes in an old one.

							A double stove: its original height must be no less than three
							fingerbreadths and what is left of it three fingerbreadths. Its
							susceptibility to impurity begins as soon as its manufacture is
							completed. What is regarded as the completion of its manufacture? When
							it is heated to a degree that suffices for the cooking of the lightest
							of eggs when scrambled and put in a saucepan. A single stove: if it was
							made for baking its prescribed size is the same as that for a
							baking-oven, and if it was made for cooking its prescribed size is the
							same as that for a double stove. A stone that projects one handbreadth
							from a baking-oven or three fingerbreadths from a double stove is
							considered a connection. One that projects from a single stove, if it
							was made for baking, the prescribed size is the same as that for a
							baking-oven, and if it was made for cooking the prescribed size is the
							same as that for a double stove. Rabbi Judah said: they spoke of a
							‘handbreadth’ only where the projection was between the oven and a
							wall. If two ovens were adjacent to one another, they allot one
							handbreadth to this one and one to the other and the remainder is
							clean.

							The crown of a double stove is clean. The fender around an oven: if it
							is four handbreadths high it contracts impurity by contact and through
							its air-space, but if it was lower it is clean. If it was joined to it,
							even if only by three stones, it is unclean. The place on the stove for
							the oil cruse, the spice-pot, and the lamp contract impurity by contact
							but not through their air-space, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Ishmael
							rules that they are clean.

							An oven that was heated from its outside, or one that was heated

							If an oven was half filled with earth, the part from the earth
							downwards contracts impurity by contact only while the part from the
							earth upwards contracts impurity also from its air- space. If he put
							the oven over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar and he
							put a stone at its side: Rabbi Judah says: if when heated below it
							becomes also heated above it is susceptible to impurity. But the sages
							say: since it was heated, no matter how, it is susceptible to impurity.

							If an oven contracted impurity how is it to be cleansed? He must divide
							into three parts and scrape off the plastering so that the oven touches
							the ground. Rabbi Meir says: he does not need to scrape off the
							plastering nor is it necessary for the oven to touch the ground. Rather
							he reduces it within to a height of less than four handbreadths. Rabbi
							Shimon says: he must move it from its position. If it was divided into
							two parts, one large and the other small, the larger remains unclean
							and the smaller becomes clean. If it was divided into three parts one
							of which was as big as the other two together, the big one remains
							unclean and the two small ones become clean.

							If an oven was cut up by its width into rings that are each less than
							four handbreadths in height, it is clean. If he subsequently plastered
							it over with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated
							to a degree that suffices for the baking of spongy cakes. If he
							distanced the plastering, and sand or gravel was put between it and the
							oven sides of such an oven it has been said, "A menstruant as well as a
							clean woman may bake in it and it remains clean."

							An oven which came cut up in sections from the craftsman's house and he
							made for it hoops and put them on it, it is clean. If it contracts

							susceptible to impurity and there is no need to heat it since it was
							once heated.

							can stand of itself it is susceptible to impurity; Otherwise it is not

							If he put three props into the ground and joined them to the ground

							the pot to rest, the structure is not susceptible to impurity. One who
							made a stove of two stones, joining them to the ground with clay: It is
							susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Judah says that it is not susceptible to
							impurity, unless a third stone is added or the structure is placed near
							a wall. If one stone was joined with clay and the other was not joined

							it and on a wall, it is not susceptible to impurity. And such was the
							stove of the Nazirites in Jerusalem which was set up against a rock. As

							If one made two stoves of three stones and one of the outer ones was

							transferred to the unclean one. If the unclean one was removed, the
							middle one is regarded as completely transferred to the clean one.
							Should the two outer ones become defiled, if the middle stone was
							large, each outer stone is allowed such a part of it as suffices for
							the support of a pot and the remainder is clean. But if it was small
							all of it is unclean. Should the middle stone be removed, if a big
							kettle can be set on the two outer stones they are unclean. If the
							middle stone is returned they all become clean again. If it was
							plastered with clay it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is

							The fire-basket of a householder which was lessened by less than three
							handbreadths is susceptible to impurity because when it is heated from
							below a pot above would still boil. If it was lessened to a lower depth
							it is not susceptible to impurity. If subsequently a stone or gravel
							was put into it, it is still not susceptible to impurity. If it was
							plastered over with clay, it may contract impurity from that point and
							onwards. This was Rabbi Judah's reply in connection with the oven that
							was placed over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar.

							A double stove which was split into two parts along its length is
							clean. Through its breadth is unclean. A single stove which was split
							into two parts, by its length or by its width, it is not susceptible to
							impurity. As to the extension around a stove, whenever it is three
							fingerbreadths high it contracts impurity by contact and also through
							its air-space, but if it is less it contracts impurity through contact
							and not through its air- space. How is the air-space determined? Rabbi
							Ishmael says: He puts a spit from above to below and opposite it
							contracts impurity through the air-space. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says:
							if the stove contracted impurity the extension is also unclean, but if
							the fender contracts impurity the stove does not become unclean.

							If it the extension was detached from the stove, whenever it was three

							by contact and through their air-space. If they were lower, all the

							If one of them i.e. the props was removed, the remaining ones contract

							Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean. If originally he made two props,
							one opposite the other, they contract impurity by contact and through
							air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are
							clean. If they were more than three fingerbreadths high, the parts that
							are three fingerbreadths high and below contract impurity by contact
							and through air-space but the parts that are more than three
							fingerbreadths high contract impurity by contact and not through
							air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are
							clean. If they were withdrawn from the rim of the stove, the parts
							which are within three fingerbreadths contract impurity by contact and
							through air-space, and those parts that are removed more than three
							fingerbreadths contract impurity by contact but not through air-space,
							the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean.

							An oven which they partitioned with boards or hangings, and in it was
							found a sheretz in one compartment, the entire oven is unclean. A hive
							which was broken and its gap was stopped up with straw and was
							suspended within the air-space of an oven while a sheretz was within
							it, the oven becomes unclean. If a sheretz was within the oven, any
							food within the hive becomes unclean. But Rabbi Eliezer says that it is
							clean. Rabbi Eliezer said: if it affords protection in the case of a
							corpse which is more consequential, should it not afford protection in
							the case of an earthenware vessel which is less consequential? They
							said to him: if it affords protection in the case of corpse impurity,
							this is because tents are divided, should it also afford protection in

							sheretz was in the oven, any food in the hive remain clean. If a hole
							was made in it: A vessel that is used for food must have a hole large
							enough for olives to fall through, If it is used for liquids the hole
							must be large enough for liquids to pass into it, And if it is used for
							either it is subjected to the greater restriction: the hole need only

							Netting placed over the mouth of an oven and slightly sinking into it,

							susceptible to impurity. An adze, scalpel, plane, or drill that was

							Wood that serves a metal vessel is susceptible to impurity, but metal
							that serves a wooden vessel is clean. How so? If a lock is of wood and

							susceptible to impurity, but if the lock is of metal and its clutches
							are of wood, it is clean. If a ring was of metal and its seal of coral,

							boiler, such as can hold selas. A cauldron, such as can hold jugs.
							Jugs, such as can hold perutahs. Wine-measures, such as can measure

							A staff to the end of which he attached a nail like an axe is

							clean. If he attached a tube to its end, and so also in the case of a
							door, it is clean. If it was once an independent vessel and then it was
							fixed to the staff, it remains susceptible to impurity. When does it
							become pure? Bet Shammai says: when it is damaged; And Bet Hillel says:

							Vessels of wood, leather, bone or glass: those that are flat are clean
							and those that form a receptacle are susceptible to impurity. If they
							are broken they become clean again. If one remade them into vessels
							they are susceptible to impurity henceforth. A chest, a box, a
							cupboard, a straw basket, a reed basket, or the tank of an Alexandrian
							ship, that have flat bottoms and can hold a minimum of forty se'ah in
							liquid measure which represent two kor in dry measure, are clean. All
							other vessels whether they can contain the minimum or cannot contain
							it, are susceptible to impurity, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah
							says: the tub of a wagon, the food chests of kings, the tanners trough,
							the tank of a small ship, and an ark, even though they are able to
							contain the minimum, are susceptible to impurity, since they are
							intended to be moved about with their contents. As to all other
							vessels, those that can contain the minimum are clean and those that
							cannot contain it are susceptible to impurity. There is no difference
							between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah except a baking trough which belongs

							and of a detective's staff, since they aid when the instrument is in

							and a Babylonian drinking vessel are subject to the same law. When do
							wooden vessels begin to be susceptible to impurity? A bed and a cot,
							after they are sanded with fishskin. If the owner determined not to
							sand them over they are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Meir says: a bed

							All wooden vessels that belong to householder become clean if the holes

							The pomegranates of which they have spoken--three attached to one
							another. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: in a sifter or a sieve the
							size of the hole must be such that a pomegranate will drop out when one
							picks it up and walks about with it. In a basket it must be such as
							would allow a pomegranate to fall through while one hangs it behind
							him. And all other vessels which cannot hold pomegranates as, for
							instance, the quarter kav measure and the half quarter kav measure, and
							small baskets, the size of their holes must be such as would extend
							over the greater part of them, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon
							says: the size of their hole must be such that olives could fall
							through. If their sides were broken the size of their hole must be such
							as olives would drop through. If they are worn away the size must be
							such as would allow the objects which are usually kept in them to drop
							through.

							The pomegranate of which they spoke refers to one that is neither small

							to use them as a measure for holes in vessels. Rabbi Akiva said: they
							were mentioned for both reasons: that they are to be used as a measure
							for holes in vessels and that whatever their quantity they cause other
							pomegranates to be forbidden. Rabbi Yose said: the pomegranates of
							Baddan and the leeks of Geba were mentioned only to indicate that they
							must be tithed everywhere with certain tithe.

							The cubit of which they spoke is one of medium size. There were two

							corner exceeded that of Moses by half a fingerbreadth, while the one in
							the south-eastern corner exceeded the other by half a fingerbreadth, so
							that the latter exceeded that of Moses by a fingerbreadth. But why were
							there a larger and a smaller cubit? Only for this reason: so that
							craftsmen might take their orders according to the smaller cubit and
							return their finished work according to the larger cubit, so that they
							might not be guilty of any possible trespassing of Temple property.

							who takes both hands full of incense, One who drinks a cheek full on
							Yom Kippur, And the two meals for an eruv, The quantity being the food
							one eats on weekdays and not on Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi
							Judah says: as on Shabbat and not as on weekdays. And both intended to
							give the more lenient ruling. Rabbi Shimon says: two thirds of a loaf,
							when three loaves are made of a kav. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: not
							less than a loaf that is purchased for a pundium when the price of
							wheat is four se'ah for a sela’.

							quantity of the bulk of a large date, refers to the size of the date
							and its pit; In the case of skins of wine and oil the holes must be as
							big as their large stopper; In the case of a light hole that was not
							made by man's hands the prescribed size of which is that of a large
							fist, the reference is to the fist of Ben Batiah Rabbi Yose said: and
							it is as big as a large human head. And in the case of one made by
							human hands the prescribed size is that of the large drill in the
							Temple chamber which is the size of the Italian pondium or the Neronian
							sela or like the hole in a yoke.

							on the fifth day, except for the wing of the vulture or an ostrich-egg

							If a bed leg that had contracted midras uncleanness was joined to a

							uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts seven-day
							uncleanness. If it was subsequently taken off it remains subject to
							seven-day uncleanness while the bed is only subject to
							evening-uncleanness. If a leg that was subject to evening uncleanness
							was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts evening uncleanness. If it
							was subsequently taken off it is still subject to evening uncleanness
							while the bed becomes clean. The same law applies also to the prong of

							from contact with corpse uncleanness. If he went back to the first
							compartment and unloosed and mended it, it remains unclean from
							contact. So also in the case of the second compartment. If he then
							unloosed the third compartment and mended it becomes clean, since the
							fourth is unclean from contact, and what is unclean from contact cannot

							If a zav was carried on a bed and on its mattress, the latter causes an

							uncleanness of two grades and an unfitness of one grade, but that which
							is over the ten handbreadths causes only an uncleanness of one grade

							If around a bed that had contracted midras uncleanness one wrapped a

							contracted seven-day uncleanness one wrapped a mattress, the whole
							becomes subject to seven-day uncleanness. If it was removed, the bed
							remains subject to seven-day uncleanness but the mattress is unclean
							until the evening. If the bed was subject to evening uncleanness and
							around it he wrapped a mattress, the whole becomes subject to evening
							uncleanness; If it was removed, the bed remains subject to evening

							A bagpipe is not susceptible to midras uncleanness. A trough for mixing

							susceptible to midras uncleanness. If he left it out in the rain and it
							swelled it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness alone. If he left it
							out during the east wind and it split, it is susceptible to midras
							uncleanness. In this respect the law is stricter in the case of
							remnants of wooden vessels than in that of such vessels in their
							original condition. It is also stricter in regard to the remnants of
							wicker vessels than to such vessels as are in their original condition,
							for when they are in their original condition they are insusceptible to

							If a stick was used as a handle for a hatchet, it is regarded as

							only that part which is needed for use is susceptible to uncleanness. A
							seat that was fixed to the pole is susceptible to uncleanness, but the
							latter is not regarded as connected to it. If the pole itself was
							turned into a seat, only the place of the seat is susceptible to
							uncleanness. A seat that was fixed to the beam of an olive-press is
							susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not connected to it. If the end
							of a beam was turned into a seat it remains clean, because people would
							tell him, "Get up and let us do our work."

							An ox-goad has different laws for its outer and inner parts, The outer
							part is the seven handbreadths from the broad blade and four
							handbreadths from the point, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says:
							it is not to subject to such distinction, the four and the seven
							handbreadths were mentioned only in regard to its remnants.

							Measures of wine or oil, a fork-ladle, a mustard-strainer and a
							wine-filter have an outer and inner side, the words of Rabbi Meir.
							Rabbi Judah says: they do not have. Rabbi Shimon says: they do have,
							for if their outer parts contracted uncleanness that which is inside
							remains clean, and immersion is required.

							If in a measure consisting of a quarter of a log and half a quarter of
							a log the quarter measure contracted uncleanness, the half-quarter
							measure does not become unclean, and if the half-quarter contracted
							uncleanness the quarter does not become unclean. They argued before
							Rabbi Akiva: since the half quarter measure is the outer part of the
							quarter measure, should not the outer side of the vessel whose inner
							side contracted uncleanness become unclean? He answered them: Are you
							sure that it belongs to the category of vessels that have inner and
							outer parts? Perhaps the quarter is to be regarded as the outer side of
							the half quarter and, surely, the inner side of a vessel does not
							become unclean if the outer side contracted uncleanness.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 25: Mishnah 5

							If the inside of the quarter contracted uncleanness, the quarter and
							its outer side are unclean, but the half quarter and its outer side
							remain clean. If the inside of the half quarter contracted uncleanness,
							the half quarter and its outer side are unclean, but the quarter and
							its outer side remain clean. If the outer side of the quarter
							contracted uncleanness,the outer side of the half quarter remains
							clean, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the outer side
							cannot be divided. When he immerses the vessel, he must immerse the
							whole thing.

							The bases, rims, hangers or handles of vessels that have a receptacle
							upon which an unclean liquid fell, one dries them and they remain
							clean. But if unclean liquid fell on any part of any other vessel which
							cannot hold pomegranates (or in which no distinction is made between
							its outer and inner sides), the whole becomes unclean. If the outer
							side of a vessel contracted uncleanness from a liquid, only its outer
							side is unclean but its inner side, rim, hanger and handles remain
							clean. If its inner side contracted uncleanness the whole is unclean.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 25: Mishnah 7

							All vessels have outer and inner sides and have a part by which they
							are held. Rabbi Tarfon says: this applies only to a large wooden
							kneading trough. Rabbi Akiva says: it applies to cups. Rabbi Meir says:
							it applies to unclean and clean hands. Rabbi Yose says: they said this
							only concerning clean hands.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 1 - Kelim: Perek 25: Mishnah 8

						-
							How so? If one's hands were clean and the outer side of a cup was
							unclean, one may hold it by its holding-place and need not be concerned
							lest his hands have contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the
							cup. If one was drinking from a cup whose outer side was unclean he
							need not be concerned lest the liquid in his mouth contracted
							uncleanness from the outer side of the cup and that it then conveyed
							uncleanness to the cup. If a kettle was boiling one need not be
							concerned lest liquid should come out from it and touch its outer side
							and return again within it.

							An Imki sandal and a laced-up bag, Rabbi Judah says: also an Egyptian
							basket; Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: also to a Lattakian sandal can
							be made susceptible to uncleanness and again be made insusceptible
							without the aid of a craftsman. Rabbi Yose said: But can't all vessels
							be made susceptible to uncleanness and again insusceptible without the
							aid of a craftsman? Rather, these, even when they are unlaced are
							susceptible to uncleanness since a layman is able to restore them. They
							spoke only of an Egyptian basket which even a craftsman cannot easily

							A sandal, one of whose holes was broken but was then fixed, retains its

							free from midras uncleanness but is unclean from contact with midras.
							If the second hole was broken before the first could be mended, it is
							clean. If its heel was torn off, or if its toe-piece was removed, or if
							it was torn in two, it becomes clean. A heel-less slipper that was torn
							anywhere becomes clean. A shoe that was damaged becomes clean if it
							cannot contain the greater part of the foot. A shoe that is still on
							the last: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is insusceptible to uncleanness, But
							the sages say that it is susceptible. All water skins whose holes have
							been tied up are insusceptible to uncleanness, except for Arabian ones.
							Rabbi Meir says: if they are tied up for a while, they are clean; but
							if they are tied with a permanent knot they are unclean. Rabbi Yose

							by a thief do not become susceptible by intention, since in the latter

							Cloth is susceptible to five categories of uncleanness; Sack-cloth is
							susceptible to four; Leather to three; Wood to two; And an earthenware
							vessel to one. An earthenware vessel is susceptible to uncleanness only
							as a receptacle; any earthen vessel that has no inner part is not
							susceptible to uncleanness from its outer part. Wood is subject to an
							additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to
							uncleanness as a seat. Similarly a tablet which has no rim is
							susceptible to uncleanness if it is a wooden object and insusceptible
							if it is an earthenware one. Leather is susceptible to an additional
							form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to the uncleanness
							of a tent. Sack-cloth has an additional form of uncleanness in that it
							is susceptible to uncleanness as woven work. Cloth has an additional
							form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness when it is
							only three by three fingerbreadths.

							Cloth is susceptible to midras uncleanness when it is three

							is three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths. Sack-cloth when it is
							four handbreadths by four handbreadths. Leather, five handbreadths by
							five handbreadths. And matting, six handbreadths by six handbreadths.
							All of these are equally susceptible to both midras and corpse
							uncleanness. Rabbi Meir says: what remains of sack-cloth is susceptible
							to uncleanness if it is four handbreadths, but when in its first
							condition it becomes susceptible only after its manufacture is
							completed.

							If one made up a piece of material from two handbreadths of cloth and

							the piece of material was made up of five handbreadths of matting and
							one of leather or four of leather and one of sack-cloth, or three of
							sack-cloth and one of cloth it is susceptible to uncleanness. This is

							added was subject to lesser restrictions it is not susceptible.

							not susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say one who cuts off a

							Worn-out pieces of a sifter or a sieve that were adapted for use as a

							than a handbreadth high, is susceptible to uncleanness. A child's
							shirt: Rabbi Eliezer rules it is susceptible to uncleanness at any
							size. But the sages rule: it is susceptible only if it is of the
							prescribed size, and it is measured when doubled over.

							If a piece of cloth was woven to the size of three by three
							handbreadths, and then it contracted midras uncleanness, and then he
							completed the rest of the piece, and then one removed a single thread
							from the original part, it is free from midras uncleanness but is still
							unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. If he removed a thread
							from the original part and then he finished the whole cloth, it is

							Similarly, if a piece of cloth was woven to the size of three
							fingerbreadths square, and it contracted corpse uncleanness, and
							afterwards he finished the entire piece, and then he removed a single
							thread from its original part, it is free from corpse uncleanness but
							is still unclean from contact with corpse uncleanness. If a thread was
							removed from the original part and then all the cloth was finished it
							remains clean, for the sages have ruled: if a piece of three
							fingerbreadths square is lessened it becomes clean. But if one of three
							handbreadths square is lessened, even though it is released from
							midras, it is still susceptible to all other forms of uncleanness.

							If a piece of cloth three handbreadths square was found in a rubbish

							quarter of a kav. Rabbi Judah says: this refers to fine salt, But the
							sages stated: it refers to coarse salt. Both intended to be lenient.
							Rabbi Shimon says: the law concerning a piece of cloth three
							handbreadths square found in a rubbish heap is the same as that for a

							If a patch was sewn on to a basket, it conveys one grade of uncleanness

							If one had collected hallah portions with the intention of keeping them
							separate, but in the meantime they had become stuck together: Bet
							Shammai say: they are connected in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet
							Hillel say: they are not connected. Pieces of dough of terumah that had
							become stuck together, Or loaves that had become joined, or one who
							bakes a batter-cake on top of another batter-cake before it could form
							a crust in the oven, or the froth on the water that was bubbling, or
							the first scum that rises when boiling groats of beans, or the scum of
							new wine (r. Judah says: also that of rice): Bet Shammai say: they are
							connected in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet Hillel say: they are not
							connected. They agree that they serve as connectives if they come into
							contact with other kinds of uncleanness, whether they be of minor or
							major grades.

							If one had collected pieces of hallah without the intention of
							separating them afterwards, or a batter-cake that had been baked on
							another after a crust had formed in the oven, or froth had appeared in
							the water prior to its bubbling up, or the second scum that appeared in
							the boiling of groats of beans, or the scum of old wine, or that of oil
							of all kinds, or of lentils, Rabbi Judah says: also that of beans; All
							these are defiled when touched by a tevul yom. And there is no need to
							say, this is the case if touched by other sources of uncleanness.

							The nail shaped knob on the back of the loaf, or the small globule of
							salt, or the burnt crust less than a finger's breadth: Rabbi Yose says:
							whatever is eaten with the loaf becomes unclean when touched by the
							tevul yom. And one doesn't need to say, this is so when touched by
							other unclean things.

							A pebble in a loaf or a large globule of salt, or a lupine, or a burnt

							impurity; And it isn't even necessary to say is this so when touched by
							a tevul yom.

						-
							Liquids that come out of a tevul yom are like those which he has
							touched: neither of them causes defilement. With regard to all others
							that are unclean, be they of minor or major degree, the liquids that
							come out of them are like those they touch; both have first degree
							impurity. Except for liquid that is a "father of impurity."

						-
							A pot which was full of liquid and a tevul yom touched it: If it is
							terumah, the liquid is disqualified, but the pot is clean. But if the
							liquid is non-sacred hullin then all remains clean. If his hands were
							defiled and he touched the liquids in the pot, all becomes unclean.
							This is a case defiled hands are treated more stringently than a tevul
							yom. But a greater stringency is applied to a tevul yom than to defiled
							hands, since a doubtful tevul yom disqualifies terumah, but doubts with
							regard to defiled hands are clean.

						-
							If the porridge was of terumah and the garlic or oil it contained was
							of hullin, and a tevul yom touched part of them, he has disqualified
							the whole thing; But if the porridge was of hullin and the garlic or
							oil it contained was of terumah, and a tevul yom touched part of them,
							he disqualifies only the part he has touched. If the greater part was
							garlic then they go after the majority. Rabbi Judah said: When is this
							so? When it formed one cohesive mass in the pot, but if it was
							scattered small in the mortar, then it is clean, since he wishes that
							it should be scattered. Similarly with all other mashed foods which
							were mashed with liquids. But those which are usually mashed with
							liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one
							cohesive mass in the pot, are regarded as a cake of preserved figs.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 2 - Tevul Yom: Perek 2: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							If the porridge and batter-cake were of hullin and oil of terumah was
							floating above them, and a tevul yom touched the oil, he disqualifies
							only the oil. If he stirred it altogether, all the places where the oil
							goes are disqualified.

							Sanctified meat over which the porridge crusted, and a tevul yom
							touched the crust, the slices of meat are permitted. But if he touched
							one of the slices, that slice and all the crust that comes up with it
							form a connective the one with the other. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says:
							the two of them serve as connectives to each other. Similarly, with
							cooked beans that have formed a layer over pieces of bread. Beans or
							other foods cooked in a pot: when they are still separate, do not serve
							as connectives; but when they become a solid pulp, they do act as
							connectives. If they formed several solid masses, they are to be
							counted. If oil floats on wine and a tevul yom touched the oil, only
							the oil is disqualified. But Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: each serves
							as a connective with the other.

							A jug which sunk into a cistern containing wine, and a tevul yom
							touched it: If he touched it from the rim and inwards, it serves as a
							connective; If from the rim and outwards, it does not serve as a
							connective. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: even though the level of wine
							in the cistern is the height of a man above the sunken jar, and he
							touched the wine directly above the mouth of the jar, it serves as a
							connective.

						-
							If a jug had a hole either at its neck, bottom or sides, and a tevul
							yom touched it at the hole, it becomes unclean. Rabbi Judah says: if
							the hole is at its neck or bottom it becomes unclean; but if on its
							sides, on this side or on that, it remains clean. If one poured liquid
							from one vessel into another, and a tevul yom touched the stream, and
							there was something within the vessel, then whatsoever he touches is
							neutralized in a hundred and one.

							Handles to food, which count as connectives when touched by a "father
							of uncleanness," also count as connectives when touched by a tevul yom.
							If a food was divided into two yet a small part was still attached:
							Rabbi Meir says: if one takes hold of the larger part and the smaller
							part is pulled away with it, behold it is like it. Rabbi Judah says: if
							one takes hold of the smaller part and the greater is also pulled away
							with it, then behold it is like it. Rabbi Nehemiah says: this refers to
							the case of the clean portion. But the sages say: it refers to the
							unclean portion. In the case of all other foods, those usually held by
							the leaf should be taken by the leaf, and those usually held by the
							stalk should be taken by the stalk.

							If a beaten egg was on top of vegetables of terumah, and a tevul yom
							touches the egg, then he disqualifies only that stalk of the vegetables
							that is opposite the part of the egg he touched. Rabbi Yose says: the
							entire upper layer. But if it was arranged like a cap it does not serve
							as a connective.

						-
							The streak of an egg that had become congealed on the side of a pan and
							a tevul yom touched it: If within the rim of the pan it serves as a
							connective; But if outside the rim, it does not serve as a connective.
							Rabbi Yose says that the streak and the part that can be peeled away
							with it serves as a connective. The same applies to beans that had
							congealed on the rim of the pot.

							Dough that had been mixed with dough of terumah or that had been
							leavened with yeast of terumah, is not disqualified by tevul yom. Rabbi
							Yose and Rabbi Shimon declare it unfit. Dough that had become
							susceptible to uncleanness by a liquid, and it was kneaded with produce
							juice, and later touched by a tevul yom: Rabbi Elazar ben Judah of
							Barthotha says in the name of Rabbi Joshua: he disqualifies all of it.
							Rabbi Akiva says in his name: he disqualifies only the part that he
							touched.

							Vegetables of hullin were cooked with oil of terumah and a tevul yom

							If food that was tithe had been rendered susceptible to impurity by a
							liquid, and a tevul yom or one with unwashed hands touched it, terumah
							of tithe may still be removed from it in purity, since it only has
							third degree uncleanness, and third degree uncleanness counts as clean
							in hullin.

							A woman who is a tevulat yom may knead dough, cut off the hallah, and
							set it apart, and she should arrange it on an Egyptian basket, or on a
							tray, and then bring it near and call it by its name. For it the dough
							has third degree uncleanness and third degree uncleanness is clean in
							hullin.

							A flagon was a tevul yom and they filled it from a cask containing
							tithes from which terumah had not yet been taken: If one said, let this
							be terumah of tithe after nightfall, it becomes terumah of tithe. But
							if he said: let this be the food for the eruv, he has said nothing. If
							the cask was broken, the contents of the flagon still remain tithe from
							which terumah had not yet been taken. If the flagon was broken, then
							what is in the cask still remains tithe from which terumah had not yet
							been taken.

							Originally they said: one may redeem second tithe for the produce of an
							am ha-arez. Later they reconsidered and said: also for money of
							his.Originally they said that if a man was being led out to execution
							and said, “Write a get for my wife”, they may write a get and give it
							to her. Later they reconsidered and said, even if he were leaving on a
							sea voyage or on a caravan journey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even if
							he were dangerously ill.

							If Ashkelon grappling-irons were broken but their hooks remained, they
							remain susceptible to impurity. If a pitch-fork, winnowing-fan, or
							rake, and the same applies to a hair-comb, lost one of its teeth and it
							was replaced by one of metal, it is susceptible to impurity. And
							concerning all these Rabbi Joshua said: the scribes have here
							introduced a new principle of law, and I have no explanation to offer.

							If one was taking terumah from a cistern and said: "Let this be terumah
							provided it comes up safely," it is implied that he meant safely from
							being broken or spilled, but not from becoming impure; But Rabbi Shimon
							says: also from impurity. If it were broken, it does not render the
							contents of the cistern subject to the restrictions of terumah. How far
							away can it be broken and still not make the contents of the cistern
							subject to terumah restrictions? Only so far that if it rolls back, it
							can reach the cistern. Rabbi Yose says: even if one had the intention
							of making such a stipulation, but did not do so, and it broke, it does
							not make the contents of the cistern subject to terumah restrictions,
							for this is a stipulation laid down by the court.

							Two are defiled through a corpse, one being defiled with seven days'

							What is the case of four? Vessels touching a corpse, a person touching
							these vessels, and other vessels touching this person, are defiled with
							seven days' defilement. The fourth, whether a person or vessels, is
							defiled with a defilement lasting until the evening. Rabbi Akiva said:
							I have a fifth, if a peg was fixed in a tent, the tent, the peg, a
							person touching the peg and vessels touching the person are defiled
							with seven days' defilement. The fifth, whether a person or vessels, is
							defiled with a defilement lasting until the evening. They said to him:
							the tent does not count.

							Both persons and vessels can be defiled through a corpse. A greater
							stringency applies to persons than to vessels and to vessels than to
							persons. For with vessels there can be three series of defilements,
							whereas with persons there can be only two. A greater stringency
							applies to persons, for whenever they are in the middle of a series
							there can be four in the series, whereas when they are not in the
							middle of a series there can be only three.

							Persons and garments can be defiled by a zav. A greater stringency
							applies to persons than to garments and a greater stringency applies to
							garments than to persons. For a person who touches a zav can defile
							garments, whereas garments that touch a zav cannot defile other
							garments. A greater stringency applies to garments, for garments which
							form the support of a zav can defile persons, whereas a person who
							forms the support of a zav cannot defile other persons.

							A person does not defile as a corpse until he dies. Even he is cut up
							or even if he is about to die, he still makes levirate marriage
							obligatory and exempts from levirate marriage, he feeds his mother
							terumah and disqualifies his mother from eating terumah. Similarly in
							the case of cattle or wild animals, they do not defile until they die.
							If their heads have been cut off, even though they are moving
							convulsively, they are unclean, like a lizard's tail, which moves
							convulsively.

							The following likewise defile:A quarter of a log of blood, A quarter of

							corpses. With regard to the blood of a child that has completely flowed
							forth: Rabbi Akiva says: it defiles in even the smallest quantity, But
							the sages say: there must be a quarter of a log. With regard to an
							olive-sized portion of corpse worms whether alive or dead: Rabbi
							Eliezer declares it unclean, like the flesh, But the sages declare it
							clean. With regard to the ashes of burnt persons: Rabbi Eliezer says:
							the minimum quantity for defilement is a quarter of a kav. But the
							sages declare them to be clean. A ladleful and a little more of
							grave-dust is unclean. Rabbi Shimon declares it to be clean. A ladleful
							of corpse-mold mixed with water is not regarded as joined into one mass
							for the purposes of defilement.

							The following defile by contact and carriage but not by overshadowing:
							A bone of barleycorn size, Earth from a foreign country, A bet peras, A
							limb of a corpse, or a limb severed from a living person which has no
							longer its appropriate flesh, A spine or a skull which is deficient.
							How much is considered a deficiency in the spine? Bet Shammai say: two
							vertebrae, But Bet Hillel say: even one vertebra. And in the skull? Bet
							Shammai say: the size of a hole made by a drill, But Bet Hillel say: as
							much as would be taken from a living person and he would die. Of what
							drill did they speak? Of the small one used by physicians, the words of
							Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: of the large one in the Temple-chamber.

							The covering stone and the buttressing stone of a grave defile by

							carriage. What is the buttressing stone? That upon which the covering
							stone is supported. But the stone that serves as buttress to the
							buttressing stone is clean.

							All objects that defile by overshadowing which were divided and then
							brought into a house: Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declares clean. But the
							sages declare it unclean. What is the case? One who touches two pieces
							of nevelah, each the size of half an olive, or carries them, Or, in the
							case of a corpse, if he touches a piece the size of half an olive and
							overshadows another piece the size of half an olive, Or if he touches a
							piece the size of half an olive and another piece the size of half an
							olive overshadows him, Or if he overshadows two pieces, each the size
							of half an olive, Or if he overshadows a piece the size of half an
							olive and another piece the size of half an olive overshadows him:
							Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declares him clean, And the sages declare him
							unclean. But if he touches a piece the size of half an olive and
							another object overshadows him and another piece the size of half an
							olive, Or if he overshadows a piece the size of half an olive and
							another object overshadows him and another piece the size of half an
							olive, he is clean. Rabbi Meir says: Even here Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas
							declares him clean and the sages declare him unclean. Every case is
							unclean except a case of contact combined with carriage or of carriage
							combined with overshadowing. This is the general principle: every
							object whose defilement proceeds from one cause is unclean, from two
							causes is clean.

							If a ladleful of corpse-mold was scattered about in a house, the house
							is unclean But Rabbi Shimon declares it clean. If a quarter of a log of
							blood was absorbed in the ground of a house, the house is clean. If it
							was absorbed by a garment: if the garment is washed and a quarter of a
							log of blood emerges from it, it is unclean, if not, it is clean, since
							anything absorbed that cannot emerge is clean.

							Blood which was poured out in the air: If the place where it fell was
							an incline and a person or vessel overshadowed part of it, he remains
							clean. If it was a cavity, or if the blood congealed, he becomes
							unclean. If it was poured out on a threshold: If it inclined either
							inwards or outwards and the house overshadowed it that which is in the
							house is clean. If there was a cavity, or if it congealed, that which
							is in the house becomes unclean. Every part of a corpse is unclean
							except the teeth, hair and nails; But when they are joined to the
							corpse, they are all unclean.
						-
					-
						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 3 - Oholot: Perek 3: Mishnah 4
					-
						-
							How so? If the corpse was outside and its hair inside, the house is
							unclean. With regard to a bone which had upon it an olive-sized portion
							of flesh, if one brought part of it within so that the house was
							overshadowing it, the house is unclean. With regard to two bones which
							had upon them two pieces of flesh, each the size of half an olive, if
							one brought part of them within so that the house was overshadowing
							them, the house is unclean. But if the pieces of flesh were set into
							the bone by a person, the house is clean since connections created by
							human agency are not regarded as connections.

							What is ‘mixed blood? The blood of a corpse of which an eighth of a log
							came out during his lifetime and an eighth after death, the words of
							Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Ishmael says: a quarter of a log during his lifetime
							and a quarter after death. If a quarter of a log is taken from both of
							these: Rabbi Elazar bar Judah says: both of these are as water. What
							then is ‘mixed blood’? It is that of a crucified person whose blood is
							streaming forth and under whom is found a quarter of a log of blood it
							is unclean. However a corpse whose blood drips forth and under whom is
							found a quarter of a log of blood, the blood is clean. Rabbi Judah
							says: not so, but that which streams forth is clean and that which
							drips forth is unclean.

							For an olive-sized portion of a corpse, an opening in the room in which
							it is found of one handbreadth square, and for a whole corpse, an
							opening of four handbreadths square, is enough to prevent the
							uncleanness from spreading to the other openings; But for allowing the
							uncleanness to go out, an opening of one handbreadth square is enough.
							A portion greater than the size of an olive is as a whole corpse. Rabbi
							Yose says: only the spine and the skull are as a whole corpse.

							says: “It protects only food and liquids and other vessels of
							earthenware.” Bet Hillel changed their opinion and taught as Bet
							Shammai.Beth Hillel said to them: “Why? ” Beth Shammai said to them:
							“Because it is itself impure with respect to an ignoramus, and no
							impure vessel can screen against impurity.” Beth Hillel said to them:
							“And did you not pronounce pure the food and liquids inside it? ” Beth
							Shammai said to them: “When we pronounced pure the food and liquids
							inside it, we pronounced them pure for him the ignoramus only, but when
							you pronounced the vessel pure you pronounced it pure for yourself and
							for him.” Then Beth Hillel changed their mind and taught according to
							the opinion of Beth Shammai.

							become unclean. If it was a smooth board or netting without rims, the

							an ohel unless they themselves have walls. How much must the wall be? A
							handbreadth. If there was half a handbreadth on one side and half a

							is uncleanness beneath it, vessels upon it become unclean. If the chest

							A wall serving a house is treated as if it was separate halves. How so?
							A wall serving an open space, that has uncleanness within it: If it is

							remains clean. If it is in the outward half, the house remains clean,
							But what is above the wall becomes unclean. If it is exactly in the

							In the case of a wall between two houses and there is uncleanness

							and there are vessels in the thickness of the wall: Those in the half
							nearer the uncleanness are unclean, Those in the half nearer the clean
							house are clean, And those in the middle are unclean. With regard to
							the plaster-work between the house and the upper story, and there is
							uncleanness in it: If it is in the lower half, the house below is
							unclean and the upper story is clean If it is in the upper half, the
							upper story is unclean and the house is clean: If it is in the middle,
							both are unclean. If there is uncleanness in either the house or the
							upper story and there are vessels inside the plaster-work, Those in the
							half nearer the uncleanness are unclean, And those in the half nearer
							the clean space are clean. If they are in the middle, they are unclean.

							If there is uncleanness in a wall, in a space of one cubic handbreadth,

							becomes unclean but all upper stories above it remain clean. In a
							beach- wall, uncleanness cleaves upwards and downward. With regard to a
							solid tomb monument, a person who touches it from the side remains
							clean, since its uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. But if
							there was a free space of a cubic handbreadth in the place where the
							uncleanness was, a person touching it anywhere becomes unclean, because
							it is like a closed grave. If he supported sukkot on the monument they

							All sloping parts of ‘tents’ are reckoned like ‘tents.' A ‘tent’ whose
							sides sloped downwards and finished off one fingerbreadth from the
							ground: If there is uncleanness in the ‘tent’, vessels beneath the
							slope become unclean. If there is uncleanness beneath the slope,
							vessels in the ‘tent’ become unclean. If there is uncleanness within, a
							person who touches the tent from the inside acquires a seven days’
							defilement, but from the outside, a defilement lasting till evening. If
							there had been uncleanness outside, a person who touches the ‘tent’
							from the outside acquires a seven days’ defilement, but from the
							inside, a defilement lasting till evening. If there was a portion of
							uncleanness the size of half an olive touching it from inside and half
							an olive from the outside, a person who touches the ‘tent’ either from
							within or without acquires a defilement lasting till evening. If a part
							of the ‘tent’ side trailed along the ground, when there is uncleanness
							beneath or above this part, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and
							downwards. In the case of a ‘tent’ erected in an upper story, with a
							portion of its side trailing over the hatch between the house and the

							does not protect unless it put up in the usual manner of erecting

							If a corpse is in a house in which there are many doors, they all

							he protects all the other doors. Bet Shammai says: the intention must
							have been formed before the person died. Bet Hillel say: even after he
							died. If a door was blocked up and it was decided to open it: Bet
							Shammai says: it is effective as soon he opens a a space four

							overshadowed a grave. He was declared unclean on account of vessels
							that were overshadowing a corpse. Rabbi Akiva said: I can fix the
							halakhah so that the words of the sages can exist as they are: All
							movable things convey uncleanness to come upon a person carrying them,
							when they are of the thickness of an ox-goad; Upon themselves when they

							conveys uncleanness to come upon itself whatever its thickness. A pot
							seller passes by a grave with a yoke over his shoulder, one end of
							which overshadows a grave, vessels on the other side remain clean. If
							the yoke is one handbreadth wide, they become unclean. Mounds which are
							near to a city or to a road, whether they are new or old, are unclean.
							As for those that are far away, new ones are clean but old ones are
							unclean. What counts as near? Fifty cubits. And old? Sixty years old,

							cubits between the first and the last, that is, the space of a bier and
							its bearers, then it must be accounted a graveyard. He must search the
							ground for twenty cubits from that point. If he found another corpse at

							Rabbi Eliezer says: one bet peras can form another bet peras. Rabbi
							Joshua says: sometimes it can, but at other times it cannot. How so? If
							he plowed for half a furrow's length and then returned and plowed a
							further half, or similarly if he plowed to the side, he makes a bet
							peras. If he plowed a full furrow's length and then returned and plowed
							from that point beyond, he does not make this a bet peras.

							How does one harvest the grapes of a bet peras? They sprinkle hatat
							water on the harvesters and the vessels once and then a second time.
							Then they harvest the grapes and take them out of the bet peras. Others
							then receive the grapes and take them to the winepress. If the latter
							set of persons came into contact with the former, they become unclean,
							This is according to the words of Bet Hillel. Bet Shammai say: the
							gatherer holds the sickle with sinew-rope, or harvests the grapes with
							a sharp flint, lets the grapes fall into a basket, and then he takes
							them to the winepress. Rabbi Yose said: When do these rules apply? Only
							in the case of a vineyard which subsequently became a bet peras; but a
							person who plants vines in a bet peras must sell the grapes in the

							There are three kinds of bet peras: A field in which a grave was plowed

							Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: grain must be sifted through two sieves,
							but pulse through three sieves. And he must burn the stubble and the
							stalks. Such a field conveys uncleanness by contact and carriage but
							does not convey uncleanness by overshadowing.

							is not examined for one who wants to eat terumah. And as for a
							nazirite: Bet Shammai say: it is examined, But Bet Hillel say: it is

							it. If they removed soil from a depth of three handbreadths from one
							half and upon the other half they placed three hand breadths of soil,
							it becomes clean. Rabbi Shimon says: even they removed one handbreadth
							and a half and placed upon it one handbreadth and a half from another
							place, it becomes clean. One who paves a bet peras with stones that
							cannot easily be moved, it becomes clean. Rabbi Shimon says: even if

							Shabbat; Nor on a Monday, since the end of the second week will fall on
							Shabbat; Nor on a Tuesday, in the case of houses, since the end of the

							How does it lead to a leniency? If the nega had two white hairs and one

							If they were long and then they became short. If one was long and the
							other short and both became short. If a boil adjoined both hairs or one
							of them. If the boil surrounded both hairs or one of them. Or if they
							were separated from each other by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a
							burning, or the quick flesh of a burning, or a white scurf. If it had
							undiscolored flesh and this undiscolored flesh disappeared. If it was
							square and then became round or elongated. If it was encompassed and
							then moved to the side. If it was united and then it was dispersed. Or
							a boil appeared and made its way into it. If it was encompassed, parted
							or lessened by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burning, the quick
							flesh of a burning, or a white scurf; If it had a spreading and then
							the spreading disappeared; Or the first sign itself disappeared or was
							so lessened that both are less than the size of a split bean; Or if a
							boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burning, the quick flesh of a
							burning, or a white scurf, formed a division between the first sign and
							the spreading Behold these lead to a leniency in the law.

							The bright spot in a German appears as dull white, and the dull white

							white, and in an intermediate shade; let, therefore a paint of an
							intermediate shade be brought and applied around the outside of the
							nega, and it will then appear as on skin of intermediate shade. Rabbi
							Judah says: in determining the colors of negaim the law is to be
							lenient and not stringent; let,therefore, the negaim of the German be
							inspected on the color of his own body so that the law is lenient, and
							let that of the Ethiopian be inspected as if it were on the
							intermediate shade so that the law is also lenient. The sages say: both

							who is isolated may not be isolated again nor may one who is certified

							Deposited hair: Akaviah ben Mahalalel holds it is unclean. But the
							sages hold it to be clean. What is "deposited hair"? If one had a
							bright spot with white hair in it, and the bright spot disappeared
							leaving the white hair in position and then it reappeared: Akaviah ben
							Mahalalel holds it to be unclean, But the sages hold it to be clean.
							Rabbi Akiva said: in this case I agree that he is clean; But what is
							"deposited hair"? If one had a bright spot of the size of a split bean
							with two hairs in it, and a part the size of a half a split bean
							disappeared leaving the white hair in the place of the white spot and
							then it reappeared. They said to him: just as they rejected the ruling
							of Akaviah so is there no validity in your ruling.

							Any doubt in negaim in the beginning is regarded as clean before

							established a doubt is regarded as unclean. How is this so? If two men

							the other having one of the size of a sela, and at the end of the week
							each had one the size of a sela, and it is not known on which of them
							the spreading had occurred, Whether this occurred with one man or with

							unclean, but if two men are involved each is clean.

							If a bright spot was the size of a split bean and quick flesh the size

							within it. If it decreased or disappeared: Rabban Gamaliel says: if its
							destruction was on its inner side it is a sign of spreading of the

							was isolated? " They said to me, "We did not hear anything about this

							remains unclean." I began to bring them proofs: whether the man stands
							before the priest or whether he is isolated, he is clean unless the
							priest had pronounced him unclean. When does he attain cleanness after
							he has been certified unclean? Rabbi Eliezer says: after another nega
							arises in him and he has attained cleanness after it. But the sages

							Scalls may become unclean for two weeks and by two signs: by thin

							the expression when people say, "This stick is thin," or "This reed is
							thin"? Does "thin" imply that it is stunted and short and not stunted

							Yellow thin hair causes uncleanness whether it is clustered together or

							Shimon says: it causes uncleanness only when it came after the scall.
							Rabbi Shimon said: Is it not logical: if white hair, against which
							other hair affords no protection, causes uncleanness only when it comes
							after the nega, how much more should yellow thin hair, against which
							other hair does afford protection, cause uncleanness only when it comes
							after the scall? Rabbi Judah says: Whenever it was necessary to say,
							"it turns" Scripture says, "it turns." But the scall, since about it
							Scripture says, "there is no yellow hair in it," it causes uncleanness
							whether it came before or after it.

							Black hair that sprouts up affords protection against yellow hair and

							also when encompassed, but it affords no protection where it is at the
							side unless it is distant from the standing hair by the place of two
							hairs. If one hair was yellow and the other black, or if one was yellow

							prevent one another, the head and the beard, between which nothing
							intervenes, should they not also prevent one another? The head and the

							A garment whose warp was colored and whose woof was white, or whose
							woof was colored and whose warp was white, all depends on what is most
							visible. Garments contract uncleanness if they are an intense green or
							an intense red. If the nega was green and it spread out red, or if it
							was red and it spread out green, it is unclean. If its color changed
							and then it spread, or if it changed and it did not spread, it is
							regarded as if it had not changed. Rabbi Judah says: let it be

							A nega that remained unchanged during the first week must be washed and

							should be washed and isolated. But the sages say: he is not required to
							do so. If the nega became dimmer during the first week it must be
							washed and isolated. If it became dimmer during the second week it must
							be torn out, and that which is torn out must be burnt, and it is
							necessary for a patch to be put on. Rabbi Nehemiah says: a patch is not

							A screen that had colored and white stripes, a nega may effectively

							answer? He replied: If this would confirm the words of the sages, then
							yes! He said back: It is possible that it would remain on it in an
							unchanged condition for two weeks, and that which remains unchanged on
							garments for two weeks is unclean. He said to him: You are a great
							sage, for you have confirmed the words of the sages. A spreading that
							is close to the original nega is effective however small it may be. One
							that is distant is effective only if it is of the size of a split bean.
							And one that reappears is effective only if it is of the size of a

							The warp and the woof can contract the uncleanness of negaim

							bleached. How much must there be in a coil for it to be capable of
							contracting the uncleanness of negaim? Enough to weave from it a piece
							of three fingerbreadths square, either warp or woof, even if it is all
							warp or all woof. If it consisted of broken threads it does not
							contract the uncleanness of negaim. Rabbi Judah says: even if the
							thread was broken only in one place, and he knotted together, it does

							One who winds a thread from one coil to another, or from one spool to

							of a shoe or sandal that are at least as wide as a split bean, Behold
							these are susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim. A thick cloak on
							which a nega appeared: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: unless it appears
							on the texture and on the stuffing. A skin bottle or a shepherd's
							leather wallet are inspected in the position in which they are used,
							and a nega may effectively spread from its inner side to its outer side
							and from its outer side to its inner side.

							All houses may contract negaim uncleanness, except those of non-Jews.
							If one bought houses from non-Jews, any it must be inspected as if they
							had then first appeared. A round house, a triangular house, or a house
							built on a ship, on a raft or on four beams, is not susceptible to

							four pillars, it is susceptible to uncleanness.

							A house, one of whose walls was covered with marble, with rock, with

							wood or earth, and a nega appeared in it and afterwards stones, wood
							and earth were brought into it, it remains clean. So also a garment in
							which there was no woven part that was three fingerbreadths square and
							a nega appeared in it and afterwards there was woven into it a piece of

							not susceptible to negaim uncleanness unless there are in it stones,

							And how many stones must there be in it for it to be susceptible to

							Ishmael used to say: a nega is not a cause of uncleanness unless it
							appeared in the size of two split beans on two stones or on one stone.
							Rabbi Akiva say: unless it appears in the size of two split beans on
							two stones, and not on one stone. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Shimon
							says: unless it appears in the size of two split beans, on two stones,
							on two walls in a corner, Its length being that of two split beans and

							between one row of stones and another. The walls of a cattle-trough or
							the walls of a partition are not susceptible to the uncleanness of
							negaim. A house in Jerusalem or in any place outside the land of Israel

							What is the procedure for the inspection of a house? "The owner of the
							house shall come and tell the priest, saying, "Something like a plague
							has appeared upon my house" (Leviticus 14:35). Even if he is a learned
							sage and knows that it is definitely a nega, he may not speak with
							certainty saying, "A plague has appeared upon my house," but rather,
							"Something like a plague has appeared upon my house." "The priest shall
							order the house cleared before the priest enters to examine the plague,
							so that nothing in the house may become unclean; after that the priest
							shall enter to examine the house." Even bundles of wood and even
							bundles of reeds must be removed, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi
							Shimon said: clearing keeps him occupied. Rabbi Meir said: But which of
							his goods could become unclean? If you were to say, his articles of
							wood, of cloth or of metal, he could immerse them and they will become
							clean. What is it that the Torah has spared? His earthenware, even his
							cruse and his bucket. If the Torah thus spared a man's humble
							possessions, how much more so would it spare his cherished possessions!
							If for his material possessions, how much more so for the life of his
							sons and daughters! If for the possessions of a wicked man, how much
							more so for the possessions of a righteous one!

							The priest must not go into his own house to isolate it, nor may he
							stand within the house in which there is a nega. Rather, he must stand
							at the door of the house in which is there is a nega, and isolate it
							from there, as it is said, "The priest shall come out of the house to
							the entrance of the house, and close up the house for seven days"
							(Leviticus 14:38). He comes again at the end of the week and inspects
							the sign to see if it spread. "The priest shall order the stones with
							the plague in them to be pulled out and cast outside the city into an
							unclean place" (v.. "They shall take other stones and replace those
							stones with them, and take other dirt and plaster the house" (v.. He
							must not take stones from the one side and bring them to the other; nor
							earth from the one side and bring it to the other; nor lime from
							anywhere. He must not bring one stone to replace two, nor two to
							replace one. But he can bring two to replace two or to replace three or
							to replace four. From here they have said: Woe to the wicked, woe to
							his neighbor. Both must take out the stones, both must scrape the
							walls, and both must bring the new stones. He alone, however, brings
							the earth, as it is said, "And he shall take other coating and plaster
							the house." His neighbor need not join with him in the plastering.

							There are ten laws concerning the negaim in houses:(1 + If during the
							first week a nega became faint or disappeared, it must be scraped and
							is then clean. (3 + If during the second week it became faint or
							disappeared, it must be scraped and the owner must bring the birds. If
							it spread during the first week, the stones must be taken out and the
							wall scraped and plastered, and another week must be allowed. If it
							then returned the entire house must be pulled down; If it did not
							return, the birds must be brought. If it remained unchanged during the
							first week but spread during the second week, the stones must be taken
							out and the wall scraped and plastered, and another week must be
							allowed. If it then returned, the house must be pulled down; If it did
							not return the birds must be brought. If it remained unchanged in both
							weeks, the stones must be taken out, and the wall scraped and
							plastered, and a week must be allowed. If it then returned the house
							must be pulled down; If it did not return, the birds must be brought.
							If before cleanness was attained through the birds a new nega appeared,
							the house must be pulled down; But if it appeared after cleanness
							through the birds had been attained, it must be inspected as if it had
							appeared for the first time.

							In the case of a stone in a corner, when the stone is taken out it, he
							must take it all out; But when the house is torn down he tears down his
							own part and leaves that which belongs to his neighbor. Thus it follows
							that there is a greater stringency for taking out than for tearing
							down. Rabbi Eliezer says: if a house is built of rows of head stones
							and small stones, and a nega appears on a head stone, all of it must be
							taken out; but if it appeared on the small stones, he takes out his
							stones and leaves the others.

							A house in which a nega appeared if it had an upper chamber above it,
							the beams are considered part of the upper chamber. If the nega
							appeared in the upper chamber the beams are considered part of the
							lower room. If there was no upper chamber above it, its stones and wood
							and earth must be torn down with it. He may save the frames and the
							window lattices. Rabbi Judah says: a frame that is built over the house
							must be torn down with it. Its stones and wood and earth convey
							uncleanness if they are of the minimum size of an olive. Rabbi Eliezer
							Hisma says: whatever their size.

							If one who builds in cleanliness with stones from a house that was

							If a house overshadowed a house with a nega and so also if a tree
							overshadowed a house with a nega, anyone who enters the outer of the

							house itself cause uncleanness by entering?

							If an unclean person stood under a tree and a clean person passed by,

							If a person who was clean put his head and the greater part of his body

							put even the size of an olive of an unclean cloak into a clean house,

							Rabbi Judah says that they are unclean immediately, But the sages say:
							only after he leaves them there as much time as is required for the
							eating of half a loaf. They said to Rabbi Judah: if when all his body

							How would they purify a metzora? A new earthenware flask and a quarter
							of a log of living water was put in it. Two undomesticated birds are
							also brought. One of these was slaughtered over the earthenware vessel
							and over the living water. A hole was dug and it was buried in his
							presence. Cedarwood, hyssop and scarlet wool were taken and bound
							together with the remaining ends of the strip of wool. Near to these
							were brought the tips of the wings and the tip of the tail of the
							second bird. All were dipped together, and sprinkled upon the back of
							the metzora's hand seven times. Some say that the sprinkling was done
							upon his forehead. In the same manner one would sprinkle on the lintel
							of a house from the outside.

							He now comes to set free the living bird. He does not turn his face
							towards the sea or towards the city or towards the wilderness, for it
							is said, "But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the
							open field" (Leviticus 14:53). He now comes to shave off the hair of
							the metzora. He passes a razor over the whole of his skin, and he the
							metzora washes his clothes and immerses himself. He is then clean so
							far as to not convey uncleanness by entrance, but he still conveys
							uncleanness as does a sheretz. He may enter within the walls of
							Jerusalem, but must keep away from his house for seven days, and he is
							forbidden to have intercourse.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 4 - Negaim: Perek 14: Mishnah 3

							On the seventh day he shaves off his hair a second time in the manner
							of the first shaving, he washes his garments and immerses himself. He
							is clean in so far as not to convey uncleanness as a sheretz, but he
							was still like a tevul yom. He may eat second tithe. After sunset he
							may eat terumah. After he had brought his offering of atonement, he may
							also eat sacred things. Thus there are three grades in the purification
							of a metzora and three grades in the purification of a woman after
							child birth.

							There are three who must shave their hair, and their shaving of it is a

							With regard to the two birds: the commandment is that they be alike in
							appearance, in size and in price; and they must be purchased at the
							same time. But even if they are not alike they are valid; And if one
							was purchased on one day and the other the next they are also valid. If
							after one of the birds had been slaughtered it was found that it was
							not wild, a partner must be purchased for the second, and the first may
							be eaten. If after it had been slaughtered it was found to terefah, a
							partner must be purchased for the second and the first may be made use
							of. If the blood had been spilled out, the bird that was to be let go
							must be left to die. If the one that was to be let go died, the blood
							must be spilled out.

							He comes to the guilt-offering and he puts his two hands on it. He then
							slaughters it. Two priests receive its blood, one in a vessel and the
							other in his hand. He who received it in the vessel proceeded to
							sprinkle it on the wall of the altar. The one who received it in his
							hand would approach the metzora. The metzora had in the meantime
							immersed himself in the chamber of the metzoraim. He would come and
							stand at the Nikanor gate. Rabbi Judah says: he did not require

							The metzora put in his head inside and the priest applied the blood to
							the tip of his ear; He put in his hand and the priest applied the blood
							to the thumb of his hand. He put in his foot and the priest applied the
							blood to the big toe of his foot. Rabbi Judah says: he put in all three
							at the same time. If he had no thumb on his hand or no big toe on his
							foot or no right ear he could never become clean. Rabbi Eliezer says:
							the blood is applied to the place where they were. Rabbi Shimon says:
							if he applied it to the left side, the obligation has been fulfilled.

							The priest then took some of the contents of the log of oil and poured
							it into his colleague's hand; And if he poured it into his own hand,
							the obligation is fulfilled. He then dipped his right forefinger in the
							oil and sprinkled it seven times towards the Holy of Holies, dipping it
							for every sprinkling. He then approached the metzora, to the same
							places that he applied the blood he now applied the oil, as it is said,
							"Over the same places as the blood of the guilt offering; 29 and what
							is left of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the
							one being cleansed, to make expiation for him before the Lord."
							(Leviticus 14:28-29). If he "put upon," he has made atonement, but if
							he did not "put upon," he did not make atonement, the words of Rabbi
							Akiba. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: these are but the remainders of the
							mitzvah. Whether he "put upon" or did not "put upon," atonement is
							made, only it is accounted to him as if he did not make atonement. If
							any oil was missing from the log before it was poured out it may be
							filled up again; if after it was poured out, other oil must be brought
							anew, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon says: if any oil was
							missing from the log before it was applied, it may be filled up; but if
							after it had been applied, other oil must be brought anew.

							If a metzora brought his sacrifice as a poor man and he became rich, or

							Seven days before the burning of the red cow they would separate the

							facing the north-eastern corner of the birah, and which was called the
							Stone Chamber. They would sprinkle upon him throughout the seven days
							with a mixture of all the sin-offerings that were there. Rabbi Yose
							said: they sprinkled upon him only on the third and the seventh days.
							Rabbi Hanina the vice-chief of the priests said: on the priest that was
							to burn the cow they sprinkled all the seven days, but on the one that
							was to perform the service on Yom Kippur they sprinkled on the third

							If insects or creeping things fell into it, and they burst apart or the

							terumah should not be used for sprinkling, but if one had used it for
							sprinkling it is valid. The sprinkling must not be done either with the
							young shoots or with the berries. He is not liable after the sprinkling
							had been done with young shoots for entering the sanctuary. Rabbi
							Eliezer says: also not if it was done with the berries. The following

							Hyssop that is too short may be lengthened with a thread and a

							If he sprinkled upon two vessels and it is doubtful whether he
							sprinkled on both or whether some water from the one dripped on to the
							other, it is invalid. If a needle was on a piece of earthenware and one
							sprinkled upon it, and it is doubtful whether he sprinkled on the
							needle or whether some water dripped on it from the earthenware, his
							sprinkling is invalid. A flask with a narrow mouth, one may dip in and
							draw out in the usual way. Rabbi Judah says: this may be done only for
							the first sprinkling. Hatat waters which were diminished, one may dip
							only the tips of the buds and sprinkle, provided the hyssop does not
							absorb any of the moisture on the sides of the flask. If one intended
							to sprinkle in front of him and he sprinkled behind him, or behind him
							and he sprinkled in front of him, his sprinkling is invalid. If he
							intended to sprinkle in front of him and he sprinkled to the sides in
							front of him, his sprinkling is valid. It is permitted to sprinkle upon

							to sprinkle upon a person and vessels even though there are a hundred

							If he intended to sprinkle upon a thing that is susceptible to

							that is not susceptible to uncleanness and he sprinkled on that which
							is susceptible to uncleanness, even though there was still some water
							on the hyssop, he can sprinkle with it again. If he intended to
							sprinkle upon a man and he sprinkled upon a beast, if any of the water
							remained on the hyssop he should not sprinkle with it again; But if he
							intended to sprinkle upon a beast and he sprinkled upon a man, even
							though there was still some water on the hyssop, he can sprinkle with
							it again. The water that drips off is valid, and therefore it conveys
							uncleanness as the usual hatat waters.

							If one was sprinkling from a window in a public domain and a man who

							priest, however, is exempt, whether the sprinkling upon him was done
							from a private window or from one in a public domain, for a high priest
							is never liable for entering the sanctuary. The people used to slip
							before a certain window in a public domain, and nevertheless they trod

							Rabbi Eliezer says: he who eats food with first degree uncleanness

							be unclean. If a man had an unclean loaf in his hand and he stretched
							it out between clean liquids, and there is doubt whether it touched

							it was whether uncleanness has been conveyed, it is deemed clean." How

							uncleanness unless it is designated for human consumption. How so? If a

							idolater, it becomes susceptible to uncleanness; but if he intended it
							for a dog it is not susceptible to uncleanness. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri
							rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness. If a deaf mute, one not of

							But if they picked it up it becomes susceptible; since only an act of

							If a mikveh was measured and was found lacking in its prescribed

							a lesser uncleanness, for instance if he ate unclean foods or drank
							unclean liquids, or if his head and the greater part of his body
							entered into drawn water, or if three logs of drawn water fell on his

							exists a possibility on which we may depend in declaring it clean. If
							they both contained less than forty seahs, and drawn water fell into
							one of them and it is not known into which of them it fell, in such a

							holding less than forty seahs, and three logs of drawn water fell into
							it, and it was then divided into two, it is invalid, since it had
							already been called invalid. Rabbi Joshua declares it valid, for Rabbi
							Joshua used to say: any mikveh containing less than forty seahs into
							which three logs of drawn water fell and from which a kortov was
							withdrawn becomes valid, since the three logs have also been
							diminished. But the sages say: it always remains invalid until the
							amount of its former contents and a little more are removed.

							is removed and a little more, or until another mikveh containing forty

							If a cistern is full of drawn water and a channel leads into it and out

							poured a log and a half of drawn water into a mikveh, or if one wrung
							out his clothes and so poured in water from several places, or if one
							emptied out a water-jug and so poured in waterfrom several places,
							Rabbi Akiva declares it valid, But the sages declare it invalid. Rabbi
							Akiva said: they did not say "if they poured in," rather "if one poured
							in." But they said: they said neither thus nor thus, but rather "if
							there fell in three logs of drawn water."

							If one put vessels under a water-spout, whether they be large vessels

							if it holds even a little: they have spoken of "a quarter-log" only in

							gravel moved about inside the hollow, it disqualifies the mikveh. If

							If there was a broken earthenware vessel in the mikveh and utensils

							mitzvah from the Torah. The same applies also to the olive's bulk of a
							corpse and the olive's bulk of carrion and the lentil's bulk of a
							sheretz. Anything which remains in the space measuring the tube of a

							Mikvaot may be made clean by joining drawn water from a higher mikveh

							with water; then he draws it along till the two waters touch even if it
							be by a hair's breadth it is sufficient. If in the higher mikveh there

							Some materials raise the mikveh up to the required quantity and do not
							make it invalid. Some make it invalid and do not raise it up to the
							required quantity; And some neither raise it up to the required
							quantity nor make it invalid. These raise it up to the required
							quantity and do not make the mikveh invalid. Snow, hail, frosted dew,
							ice, salt, and thin mud. Rabbi Akiva said: Rabbi Ishmael once argued
							against me saying; snow does not raise up the mikveh to its required
							quantity. But the men of Madeba testified in his name that he had once
							told them: go and bring snow and with it prepare a mikveh from the
							outset. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: hailstones are like drawn water.
							How do they raise it up to the required quantity and not render it
							invalid? If the mikveh contained forty seahs less one, and a se'ah of
							them fell in and made up the required quantity, they thus make up the
							required quantity but do not render it invalid.

							These invalidate the mikveh and do not raise it up to the required

							required quantity? If a mikveh contained forty seahs less a kortov, and
							a kortov of these fell into it, it does not raise it up the required
							quantity; And if there were three logs of any of these, they would
							invalidate the mikveh. But other liquids, and the juice of fruits,
							brine, and liquid in which fish has been pickled, and grape-skin wine
							that has fermented sometimes raise it up to the required quantity and
							sometimes do not raise it up. How so? If a mikveh contained forty seahs
							less one, and a seah of any of these fell in it, it does not raise it
							up to the required quantity. But if the mikveh contained forty seahs
							and a se'ah of any of these was put in and one seah was removed, the

							changed its color, it becomes invalid. What should one do to make it
							valid again? One should wait until the rain falls and the color reverts

							contact with the water and then another person immersed himself in the
							mikveh, he becomes clean. A pillow case or a cushion of leather, as
							soon as it is taken out of the water by its open ends the water which

							it contained hatat waters, it is unclean unless the water of the mikveh

							if a vessel with the capacity of a kor contains but a quarter-log, it
							is as if it had not been immersed.

							All foods combine together to make up the half of a half-loaf which
							makes the body unfit. All liquids combine together to make up the

							mikveh, for in this case they have made all other liquids like water.

							If one ate unclean foods or drank unclean liquids and then he immersed
							and then vomited them up, they are still unclean because they did not
							become clean in the body. If one drank unclean water and immersed and
							then vomited it up, it is clean because it became clean in the body. If
							one swallowed a clean ring and then went into the tent of a corpse, if
							he sprinkled himself once and twice and immersed himself and then
							vomited it up, behold, it remains as it was before. If one swallowed an
							unclean ring, he may immerse himself and eat terumah. If he vomited it
							up, it is unclean and it renders him unclean. If an arrow was stuck
							into a man, it blocks so long as it is visible. But if it is not
							visible, he may immerse himself and eat terumah.

							Shammai says: for all women it suffices to reckon their period of
							uncleanness from their time of discovering the flow. Hillel ruled:
							their period of uncleanness is to be reckoned retroactively from the
							previous examination to the last examination, even if this was many
							days. The sages say: the law is not like the words of these or the
							words of those, but the women are deemed to have been unclean during
							the preceding twenty-four hours when this lessens the period from the
							previous examination to the last examination, and during the period
							from the previous examination to the last examination when this lessens
							the period of twenty-four hours. For any woman who has a regular period
							it suffices to reckon her period of uncleanness from the time she
							discovers the flow. And if a woman uses rags when she has marital
							intercourse, this is like an examination which lessens either the
							period of the past twenty-four hours or the period from the previous
							examination to the last examination.

							How does the rule that it suffices to reckon her period of uncleanness
							from the time she discovers the flow work? If she was sitting on a bed
							and was occupied with ritually clean objects and then she leaves the
							bed and then sees blood flow she is unclean but the objects are clean.
							Even though they have said that she conveys uncleanness for a period of
							twenty-four hours retroactively she counts the seven days of her
							menstruation only from the time she observed the flow.

							Rabbi Eliezer says: there are four types of women for whom it suffices
							to reckon their period of uncleanness from the time of their
							discovering the flow. A virgin, A pregnant woman, A nursing woman; And
							an old woman. Rabbi Joshua says: I have only heard the ruling applied
							to a virgin, but the halakhah is in agreement with Rabbi Eliezer.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 8 - Niddah: Perek 1: Mishnah 4

							Who is regarded as "virgin"? Any woman who has never yet observed a
							blood flow, even if she is married. "A woman in pregnancy"? One whose
							fetus is notice. "A nursing woman"? Until she has weaned her child. If
							she gave her child to a nursing woman, if she weaned him, or if he
							died: Rabbi Meir says: she conveys uncleanness retroactively for
							twenty-four hours; But the sages say: it suffices for her to reckon her
							period of uncleanness from the time of her observation of the flow.

						Seder 6 - Tahorot: Masekhet 8 - Niddah: Perek 1: Mishnah 5

							Who is regarded as "an old woman"? Any woman over whom three "onot"
							have passed near the time of her old age. Rabbi Eliezer says: for any
							woman over whom have passed three onot it suffices to reckon her period
							of uncleanness from the time of her observing a flow. Rabbi Yose says:
							for a woman in pregnancy and a nursing woman over whom three onot have
							passed it suffices to reckon their period of uncleanness from the time
							of their observation of the flow.

							observation she defiles retroactively for a period of twenty-four
							hours. If she saw the first flow on account of an accident even it
							suffices for her even a subsequent observation to reckon her
							uncleanness from the time of her observing of the flow.

							causes uncleanness retrospectively for a period of twenty-four hours
							but she does not cause the man who had intercourse with her to be
							unclean. Rabbi Akiva says: she also causes the man who had intercourse
							with her to be unclean. And the sages agree with Rabbi Akiva that one

							regard to blood discharged in the absence of pain, it was nevertheless
							lenient in regard to blood discharged during hard labor, in a case
							where it was lenient in regard to blood discharged in the absence of
							pain is there not even more reason to be lenient in regard to blood
							discharged during hard labor? He replied: it is enough for the case
							inferred to be treated in the same manner as the one from which it is
							inferred. For in what way were you lenient upon her? From the
							uncleanness of a zivah, but she does have the uncleanness of a niddah.

							All bloodstains that come from Rekem are clean. Rabbi Judah declares

							If a woman observed a bloodstain on her body: If it was opposite her

							she is unclean. On her thigh or on her feet: If on the inner side, she
							is unclean; If on their outer side, she remains clean. And if on the
							front and back sides she remains clean. If she observed it on her
							garment: Below the belt, she is unclean, But if above the belt, she
							remains clean. If she observed it on the sleeve of her shirt: If it can
							reach as low as her genital area, she is unclean, But if it cannot, she
							remains clean. If she takes it off and covers herself with it in the
							night, she is unclean wherever the stain is found, since it can turn
							about. And the same law applies to a pallium.

							attribute the bloodstain to it. How large a stain may be attributed to
							a louse? Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one up to the size of a split
							bean; And even if she did not kill it. She may also attribute it to her
							son or to her husband. If she herself had a wound that could open again

							is clean. Rabbi Judah said: when is this so? When they passed by way of
							the foot of the bed, but if they passed across it, they are all
							unclean. If one of them examined herself and was found clean, she
							remains clean while the two others are unclean. If two examined
							themselves and were found to be clean they remain clean while the third
							is unclean. If the three examined themselves and were found to be
							clean, they are all unclean. To what may this be compared? To an
							unclean heap that was mixed up with two clean heaps: If they examined
							one of them and found it to be clean, it is clean while the two others
							are unclean; If they examined two of the heaps and found them to be
							clean, they are clean while the third one is unclean; And if they
							examined the three and they were all found to be clean, they are all

							Seven substances should be applied to a stain: tasteless spittle, the

							potash. If one immersed it and then handled clean things on it, and
							then applied to it the seven substances and the stain did not fade away
							it must be a dye, and the clean things remain clean and there is no
							need to immerse it again. If the stain faded away or grew fainter, it

							prescribed order, or if he applied the seven substances simultaneously,
							he has done nothing.

							For any woman who has a regular period it suffices to reckon her period
							of uncleanness from the time she discovers the flow. And these are the
							signs of a regular period: if the woman yawns, sneezes, feels pain at
							the top of her stomach or the bottom of her bowels, discharges mucus,
							or is seized by a kind of shivering, or any other similar symptoms. Any
							woman who established for herself one of the symptoms three times

							while the symptoms were in progress are unclean. But if she regularly
							observed them at the end of the symptoms, all clean things that she
							handled while the symptoms lasted remain clean. Rabbi Yose says: even

							blood flow at sunrise she is forbidden intercourse at sunrise only.

							a regular period, it suffices to reckon her period of uncleanness from
							the time she discovers the flow. Rabbi Judah says: Any woman who did
							not ascertain her separation from impurity is regarded as being in a

							examined herself on the second day of her menstruation and found that

							If a zav, a zavah, a niddah, a woman after childbirth or a metzora have

							A woman's milk renders unclean whether its flow is desired or is not
							desired, but the milk of cattle renders unclean only if its flow is
							desired. Rabbi Akiva said: there is a kal vehomer argument here: if a
							woman's milk, which is specifically for infants, can render unclean
							whether its flow is desired or is not desired, all the more should the
							milk of cattle, which is for infants and adults, should render unclean
							both when its flow is desired and when it is not desired. They said to
							him: No; a woman's milk renders unclean when its flow is not desired,
							because the blood issuing from her wound is unclean; but how could the
							milk of cattle render unclean when its flow is not desired, seeing that
							the blood issuing from its wound is clean? He said to them: I am
							stricter in the case of milk than in the case of blood, for if one
							milks for healing, the milk is unclean, whereas if one lets blood for
							healing, the blood is clean. They said to him: let baskets of olives
							and grapes prove it; for liquids flowing from them are unclean only
							when the flow is desired, but when the flow is not desired they are
							clean. He said to them: No; if you say thus of baskets of olives and
							grapes which are at first a solid food and at the end become a liquid,
							could you say the same of milk which remains a liquid from beginning to
							end? Thus far was the argument. Rabbi Shimon said: from here on in we
							used to argue before him: let rain water prove it, for it remains a
							liquid from beginning to end, and renders unclean only when its flow is
							desired. But he said to us: No; if you say thus of rain water, it is
							because most of it is intended not for human usage but for the soil and
							for trees, whereas most milk is intended for human usage.

							whether he saw it on the second day or on the third day: Bet Shammai
							says: it undoes the two preceding days; And Bet Hillel says: it undoes
							only that day. But they agree that if he saw it on the fourth day of

							carried, whether he had jumped, whether he had been ill, what he had
							seen, or what he had thought. It doesn't matter whether he had thoughts
							before seeing a woman, or whether he had seen a woman before his
							thoughts. Rabbi Judah says: even if he had watched beasts, wild animals
							or birds having intercourse with each other, and even when he had seen
							a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva says: even if he had eaten any
							kind of food, be it good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. They
							said to him: Then there will be no zavim in the world!’ He replied to
							them: you are not held responsible for the existence of zavim!’ Once he
							had become subject to zivah, no further examination takes place. Zov
							resulting from an accident, or that was at all doubtful, or an issue of
							semen, these are unclean, since there are grounds for the assumption
							that it is zivah. If he had at a first issue they examine him; On the
							second issue they examine him, but on the third issue they don't
							examine him. Rabbi Eliezer says: even on the third issue they examine
							him because of the sacrifice.

							One who had a discharge of semen does not defile due to zivah for a

							experienced difficulty in childbirth, the time prescribed is
							twenty-four hours. One who strikes his slave, the "day or two" is
							twenty-four hours. A dog that eats a corpse's flesh, for three days

							pulled the other way. If they were both weaving together, whether they

							A zav who lays across five benches, or five money-belts: If lengthwise,
							he makes them unclean; But breadthwise, they are clean. If he slept on
							them, and it was doubful that he had turned over onto them, they are
							unclean. If he was lying on six seats, with two hands on two seats, two
							feet on another two, his head on one, with his body on another one,
							only that one on which his body lay is rendered unclean. If a zav stood
							on two seats: Rabbi Shimon says: if these were distant one from the
							other, they remain clean.

							Ten cloaks one on top of the other, if he sat on the uppermost one, all
							are unclean. A zav who was on one scale of a balance and in the other
							scale opposite there were objects fit to sit or lie upon: If the zav
							pushed them up, they are clean. But if they pushed him up, they are
							unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: if there was one object it becomes unclean,
							but if there were many they remain clean, since none of them had borne
							the greater part of the zav's weight.

							If a zav sat in one scale of the balance, while food and liquids were
							in the other scale, the latter become unclean. In the case of a corpse,
							everything remains clean except for a man. This is an example of the
							greater stringency applying to a zav than to a corpse; and there is a
							greater stringency in the case of a corpse than a zav. For whereas the
							zav defiles all objects on which he sits or lies upon, so that these
							likewise convey uncleanness to people and garments, and he conveys to
							what is above him madaf uncleanness, so that these in turn defile food
							and liquids. Whereas in the case of a corpse no such uncleanness is
							conveyed. Greater stringency is also found in the case of a corpse,
							since it can convey uncleanness by overshadowing, and it defiles seven
							days’ defilement, whereas in the case of a zav no such uncleanness is
							conveyed.

							One who touches a zav, or whom a zav touches, who moves a zav or whom a
							zav moves, defiles by contact food and liquids and vessels that are
							rinsed, but not by carrying. A general principle was stated by Rabbi
							Joshua: anyone that defile garments while still in contact with their
							source of uncleanness also defiles foods and liquids so as to become
							unclean in the first grade, and the hands so that they become unclean
							in the second grade; but they do not defile people or earthenware
							vessels. After they separated from their source of uncleanness they
							defile liquids so as to become unclean in the first grade, and food and
							the hands so that they become unclean in the second grade, but they do
							not defile garments.

							They said yet another general principle: All that is carried above a
							zav becomes defiled, but all those things above which he is carried are
							clean except objects on which he can sit or lie upon, and a person. How
							so? If a zav had his finger beneath a layer of stones and one that was
							clean was above, he conveys uncleanness at two degrees of remove and
							disqualifies terumah at one further remove. If he separated from the
							source of uncleanness he still defiles at one remove and disqualifies
							terumah at yet one further remove. If the unclean one was above, and
							the clean person below, he defiles at two removes, and disqualifies
							terumah at yet one further remove. If he separated from the source of
							uncleanness, he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at yet
							one more remove. If foods or liquids, or objects on which he could sit
							or lie upon or other articles were above, they defile at one remove,
							and disqualify terumah at one further remove. If they had become
							separated from the source of uncleanness, they defile at one remove and
							disqualify terumah at one more remove. All objects fit to sit or lie
							upon that were below defile at two removes, and disqualify terumah at
							one more remove. If they had become separate from the source of
							uncleanness, they defile at two removes and disqualify terumah at one
							more remove Foods and liquids and other articles that are below, remain

							If part of an unclean person rests upon a clean person, or part of a

							unclean person rest upon a clean person, or if things connected to a
							clean person upon one unclean, he becomes unclean. Rabbi Shimon says:
							if part of an unclean person is upon a clean person, he is unclean; but
							if part of a clean person is upon one that is unclean, he is clean.

							If an unclean person rests upon part of an object fit to lie upon, or a

							upon, or part of a clean person rests upon an object fit to lie upon,
							it remains clean. Thus we find that impurity enters it and goes out of
							it by its lesser part. Similarly, if a loaf of terumah was placed upon
							an object fit to lie upon that was unclean and there paper in between,
							whether it was above or below, it remains clean. Similarly, in the case
							of a stone with scale disease it remains clean. Rabbi Shimon pronounced

							If a person puts his hands inside a house with scale disease, his hands

							But the sages say: such that they have second degree of uncleanness.
							They said to Rabbi Akiba: where do we find anywhere that hands have
							first degree uncleanness? He said to them: but how is it possible for
							them to become unclean with first degree uncleanness without his whole
							body becoming unclean? Only in these cases can they have first degree
							uncleanness. Foods and vessels which have been defiled by liquids
							convey second degree of uncleanness to the hands, the words of Rabbi

							On that day they said: what is the law applying to Ammon and Moab in

							Elazar ben Azariah decreed second tithe. Rabbi Ishmael said: Elazar ben
							Azariah, you must produce your proof because you are expressing the
							stricter view and whoever expresses a stricter view has the burden to
							produce the proof. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said to him: Ishmael, my
							brother, I have not deviated from the sequence of years, Tarfon, my
							brother, has deviated from it and the burden is upon him to produce the
							proof. Rabbi Tarfon answered: Egypt is outside the land of Israel,
							Ammon and Moab are outside the land of Israel: just as Egypt must give
							tithe for the poor in the seventh year, so must Ammon and Moab give
							tithe for the poor in the seventh year. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah
							answered: Babylon is outside the land of Israel, Ammon and Moab are
							outside the land of Israel: just as Babylon must give second tithe in
							the seventh year, so must Ammon and Moab give second tithe in the
							seventh year. Rabbi Tarfon said: on Egypt which is near, they imposed
							tithe for the poor so that the poor of Israel might be supported by it
							during the seventh year; so on Ammon and Moab which are near, we should
							impose tithe for the poor so that the poor of Israel may be supported
							by it during the seventh year. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said to him:
							Behold, you are like one who would benefit them with gain, yet you are
							really as one who causes them to perish. Would you rob the heavens so
							that dew or rain should not descend? As it is said, "Will a man rob
							God? Yet you rob me. But you: How have we robbed You? In tithes and
							heave-offerings" (Malakhi 3:8). Rabbi Joshua said: Behold, I shall be
							as one who replies on behalf of Tarfon, my brother, but not in
							accordance with the substance of his arguments. The law regarding Egypt
							is a new act and the law regarding Babylon is an old act, and the law
							which is being argued before us is a new act. A new act should be
							argued from another new act, but a new act should not be argued from an
							old act. The law regarding Egypt is the act of the elders and the law
							regarding Babylon is the act of the prophets, and the law which is
							being argued before us is the act of the elders. Let one act of the
							elders be argued from another act of the elders, but let not an act of
							the elders be argued from an act of the prophets. The votes were
							counted and they decided that Ammon and Moab should give tithe for the
							poor in the seventh year. And when Rabbi Yose ben Durmaskit visited
							Rabbi Eliezer in Lod he said to him: what new thing did you have in the
							house of study today? He said to him: their votes were counted and they
							decided that Ammon and Moab must give tithe for the poor in the seventh
							year. Rabbi Eliezer wept and said: "The counsel of the Lord is with
							them that fear him: and his covenant, to make them know it" (Psalms
							25:14). Go and tell them: Don't worry about your voting. I received a
							tradition from Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai who heard it from his teacher,
							and his teacher from his teacher, and so back to a halachah given to
							Moses from Sinai, that Ammon and Moab must give tithe for the poor in
							the seventh year.

							of the Lord: even to the tenth generation" (Deuteronomy 23:4). R.
							Joshua said to him: But are the Ammonites and Moabites still in their

							and mingled all the nations, as it is said: "In that I have removed the
							bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have

							Gamaliel said to him: the verse says, "But afterward I will bring back

							That which serves as a handle but does not protect, both contracts
							uncleanness and conveys uncleanness; but it is not included. If it
							protects but is not a handle, it contracts and conveys uncleanness and
							is included. If it neither protects nor serves as a handle, it neither
							contracts nor conveys uncleanness.

							Roots of garlic, onions or leeks that are still moist, or their
							top-parts, whether they are moist or dry, also the central stalk that
							is within the edible part, the roots of lettuce, the radish and the
							turnip, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: only the large roots
							of the radish are included, but its fibrous roots are not included. The
							roots of the mint, rue, wild herbs and garden herbs that have been
							uprooted in order to be planted elsewhere, and the spine of an ear of
							grain, and its husk. Rabbi Elazar says: also the earth covering of
							roots; All these things contract and convey impurity and are included.

							The following are both defiled and defile, but do not join together
							together with the rest: Roots of garlic, onions or leeks when they are
							dry, the stalk that is not within the edible part, the twig of a vine a
							handbreadth long on either side, the stem of the cluster whatsoever be
							its length, the tail of the cluster bereft of grapes, the stem of the
							‘broom’ of the palm-tree to a length of four handbreadths, the stalk of
							the ear of grain to a length of three handbreadths, and the stalk of
							all things that are cut, to the length of three handbreadths. In the
							case of those things not usually cut, their stalks and roots of any
							size whatsoever. As for the outer husks of grains, they defile and are
							defiled, but do not join together.

							The following neither defile nor can they be defiled and they do not
							join together: The roots of cabbage-stalks, Young shoots of beet
							growing out of the root, and similar such turnip-heads, And produce
							whose roots that are ordinarily cut off but in this case were pulled up
							with their roots. Rabbi Yose declares them all susceptible to contract
							uncleanness, but he declares insusceptible cabbage-stalks and
							turnip-heads.

							Stalks of all foods that have been threshed on the threshing-floor are
							clean. Rabbi Yose declares them unclean. A sprig of a vine when
							stripped of its grapes is clean, but if one grape alone is left on it,
							it is unclean. A twig of a date-tree stripped of its dates is clean,
							but if one date remains on it, it is unclean. Similarly, with beans, if
							the pods were stripped from the stem it is clean, but if even one pod
							alone remains, it is unclean. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah declares the
							stalk of the broad bean clean, but declares unclean the stalk of other
							beans, since it is of use when the pulse is handled.

							Leaves of olives pickled together with the olives remain clean, for
							their pickling was only for the sake of appearances. The fibrous
							substance on a zucchini and the flower-like substance on it are clean.
							Rabbi Judah says: that as long as it is still before the merchant, it
							is unclean.

							All kinds of pits can be defiled and defile but do not join together.
							The pits of fresh dates, even when detached from the edible part, do
							join together; but those of dried dates do not join together.
							Accordingly, the stems of dried dates do join together, but that of
							fresh dates do not join together. If only part of a pit is detached,
							then only that part near the edible portion joins together. Similarly
							with a bone on which there is flesh, only that part that is close to
							the edible part joins together. If a bone has flesh only upon one of
							its sides: Rabbi Ishmael says: we take it as though the flesh
							encompasses it like a ring; But the sages say: only that part close to
							the edible part is included as is the case for example with savory,
							hyssop and thyme.

							If a pomegranate or melon has rotted in part, what is rotten does not
							join together. And if the fruit is sound at either end but has rotted
							in the middle, what is rotten does not join together. The stem of a
							pomegranate does join together, but the fibrous substance in it does
							not join together. Rabbi Elazar says: also the comb is not susceptible
							to uncleanness.

							All kinds of peels defile and are defiled, and join together. Rabbi
							Judah says: an onion has three skins: the innermost one whether it is
							in its entire state or whether it be pierced with holes joins together;
							the middle one when it is in a whole state joins together, but when it
							is pierced with holes does not join together; the outermost skin is in
							either case insusceptible to uncleanness.

							If one chops up fruit for cooking, even if the chopping had not been
							completely finished, it is not regarded as connected. If his intention
							had been to pickle or to boil it, or to set it on the table, then it is
							regarded as connected. If he began to take the pieces apart, only that
							part of the food which he began to take apart is not considered
							connected. Nuts that had been strung together, or onions that had been
							piled together, count as connected. If he began to take the nuts apart,
							or to strip the onions, they are not connected. Shells of nuts and
							almonds are considered connected with the edible part until they are
							crushed.

							The shell of a roasted egg is considered connected until it is cracked.
							That of a hard-boiled egg is considered connected until it is entirely
							broken up. A marrow-bone serves as connected until it is wholly
							crushed. A pomegranate that has been divided into sections is connected
							until it has been knocked with a stick. Similarly, loose stitches of
							laundrymen or a garment that had been stitched together with threads of
							kilayim, are connected until one begins to loosen them.

							The outer leaves of vegetables: if they are green they join together,
							but if they have whitened they not join together. Rabbi Elazar bar
							Zadok says: the white leaves of cabbage join together because they are
							edible. So also those of lettuces, because they preserve the edible
							part.

							Onion leaves or the offshoots of onions, if there is moisture in them
							they are to be measured as they are; if there is empty space within
							them, it must be squeezed tightly together. Spongy bread is measured as
							it is, but if there is empty space within it, it must be pressed
							firmly. The flesh of a calf which had swollen, or the flesh of an old
							beast that has shrunken in size, are measured in the condition they are
							in.

							A cucumber planted in a pot which grew until it was out of the pot is
							pure. Rabbi Shimon said: what is its nature to make it clean? Rather,
							that which has already become unclean remains unclean, and only that
							which is pure can be eaten.

							Some things need to be rendered susceptible to uncleanness but they do
							not need intention, Other things need intention and to be rendered
							susceptible. Other things need intention, but do not need to be
							rendered susceptible, And other things need neither to be rendered
							susceptible nor intention. Any food that is meant for people need to be
							rendered susceptible, but does not need intention.

							That which has been severed from a human, beast, wild animal, bird, or
							from the carrion of an unclean bird, and the fat in villages. And all
							kinds of wild vegetables, except for truffles and mushrooms; Rabbi
							Judah says, except for field-leeks, purslane and ornithagolum. And
							Rabbi Shimon says: except for cynara sycaria. Rabbi Yose says: except
							for muscari comusum. Behold all these need both intention and to be
							rendered susceptible to uncleanness.

							The carrion of an unclean beast at all places, and of a clean bird in
							villages, need intention but do not need to be rendered susceptible.
							The carrion of a clean beast in all places, and that of a clean bird
							and also fat in the market places, require neither intention nor to be
							rendered susceptible. Rabbi Shimon says: also the carrion of the camel,
							rabbit, hare or pig.

							The aneth stalk after having given its taste to a dish is no longer
							subject to the laws of terumah, and also no longer imparts food
							uncleanness. The young sprouts of hawthorn, of lapidum, or leaves of
							the wild arum, do not impart food uncleanness until they are sweetened.
							Rabbi Shimon says: also the leaves of the colocynth are like them.

							Costus, amomum, principal spices, roots of crowfoot, asafoetida, pepper
							and lozenges made of saffron may be bought with tithe money, but they
							do not convey food uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yohanan
							ben Nuri to him: if they may be bought with second tithe money, then
							why should they not impart food uncleanness? And if they do not impart
							food uncleanness, then they should also not be bought with second tithe
							money?

							Unripe figs or grapes: Rabbi Akiva says: they convey food uncleanness;
							Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: this is only when they have reached the
							season when they are liable to tithes. Olives and grapes that have
							hardened: Bet Shammai says: they are susceptible to uncleanness, Bet
							Hillel says: they are insusceptible. Black cumin: Bet Shammai says: is
							not susceptible, Bet Hillel says: it is susceptible. Similarly they
							dispute with regard to their liability to tithes.

							The heart of a palm is like wood in every respect, except that it may

							When do fish become susceptible to uncleanness? Bet Shammai say: after
							they have been caught. Bet Hillel say: only after they are dead. Rabbi
							Akiva says: if they can still live. If a branch of a fig tree was
							broken off, but it was still attached by its bark: Rabbi Judah says:
							the fruit is still not susceptible to uncleanness. But the sages say:
							it all depends whether they could still live. Grain that had been
							uprooted, but is still attached to the soil even by the smallest of
							roots, is not susceptible to uncleanness.

							The fat of the carcass of a clean beast is not regarded as unclean with
							carrion uncleanness; for this reason it must first be made susceptible.
							The fat of an unclean beast, however, is regarded as unclean with
							carrion uncleanness; for this reason it need not be made at first
							susceptible. As for unclean fish and unclean locusts, intention is
							required in villages.

							A bee-hive: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is treated as if it were land; and
							one can write a prozbul on it security, it is also not susceptible to
							uncleanness as long as it remains in its own place, and the one who
							scrapes honey from it on Shabbat is liable to a sin-offering. But the
							sages say: it is not to be treated as if it were land, and one many not
							write a prozbul on its security; it is susceptible even if it remains
							in its own place; and the one who scrapes honey from it on Shabbat is
							exempt from a sin-offering.

							When do honeycombs become susceptible to uncleanness on account of
							their being regarded as liquids? Bet Shammai says: from the moment he
							begins to smoke the bees out. But Bet Hillel says: once he breaks up
							the honeycomb.

							Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: In the world to come the Holy One,
							Blessed be He, will make each righteous person inherit three hundred
							and ten worlds, for it is written: "That I may cause those that love me
							to inherit yesh (numerical value of; and that I may fill their
							treasuries" (Proverbs 8:21. Rabbi Shimon ben Halafta said: the Holy
							One, Blessed be He, found no vessel that could contain blessing for
							Israel save that of peace, as it is written: "The Lord will give
							strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace"
							(Psalms 29:11).
