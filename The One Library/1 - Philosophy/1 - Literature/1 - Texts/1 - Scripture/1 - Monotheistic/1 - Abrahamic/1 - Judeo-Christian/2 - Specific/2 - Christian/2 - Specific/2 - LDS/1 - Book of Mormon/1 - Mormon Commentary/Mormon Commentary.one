					Description

						Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and
						also of the Lamanites - Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the
						house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile - Written by way of
						commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation - Written
						and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed -
						To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof
						- Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in
						due time by way of the Gentile - The interpretation thereof by the gift of
						God.

					-
						An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the
						people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the
						language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven -
						Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things
						the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants
						of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever - nd also to the convincing
						of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God,
						manifesting himself unto all nations - And now, if there are faults they
						are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye
						may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.
