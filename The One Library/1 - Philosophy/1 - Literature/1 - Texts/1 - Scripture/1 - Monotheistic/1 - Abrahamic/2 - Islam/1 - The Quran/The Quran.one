			Surah 2 - The Cow
		-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 0
			-
				-
					In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					Alif, Lam, Meem.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					Those who believe in the unseen, and perform the prayers, and give from what We
					have provided for them.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					And those who believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed
					before you, and are certain of the Hereafter.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					These are upon guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					As for those who disbelieve-it is the same for them, whether you have warned
					them, or have not warned them-they do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their vision
					is a veil. They will have a severe torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					Among the people are those who say, "We believe in God and in the Last Day,"
					but they are not believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					They seek to deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive none but
					themselves, though they are not aware.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					In their hearts is sickness, and God has increased their sickness. They will
					have a painful punishment because of their denial.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Do not make trouble on earth," they say, "We are
					only reformers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they are not aware.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say,
					"Shall we believe as the fools have believed?" In fact, it is they who are the
					fools, but they do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And when they come across those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when
					they are alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we were only
					ridiculing."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					It is God who ridicules them, and leaves them bewildered in their
					transgression.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					Those are they who have bartered error for guidance; but their trade does not
					profit them, and they are not guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					Their likeness is that of a person who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all
					around him, God took away their light, and left them in darkness, unable to
					see.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which is darkness, and thunder, and
					lightning. They press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in
					fear of death. But God surrounds the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					The lightning almost snatches their sight away. Whenever it illuminates for
					them, they walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, they stand still. Had
					God willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. God is
					capable of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					O people! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may
					attain piety.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends
					water down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for
					you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to God while you know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then
					produce a chapter like these, and call your witnesses apart from God, if you
					are truthful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					But if you do not-and you will not-then beware the Fire whose fuel is people
					and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds; that they will
					have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit
					therefrom as sustenance, they will say, "This is what we were provided with
					before," and they will be given the like of it. And they will have pure spouses
					therein, and they will abide therein forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					God does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it.
					As for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But
					as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did God intend by this example?"
					He leads astray many thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He misleads
					thereby only the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Those who violate God's covenant after its confirmation, and sever what God has
					commanded to be joined, and commit evil on earth. These are the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					How can you deny God, when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will put
					you to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					It is He who created for you everything on earth, then turned to the heaven,
					and made them seven heavens. And He is aware of all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					When your Lord said to the angels, "I am placing a successor on earth." They
					said, "Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed
					blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?" He said, "I know what
					you do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the
					angels, and said, "Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					They said, "Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught
					us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					He said, "Adam, tell them their names." And when he told them their names, He
					said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth,
					and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam." They bowed down, except for
					Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					We said, "Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely
					as you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					But Satan caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they
					were in. We said, "Go down, some of you enemies of one another. And you will
					have residence on earth, and enjoyment for a while."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him. He is the
					Relenting, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					We said, "Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from
					Me, then whoever follows My guidance-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they
					grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs-these are the inmates of
					the Fire-wherein they will remain forever."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					O Children of Israel! Remember My blessings which I bestowed upon you, and
					fulfill your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge to you, and fear Me.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					And believe in what I revealed, confirming what is with you; and do not be the
					first to deny it; and do not exchange My revelations for a small price; and be
					conscious of Me.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And do not mix truth with falsehood, and do not conceal the truth while you
					know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And attend to your prayers, and practice regular charity, and kneel with those
					who kneel.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Do you command people to virtuous conduct, and forget yourselves, even though
					you read the Scripture? Do you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And seek help through patience and prayer. But it is difficult, except for the
					devout.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Those who know that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they will
					return.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I
					favored you over all nations.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another in the least, nor will any
					intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any ransom be taken from it,
					nor will they be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And recall that We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on
					you terrible persecution, killing your sons and sparing your women. Therein was
					a tremendous trial from your Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					And recall that We parted the sea for you, so We saved you, and We drowned the
					people of Pharaoh as you looked on.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					And recall that We appointed for Moses forty nights. Then you took to
					worshiping the calf after him, and you turned wicked.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Then We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					And recall that We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion, so that you may
					be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					And recall that Moses said to his people, "my people, you have done wrong to
					yourselves by worshiping the calf. So repent to your Maker, and kill your egos.
					That would be better for you with your Maker." So He turned to you in
					repentance. He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					And recall that you said, "Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see God
					plainly." Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you, as you looked on.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Then We revived you after your death, so that you may be appreciative.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails: "Eat
					of the good things We have provided for you." They did not wrong Us, but they
					used to wrong their own souls.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And recall that We said, "Enter this town, and eat plentifully from it whatever
					you wish; but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' We will forgive your
					sins, and give increase to the virtuous."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					But the wrongdoers among them substituted words other than those given to them,
					so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, because of their wicked
					behavior.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					And recall when Moses prayed for water for his people. We said, "Strike the
					rock with your staff." Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from it, and each
					tribe recognized its drinking-place. "Eat and drink from God's provision, and
					do not corrupt the earth with disobedience."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					And recall when you said, "Moses, we cannot endure one kind of food, so call to
					your Lord to produce for us of what the earth grows: of its herbs, and its
					cucumbers, and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions." He said, "Would
					you substitute worse for better? Go down to Egypt, where you will have what you
					asked for." They were struck with humiliation and poverty, and incurred wrath
					from God. That was because they rejected God's revelations and wrongfully
					killed the prophets. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and the
					Sabeans-any who believe in God and the Last Day, and act righteously-will have
					their reward with their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					And recall when We received a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you:
					"Take what We have given you earnestly, and remember what is in it, that you
					may attain righteousness."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					But after that you turned away. Were it not for God's grace and mercy towards
					you, you would have been among the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					And you surely knew those of you who violated the Sabbath. We said to them, "Be
					despicable apes!"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Thus We made it a deterrent for their generation, and for subsequent
					generations, and a lesson for the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					And recall when Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a
					heifer." They said, "Do you make a mockery of us?" He said, "God forbid that I
					should be so ignorant."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us which one." He said, "He says she is
					a heifer, neither too old, nor too young, but in between. So do what you are
					commanded."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what her color is." He said, "He
					says she is a yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the beholders."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us which one; the heifers look alike to
					us; and God willing, we will be guided."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					He said, "He says she is a heifer, neither yoked to plow the earth, nor to
					irrigate the field; sound without blemish." They said, "Now you have brought
					the truth." So they slew her; though they almost did not.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					And recall when you killed a person, and disputed in the matter; but God was to
					expose what you were hiding.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					We said, "Strike him with part of it." Thus God brings the dead to life; and He
					shows you His signs, that you may understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Then after that your hearts hardened. They were as rocks, or even harder. For
					there are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others that splinter and
					water comes out from them, and others that sink in awe of God. God is not
					unaware of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Do you hope that they will believe in you, when some of them used to hear the
					Word of God, and then deliberately distort it, even after understanding it?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					And when they come across those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when
					they come together privately, they say, "Will you inform them of what God has
					disclosed to you, so that they might dispute with you concerning it before your
					Lord?" Do you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Do they not know that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					And among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay, and
					they only speculate.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say,
					"This is from God," that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them
					for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And they say, "The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days." Say,
					"Have you received a promise from God-God never breaks His promise-or are you
					saying about God what you do not know?"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and becomes besieged by his iniquities-these
					are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					As for those who believe and do righteous deeds-these are the inhabitants of
					Paradise, wherein they will dwell forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: "Worship none but God; and be
					good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and the needy; and speak nicely to
					people; and pray regularly, and give alms." Then you turned away, except for a
					few of you, recanting.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					And We made a covenant with you: "You shall not shed the blood of your own, nor
					shall you evict your own from your homes." You agreed, and were all witnesses.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					But here you are, killing your own, and expelling a group of your own from
					their homes-conspiring against them in wrongdoing and hostility. And if they
					come to you as captives, you ransom them, although it was forbidden to you. Is
					it that you believe in part of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What is
					the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? And on
					the Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to the most severe torment. God
					is not unaware of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment
					will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a succession of messengers after him. And
					We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy
					Spirit. Is it that whenever a messenger comes to you with anything your souls
					do not desire, you grew arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing others?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					And they said, "Our hearts are sealed." Rather, God has cursed them for their
					ingratitude. They have little faith.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					And when a scripture came to them from God, confirming what they have-although
					previously they were seeking victory against those who disbelieved-but when
					there came to them what they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So God's curse
					is upon the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Miserable is what they sold their souls for-rejecting what God has revealed,
					out of resentment that God would send down His grace upon whomever He chooses
					from among His servants. Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a
					demeaning punishment for the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Believe in what God has revealed," they say, "We
					believe in what was revealed to us," and they reject anything beyond that,
					although it is the truth which confirms what they have. Say, "Why did you kill
					God's prophets before, if you were believers?"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence,
					and you were in the wrong.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					And We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: "Take what We
					have given you firmly, and listen." They said, "We hear and disobey." And their
					hearts became filled with the love of the calf because of their disbelief. Say,
					"Wretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					Say, "If the Final Home with God is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other
					people, then wish for death if you are sincere."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded.
					God is aware of the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the
					polytheists. Every one of them wishes he could live a thousand years; but to be
					granted a long life will not nudge him from the punishment. God is Seeing of
					what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					Say, "Whoever is hostile to Gabriel-it is he who revealed it to your heart by
					God's leave, confirming what preceded it, and guidance and good news for the
					believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					Whoever is hostile to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and
					Michael-God is hostile to the faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Is it not that whenever they make a covenant, some of them toss it aside? In
					fact, most of them do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					And when there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what they had, a
					faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of God behind their
					backs, as if they do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					And they followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. It was
					not Solomon who disbelieved, but it was the devils who disbelieved. They taught
					the people witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon to the two angels Harut
					and Marut. They did not teach anybody until they had said, "We are a test, so
					do not lose faith." But they learned from them the means to cause separation
					between man and his wife. But they cannot harm anyone except with God's
					permission. And they learned what would harm them and not benefit them. Yet
					they knew that whoever deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter.
					Miserable is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.

				-
					Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from God would have been

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and
					listen. The disbelievers will have a painful torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					It is never the wish of the disbelievers from among the People of the Book, nor
					of the polytheists, that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord.
					But God chooses for His mercy whomever He wills. God is Possessor of Sublime
					Grace.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one
					better than it, or similar to it. Do you not know that God is capable of all
					things?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Do you not know that to God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the
					earth, and that apart from God you have no guardian or helper?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before?
					Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back into unbelievers after you
					have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear to
					them. But pardon and overlook, until God brings His command. God has power over
					all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					And perform the prayer, and give alms. Whatever good you forward for
					yourselves, you will find it with God. God is Seeing of everything you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					And they say, "None will enter Heaven unless he is a Jew or a Christian." These
					are their wishes. Say, "Produce your proof, if you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					In fact, whoever submits himself to God, and is a doer of good, will have his
					reward with his Lord-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					The Jews say, "The Christians are not based on anything;" and the Christians
					say, "The Jews are not based on anything." Yet they both read the Scripture.
					Similarly, the ignorant said the same thing. God will judge between them on the
					Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					Who is more unjust than him who forbids the remembrance of God's name in places
					of worship, and contributes to their ruin? These ought not to enter them except
					in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a terrible
					punishment in the Hereafter.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					To God belong the East and the West. Whichever way you turn, there is God's
					presence. God is Omnipresent and Omniscient.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					And they say, "God has begotten a son." Be He glorified. Rather, His is
					everything in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					Originator of the heavens and the earth. Whenever He decrees a thing, He says

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					Those who do not know say, "If only God would speak to us, or a sign would come
					to us." Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike. We have
					made the signs clear for people who are certain.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					We have sent you with the truth-bringing good news, and giving warnings. You
					will not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their
					creed. Say, "God's guidance is the guidance." Should you follow their desires,
					after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have in God neither guardian
					nor helper.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be
					followed-these believe in it. But as for those who reject it-these are the
					losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					O Children of Israel! Remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that
					I have favored you over all people.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another soul in any way, and no
					ransom will be accepted from it, and no intercession will benefit it, and they
					will not be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He
					said, "I am making you a leader of humanity." He said, "And my descendants?" He
					said, "My pledge does not include the wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					And We made the House a focal point for the people, and a sanctuary. Use the
					shrine of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We commissioned Abraham and
					Ishmael, "Sanctify My House for those who circle around it, and those who
					seclude themselves in it, and those who kneel and prostrate."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					When Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and provide its people
					with fruits-whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day." He said, "And
					whoever disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, then I will consign
					him to the punishment of the Fire; how miserable the destiny!"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					As Abraham raises the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael, "Our
					Lord, accept it from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, and from our descendants a community
					submissive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are
					the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 129
			-
				-
					Our Lord, and raise up among them a messenger, of themselves, who will recite
					to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them.
					You are the Almighty, the Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 130
			-
				-
					Who would forsake the religion of Abraham, except he who fools himself? We
					chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 131
			-
				-
					When his Lord said to him, "Submit!" He said, "I have submitted to the Lord of
					the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 132
			-
				-
					And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Jacob, "my sons, God has chosen this
					religion for you, so do not die unless you have submitted."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 133
			-
				-
					Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, and he said to his sons,
					"What will you worship after Me?" They said, "We will worship your God, and the
					God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; One God; and to Him we
					submit."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 134
			-
				-
					That was a community that has passed; for them is what they have earned, and
					for you is what you have earned; and you will not be questioned about what they
					used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 135
			-
				-
					And they say, "Be Jews or Christians, and you will be guided." Say, "Rather,
					the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an idolater."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 136
			-
				-
					Say, "We believe in God; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was
					revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and
					in what was given to Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the
					prophets-from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to
					Him we surrender."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 137
			-
				-
					If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been
					guided. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. God will protect you
					against them; for He is the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 138
			-
				-
					God's coloring. And who gives better coloring than God? "And we are devoted to
					Him."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 139
			-
				-
					Say, "Do you argue with us about God, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We
					have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?"
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 140
			-
				-
					Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews
					or Christians? Say, "Do you know better, or God?" And who does greater wrong
					than he who conceals a testimony he has from God? God is not unaware of what
					you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 141
			-
				-
					That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to
					you is what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they
					used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 142
			-
				-
					The ignorant among the people will say, "What has turned them away from the
					direction of prayer they once followed?" Say, "To God belong the East and the
					West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 143
			-
				-
					Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity,
					and that the Messenger may be a witness to you. We only established the
					direction of prayer, which you once followed, that We may distinguish those who
					follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. It is indeed
					difficult, except for those whom God has guided. But God would never let your
					faith go to waste. God is Kind towards the people, Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 144
			-
				-
					We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a
					direction that will satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque.
					And wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the
					Book know that it is the Truth from their Lord; and God is not unaware of what
					they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 145
			-
				-
					Even if you were to bring to those who were given the Book every proof, they
					would not follow your direction, nor are you to follow their direction, nor do
					they follow the direction of one another. And if you were to follow their
					desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would be in that case
					one of the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 146
			-
				-
					Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own
					children. But some of them conceal the truth while they know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 147
			-
				-
					The truth is from your Lord, so do not be a skeptic.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 148
			-
				-
					To every community is a direction towards which it turns. Therefore, race
					towards goodness. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together. God is
					capable of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 149
			-
				-
					And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is
					the truth from your Lord, and God is not heedless of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 150
			-
				-
					And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And
					wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. So that the people may not
					have any argument against you-except those who do wrong among them. So do not
					fear them, but fear Me, that I may complete My blessings upon you, and that you
					may be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 151
			-
				-
					Just as We sent to you a messenger from among you, who recites Our revelations
					to you, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you
					what you did not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 152
			-
				-
					So remember Me, and I will remember you. And thank Me, and do not be
					ungrateful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 153
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Seek help through patience and prayers. God is with the
					steadfast.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 154
			-
				-
					And do not say of those who are killed in the cause of God, "Dead." Rather,
					they are alive, but you do not perceive.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 155
			-
				-
					We will certainly test you with some fear and hunger, and some loss of
					possessions and lives and crops. But give good news to the steadfast.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 156
			-
				-
					Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, say, "To God we belong, and to Him we

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 157
			-
				-
					Upon these are blessings and mercy from their Lord. These are the guided ones.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 158
			-
				-
					Safa and Marwa are among the rites of God. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the
					House, or performs the Umrah, commits no error by circulating between them.
					Whoever volunteers good-God is Appreciative and Cognizant.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 159
			-
				-
					Those who suppress the proofs and the guidance We have revealed, after We have
					clarified them to humanity in the Scripture-those-God curses them, and the
					cursers curse them.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 160
			-
				-
					Except those who repent, and reform, and proclaim. Those-I will accept their
					repentance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 161
			-
				-
					But as for those who reject faith, and die rejecting-those-upon them is the
					curse of God, and of the angels, and of all humanity.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 162
			-
				-
					They will remain under it forever, and the torment will not be lightened for
					them, and they will not be reprieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 163
			-
				-
					Your God is one God. There is no god but He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 164
			-
				-
					In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and
					day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; in the water
					that God sends down from the sky, and revives the earth with it after it had
					died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds,
					and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who
					understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 165
			-
				-
					Yet among the people are those who take other than God as equals to Him. They
					love them as the love of God. But those who believe have greater love for God.
					If only the wrongdoers would realize, when they see the torment; that all power
					is God's, and that God is severe in punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 166
			-
				-
					Those who were followed will then disown those who followed them, and they will
					see the retribution, and ties between them will be severed.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 167
			-
				-
					Those who followed will say, "If only we can have another chance, we will
					disown them, as they disowned us." Thus God will show them their deeds, as
					regrets to them, and they will not come out of the Fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 168
			-
				-
					O people! Eat of what is lawful and good on earth, and do not follow the
					footsteps of Satan. He is to you an open enemy.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 169
			-
				-
					He commands you to do evil and vice, and to say about God what you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 170
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Follow what God has revealed," they say, "We will
					follow what we found our ancestors following." Even if their ancestors
					understood nothing, and were not guided?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 171
			-
				-
					The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls upon someone
					who hears nothing except screaming and yelling. Deaf, dumb, and blind-they do
					not understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 172
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 173
			-
				-
					He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what was

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 174
			-
				-
					Those who conceal what God revealed in the Book, and exchange it for a small

					to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have
					a painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 175
			-
				-
					It is they who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for punishment. But
					why do they insist on the Fire?
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 176
			-
				-
					That is because God has revealed the Book in truth; and those who differ about
					the Book are in deep discord.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 177
			-
				-
					Righteousness does not consist of turning your faces towards the East and the
					West. But righteous is he who believes in God, and the Last Day, and the
					angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets. Who gives money, though dear, to
					near relatives, and orphans, and the needy, and the homeless, and the beggars,
					and for the freeing of slaves; those who perform the prayers, and pay the
					obligatory charity, and fulfill their promise when they promise, and patiently
					persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and in the time of conflict.
					These are the sincere; these are the pious.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 178
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Retaliation for the murdered is ordained upon you: the free
					for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. But if he is
					forgiven by his kin, then grant any reasonable demand, and pay with good will.
					This is a concession from your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever commits
					aggression after that, a painful torment awaits him.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 179
			-
				-
					There is life for you in retaliation, O people of understanding, so that you

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 180
			-
				-
					It is decreed for you: when death approaches one of you, and he leaves wealth,

					correctly-a duty upon the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 181
			-
				-
					But whoever changes it after he has heard it, the guilt is upon those who
					change it. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 182
			-
				-
					Should someone suspect bias or injustice on the part of a testator, and then

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 183
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for
					those before you, that you may become righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 184
			-
				-
					For a specified number of days. But whoever among you is sick, or on a journey,
					then a number of other days. For those who are able: a ransom of feeding a
					needy person. But whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for him. But to
					fast is best for you, if you only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 185
			-
				-
					Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed. Guidance for humanity,
					and clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. Whoever of you witnesses the
					month, shall fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey, then a number of
					other days. God desires ease for you, and does not desire hardship for you,
					that you may complete the number, and celebrate God for having guided you, so
					that you may be thankful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 186
			-
				-
					And when My servants ask you about Me, I Am near; I answer the call of the

					they may be rightly guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 187
			-
				-
					Permitted for you is intercourse with your wives on the night of the fast. They
					are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them. God knows that you used
					to betray yourselves, but He turned to you and pardoned you. So approach them
					now, and seek what God has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white
					streak of dawn can be distinguished from the black streak. Then complete the
					fast until nightfall. But do not approach them while you are in retreat at the
					mosques. These are the limits of God, so do not come near them. God thus
					clarifies His revelations to the people, that they may attain piety.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 188
			-
				-
					And do not consume one another's wealth by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes

					while you know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 189
			-
				-
					They ask you about the crescents. Say, "They are timetables for people, and for
					the Hajj." It is not virtuous that you approach homes from their backs, but
					virtue is to be pious. So approach homes from their doors, and observe God,
					that you may succeed.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 190
			-
				-
					And fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not commit

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 191
			-
				-
					And kill them wherever you overtake them, and expel them from where they had
					expelled you. Oppression is more serious than murder. But do not fight them at
					the Sacred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If they fight you, then kill
					them. Such is the retribution of the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 192

				-
					But if they cease, then God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-

				-
					And fight them until there is no oppression, and worship becomes devoted to God

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 194
			-
				-
					The sacred month for the sacred month; and sacrilege calls for retaliation.

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 195
			-

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 196
			-
				-
					And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for God. But if you are prevented, then
					whatever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave your heads until the
					offering has reached its destination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an injury
					of the head, then redemption of fasting, or charity, or worship. When you are
					secure: whoever continues the Umrah until the Hajj, then whatever is feasible
					of offering. But if he lacks the means, then fasting for three days during the
					Hajj and seven when you have returned, making ten in all. This is for he whose
					household is not present at the Sacred Mosque. And remain conscious of God, and
					know that God is stern in retribution.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 197
			-
				-
					The Hajj is during specific months. Whoever decides to perform the Hajj-there
					shall be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor quarrelling during the Hajj.
					And whatever good you do, God knows it. And take provisions, but the best
					provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O people of understanding.

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 198
			-
				-
					You commit no error by seeking bounty from your Lord. When you disperse from

					you. Although, before that, you were of those astray.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 199

					Then disperse from where the people disperse, and ask God for forgiveness. God

			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 200
			-
				-
					When you have completed your rites, remember God as you remember your parents,

					world," yet he has no share in the Hereafter.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 201

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 204
			-
				-
					Among the people is he whose speech about the worldly life impresses you, and

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 205

					When he gains power, he strives to spread corruption on earth, destroying

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 206

					And when he is told, "Beware of God," his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 207

					Are they waiting for God Himself to come to them in the shadows of the clouds,

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 211

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 212
			-
				-
					Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 213
			-
				-
					Humanity used to be one community; then God sent the prophets, bringing good
					news and giving warnings. And He sent down with them the Scripture, with the
					truth, to judge between people regarding their differences. But none differed
					over it except those who were given it-after the proofs had come to them-out of
					mutual envy between them. Then God guided those who believed to the truth they
					had disputed, in accordance with His will. God guides whom He wills to a
					straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 214
			-
				-
					Or do you expect to enter Paradise before the example of those who came before

					so shaken up, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, "When is
					God's victory?" Indeed, God's victory is near.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 215
			-
				-
					They ask you what they should give. Say, "Whatever charity you give is for the

					Whatever good you do, God is aware of it.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 216
			-
				-
					Fighting is ordained for you, even though you dislike it. But it may be that

					something while it is bad for you. God knows, and you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 217
			-
				-
					They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month. Say, "Fighting during it is
					deplorable; but to bar others from God's path, and to disbelieve in Him, and to
					prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people from it, are more
					deplorable with God. And persecution is more serious than killing. They will
					not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion, if they
					can. Whoever among you turns back from his religion, and dies a
					disbeliever-those are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life, and
					in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates of the Fire, abiding in it forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 218
			-
				-
					Those who believed, and those who migrated and fought for the sake of God-those

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 219
			-
				-
					They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, "There is gross sin in them,
					and some benefits for people, but their sinfulness outweighs their benefit."
					And they ask you about what they should give: say, "The surplus." Thus God
					explains the revelations to you, so that you may think.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 220
			-
				-
					About this world and the next. And they ask you about orphans. Say,
					"Improvement for them is best. And if you intermix with them, then they are
					your brethren." God knows the dishonest from the honest. Had God willed, He
					could have overburdened you. God is Mighty and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 221
			-
				-
					Do not marry idolatresses, unless they have believed. A believing maid is
					better than an idolatress, even if you like her. And do not marry idolaters,
					unless they have believed. A believing servant is better than an idolater, even
					if you like him. These call to the Fire, but God calls to the Garden and to
					forgiveness, by His leave. He makes clear His communications to the people,
					that they may be mindful.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 222
			-
				-
					And they ask you about menstruation: say, "It is harmful, so keep away from
					women during menstruation. And do not approach them until they have become
					pure. Once they have become pure, approach them in the way God has directed
					you." God loves the repentant, and He loves those who keep clean."
				-

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 223
			-
				-
					Your women are cultivation for you; so approach your cultivation whenever you

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 224

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 226

				-
					Those who vow abstinence from their wives must wait for four months. But if

			-
				-
					And if they resolve to divorce-God is Hearing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 228
			-
				-
					Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods. And it is not lawful
					for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God
					and the Last Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have the better right to take them
					back, if they desire reconciliation. And women have rights similar to their
					obligations, according to what is fair. But men have a degree over them. God is
					Mighty and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 229
			-
				-
					Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either honorable retention, or setting free
					kindly. It is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given them,
					unless they fear that they cannot maintain God's limits. If you fear that they
					cannot maintain God's limits, then there is no blame on them if she sacrifices
					something for her release. These are God's limits, so do not transgress them.
					Those who transgress God's limits are the unjust.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 230
			-
				-
					If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful for him again until she has married
					another husband. If the latter divorces her, then there is no blame on them for
					reuniting, provided they think they can maintain God's limits. These are God's
					limits; He makes them clear to people who know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 231
			-
				-
					When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, either retain them
					amicably, or release them amicably. But do not retain them to hurt them and
					commit aggression. Whoever does that has wronged himself. And do not take God's
					revelations for a joke. And remember God's favor to you, and that He revealed
					to you the Scripture and Wisdom to teach you. And fear God, and know that God
					is aware of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 232
			-
				-
					When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, do not prevent them
					from marrying their husbands, provided they agree on fair terms. Thereby is
					advised whoever among you believes in God and the Last Day. That is better and
					more decent for you. God knows, and you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 233
			-
				-
					Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to
					complete the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father to provide for them
					and clothe them in a proper manner. No soul shall be burdened beyond its
					capacity. No mother shall be harmed on account of her child, and no father
					shall be harmed on account of his child. The same duty rests upon the heir. If
					the couple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no
					error by doing so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-mothers, as long as
					you pay them fairly. And be wary of God, and know that God is Seeing of what
					you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 234
			-
				-
					As for those among you who die and leave widows behind, their widows shall wait
					by themselves for four months and ten days. When they have reached their term,
					there is no blame on you regarding what they might honorably do with
					themselves. God is fully acquainted with what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 235
			-
				-
					You commit no error by announcing your engagement to women, or by keeping it to
					yourselves. God knows that you will be thinking about them. But do not meet
					them secretly, unless you have something proper to say. And do not confirm the
					marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled. And know that God knows what is in
					your souls, so beware of Him. And know that God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 236
			-
				-
					You commit no error by divorcing women before having touched them, or before
					having set the dowry for them. And compensate them-the wealthy according to his
					means, and the poor according to his means-with a fair compensation, a duty
					upon the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 237
			-
				-
					If you divorce them before you have touched them, but after you had set the
					dowry for them, give them half of what you specified-unless they forego the
					right, or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. But to
					forego is nearer to piety. And do not forget generosity between one another.
					God is seeing of everything you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 238
			-
				-
					Guard your prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand before God in devotion.

					But if you are in fear, then on foot, or riding. And when you are safe,

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 240
			-
				-
					Those of you who die and leave wives behind-a will shall provide their wives

					to blame for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. God is
					Mighty and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 241
			-
				-
					And divorced women shall be provided for, equitably-a duty upon the righteous.

			-
				-
					God thus explains His revelations to you, so that you may understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 243
			-
				-
					Have you not considered those who fled their homes, by the thousands, fearful
					of death? God said to them, "Die." Then He revived them. God is Gracious
					towards the people, but most people are not appreciative.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 244
			-
				-
					Fight in the cause of God, and know that God is Hearing and Knowing.

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 245
			-
				-
					Who is he who will offer God a generous loan, so He will multiply it for him

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 246
			-
				-
					Have you not considered the notables of the Children of Israel after Moses?
					When they said to a prophet of theirs, "Appoint a king for us, and we will
					fight in the cause of God." He said, "Is it possible that, if fighting was
					ordained for you, you would not fight?" They said, "Why would we not fight in
					the cause of God, when we were driven out of our homes, along with our
					children?" But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned away, except
					for a few of them. But God is aware of the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 247
			-
				-
					Their prophet said to them, "God has appointed Saul to be your king." They
					said, "How can he have authority over us, when we are more worthy of authority
					than he, and he was not given plenty of wealth?" He said, "God has chosen him
					over you, and has increased him in knowledge and stature." God bestows His
					sovereignty upon whomever He wills. God is Embracing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 248
			-
				-
					And their prophet said to them, "The proof of his kingship is that the Ark will
					be restored to you, bringing tranquility from your Lord, and relics left by the
					family of Moses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried by the angels. In
					that is a sign for you, if you are believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 249
			-
				-
					When Saul set out with the troops, he said, "God will be testing you with a
					river. Whoever drinks from it does not belong with me. But whoever does not
					drink from it, does belong with me, except for whoever scoops up a little with
					his hand." But they drank from it, except for a few of them. Then, when he
					crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, "We have no strength
					to face Goliath and his troops today." But those who knew that they would meet
					God said, "How many a small group has defeated a large group by God's will. God
					is with the steadfast."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 250
			-
				-
					And when they confronted Goliath and his troops, they said, "Our Lord, pour
					down patience on us, and strengthen our foothold, and support us against the
					faithless people."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 251
			-
				-
					And they defeated them by God's leave, and David killed Goliath, and God gave
					him sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. Were it not for God
					restraining the people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to
					ruin. But God is gracious towards mankind.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 252
			-
				-
					These are God's revelations, which We recite to you in truth. You are one of
					the messengers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 253
			-
				-
					These messengers: We gave some advantage over others. To some of them God spoke
					directly, and some He raised in rank. We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear
					miracles, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had God willed, those
					who succeeded them would not have fought one another, after the clear signs had
					come to them; but they disputed; some of them believed, and some of them
					disbelieved. Had God willed, they would not have fought one another; but God
					does whatever He desires.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 254
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Spend from what We have given you, before a Day comes in
					which there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor intercession. The
					disbelievers are the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 255
			-
				-
					God! There is no god except He, the Living, the Everlasting. Neither slumber
					overtakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and
					everything on earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His
					permission? He knows what is before them, and what is behind them; and they
					cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as He wills. His Throne extends over
					the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is
					the Most High, the Great.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 256
			-
				-
					There shall be no compulsion in religion; the right way has become distinct
					from the wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and believes in God has grasped the
					most trustworthy handle; which does not break. God is Hearing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 257
			-
				-
					God is the Lord of those who believe; He brings them out of darkness and into

					them out of light and into darkness-these are the inmates of the Fire, in which
					they will abide forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 258
			-
				-
					Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord, because God
					had given him sovereignty? Abraham said, "My Lord is He who gives life and
					causes death." He said, "I give life and cause death." Abraham said, "God
					brings the sun from the East, so bring it from the West," so the blasphemer was
					confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoing people.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 259
			-
				-
					Or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations. He said, "How
					can God revive this after its demise?" Thereupon God caused him to die for a
					hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, "For how long have you
					tarried?" He said, "I have tarried for a day, or part of a day." He said, "No.
					You have tarried for a hundred years. Now look at your food and your drink-it
					has not spoiled-and look at your donkey. We will make you a wonder for mankind.
					And look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then clothe them with flesh."
					So when it became clear to him, he said, "I know that God has power over all
					things."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 260
			-
				-
					And when Abraham said, "My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead." He
					said, "Have you not believed?" He said, "Yes, but to put my heart at ease." He
					said, "Take four birds, and incline them to yourself, then place a part on each
					hill, then call to them; and they will come rushing to you. And know that God
					is Powerful and Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 261
			-
				-
					The parable of those who spend their wealth in God's way is that of a grain
					that produces seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. God multiplies
					for whom He wills. God is Bounteous and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 262
			-
				-
					Those who spend their wealth in the way of God, and then do not follow up what
					they spent with reminders of their generosity or with insults, will have their
					reward with their Lord-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 263
			-
				-
					Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by insults. God is
					Rich and Clement.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 264
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not nullify your charitable deeds with reminders and
					hurtful words, like him who spends his wealth to be seen by the people, and
					does not believe in God and the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock
					covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bare-they gain nothing
					from their efforts. God does not guide the disbelieving people.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 265
			-
				-
					And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking God's approval, and to
					strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on a hillside. If heavy rain falls
					on it, its produce is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough.
					God is seeing of everything you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 266
			-
				-
					Would anyone of you like to have a garden of palms and vines, under which
					rivers flow-with all kinds of fruit in it for him, and old age has stricken
					him, and he has weak children-then a tornado with fire batters it, and it burns
					down? Thus God makes clear the signs for you, so that you may reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 267
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Give of the good things you have earned, and from what We

					give away, when you yourselves would not accept it except with eyes closed. And
					know that God is Sufficient and Praiseworthy.
				-

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 268

					He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. Whoever is given wisdom has been given

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 270
			-
				-
					Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you fulfill, God knows it. The

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 271
			-
				-
					If you give charity openly, that is good. But if you keep it secret, and give

					your misdeeds. God is cognizant of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 272
			-
				-
					Their guidance is not your responsibility, but God guides whom He wills. Any

					not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 273
			-
				-
					It is for the poor; those who are restrained in the way of God, and unable to
					travel in the land. The unaware would think them rich, due to their dignity.
					You will recognize them by their features. They do not ask from people
					insistently. Whatever charity you give, God is aware of it.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 274
			-
				-
					Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately and publicly, will

					grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 275
			-
				-
					Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's
					touch. That is because they say, "Commerce is like usury." But God has
					permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving advice from
					his Lord, refrains, may keep his past earnings, and his case rests with God.
					But whoever resumes-these are the dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide
					forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 276

					God condemns usury, and He blesses charities. God does not love any sinful

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 277
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and do good deeds, and pray regularly, and give charity-they

					O you who believe! Fear God, and forgo what remains of usury, if you are

					If you do not, then take notice of a war by God and His Messenger. But if you

				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 280

					But if he is in hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to remit it

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 282
			-
				-
					O you who believe! When you incur debt among yourselves for a certain period of
					time, write it down. And have a scribe write in your presence, in all fairness.
					And let no scribe refuse to write, as God has taught him. So let him write, and
					let the debtor dictate. And let him fear God, his Lord, and diminish nothing
					from it. But if the debtor is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to
					dictate, then let his guardian dictate with honesty. And call to witness two
					men from among you. If two men are not available, then one man and two women
					whose testimony is acceptable to all-if one of them fails to remember, the
					other would remind her. Witnesses must not refuse when called upon. And do not
					think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, including the time
					of repayment. That is more equitable with God, and stronger as evidence, and
					more likely to prevent doubt-except in the case of a spot transaction between
					you-then there is no blame on you if you do not write it down. And let there be
					witnesses whenever you conclude a contract, and let no harm be done to either
					scribe or witness. If you do that, it is corruption on your part. And fear God.
					God teaches you. God is aware of everything.

				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 283
			-
				-
					If you are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit
					should be handed over. But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill
					his trust, and let him fear God, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony.
					Whoever conceals it is sinner at heart. God is aware of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 284
			-
				-
					To God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Whether you reveal what
					is within your selves, or conceal it, God will call you to account for it. He
					forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. God is Able to do all
					things.
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 285
			-
				-
					The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, as did
					the believers. They all have believed in God, and His angels, and His
					scriptures, and His messengers: "We make no distinction between any of His
					messengers." And they say, "We hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our Lord. To
					you is the destiny."
				-
			-
				Surah 2 - The Cow: Ayah 286
			-
				-
					God does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. To its credit is what it
					earns, and against it is what it commits. "Our Lord, do not condemn us if we
					forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have burdened those
					before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with more than we have strength to bear;
					and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and
					Master, so help us against the disbelieving people."

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are definitive; they
					are the foundation of the Book, and others are unspecific. As for those in
					whose hearts is deviation, they follow the unspecific part, seeking dissent,
					and seeking to derive an interpretation. But none knows its interpretation
					except God and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, "We believe in it; all is
					from our Lord." But none recollects except those with understanding.

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					Like the behavior of Pharaoh's people and those before them. They rejected Our

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					There was a sign for you in the two parties that met. One party fighting in the

					is a lesson for those with insight.
				-

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Adorned for the people is the love of desires, such as women, and children, and

			-
				-
					Say, "Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who are

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Religion with God is Islam. Those to whom the Scripture was given differed only

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					If they argue with you, say, "I have surrendered myself to God, and those who

					guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is to convey. God is Seeing of
					the servants.

					Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Scripture, as they

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					That is because they said, "The Fire will not touch us except for a limited

					Believers are not to take disbelievers for friends instead of believers.

					Her Lord accepted her with a gracious reception, and brought her a beautiful

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					Whoever forges lies about God after that-these are the unjust.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					Say, "God has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham the
					Monotheist; he was not a Pagan."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					The first house established for mankind is the one at Bekka; blessed, and
					guidance for all people.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					In it are evident signs; the Station of Abraham. Whoever enters it attains
					security. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to God for all who can make the
					journey. But as for those who refuse-God is Independent of the worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					Say, "People of the Scripture, why do you reject the Revelations of God, when
					God witnesses what you do?"
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Say, "People of the Scripture, why do you hinder from God's path those who
					believe, seeking to distort it, even though you are witnesses? God is not
					unaware of what you do."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					O you who believe! If you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture,
					they will turn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					And how could you disbelieve, when God's revelations are being recited to you,
					and among you is His Messenger? Whoever cleaves to God has been guided to a
					straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Revere God with due reverence, and do not die except as
					Muslims.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					And hold fast to the rope of God, altogether, and do not become divided. And
					remember God's blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your
					hearts, and by His grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a
					pit of fire, and He saved you from it. God thus clarifies His revelations for
					you, so that you may be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					And let there be among you a community calling to virtue, and advocating
					righteousness, and deterring from evil. These are the successful.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					And do not be like those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs came
					to them; for them is a great punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened.
					As for those whose faces are blackened: "Did you disbelieve after your belief?"
					Then taste the punishment for having disbelieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					But as for those whose faces are whitened: they are in God's mercy, remaining
					in it forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					These are the revelations of God. We recite them to you in truth. God desires
					no injustice for mankind.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					To God belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth, and to God
					all events are referred.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					You are the best community that ever emerged for humanity: you advocate what is
					moral, and forbid what is immoral, and believe in God. Had the People of the
					Scripture believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are the
					believers, but most of them are sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					They will do you no harm, beyond insulting you. And if they fight you, they
					will turn around and flee, then they will not be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					They shall be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through a rope
					from God, and a rope from the people; and they incurred wrath from God, and
					were stricken with misery. That is because they rejected God's revelations, and
					killed the prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and committed
					aggression.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					They are not alike. Among the People of the Scripture is a community that is
					upright; they recite God's revelations throughout the night, and they prostrate
					themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					They believe in God and the Last Day, and advocate righteousness and forbid
					evil, and are quick to do good deeds. These are among the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					Whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. God knows the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					As for those who disbelieve, neither their possessions nor their children will
					avail them anything against God. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding
					therein forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a frosty wind
					that strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged their souls, and destroys
					it. God did not wrong them, but they wronged their own selves.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not befriend outsiders who never cease to wish you harm.
					They love to see you suffer. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but
					what their hearts conceal is worse. We have made the messages clear for you, if
					you understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					There you are, you love them, but they do not love you, and you believe in the
					entire scripture. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe;" but when they
					are alone, they bite their fingers in rage at you. Say, "Die in your rage; God
					knows what is within the hearts."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					If something good happens to you, it upsets them; but if something bad befalls
					you, they rejoice at it. But if you persevere and maintain righteousness, their
					schemes will not harm you at all. God comprehends what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					Remember when you left your home in the morning, to assign battle-positions for
					the believers. God is Hearing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					When two groups among you almost faltered, but God was their Protector. So in
					God let the believers put their trust.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					God had given you victory at Badr, when you were weak. So fear God, that you
					may be thankful.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord has
					reinforced you with three thousand angels, sent down?"
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					It is; but if you persevere and remain cautious, and they attack you suddenly,
					your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels, well trained.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					God made it but a message of hope for you, and to reassure your hearts thereby.
					Victory comes only from God the Almighty, the Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					He thus cuts off a section of those who disbelieved, or subdues them, so they
					retreat disappointed.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					It is no concern of yours whether He redeems them or punishes them. They are
					wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 129
			-
				-
					To God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He
					wills, and He punishes whom He wills. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 130
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, compounded over and over, and fear
					God, so that you may prosper.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 131
			-
				-
					And guard yourselves against the Fire that is prepared for the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 132
			-
				-
					And obey God and the Messenger, that you may obtain mercy.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 133
			-
				-
					And race towards forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden as wide as the
					heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 134
			-
				-
					Those who give in prosperity and adversity, and those who restrain anger, and
					those who forgive people. God loves the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 135
			-
				-
					And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember God
					and ask forgiveness for their sins-and who forgives sins except God? And they
					do not persist in their wrongdoing while they know.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 136
			-
				-
					Those-their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which
					rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of the
					workers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 137
			-
				-
					Many societies have passed away before you. So travel the earth and note the
					fate of the deniers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 138
			-
				-
					This is a proclamation to humanity, and guidance, and advice for the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 139
			-
				-
					And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You are the superior ones, if you are
					believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 140
			-
				-
					If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound has afflicted the others. Such days We
					alternate between the people, that God may know those who believe, and take
					martyrs from among you. God does not love the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 141
			-
				-
					So that God may prove those who believe, and eliminate the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 142
			-
				-
					Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before God has distinguished those among
					you who strive, and before He has distinguished the steadfast?
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 143
			-
				-
					You used to wish for death before you have faced it. Now you have seen it
					before your own eyes.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 144
			-
				-
					Muhammad is no more than a messenger. Messengers have passed on before him. If
					he dies or gets killed, will you turn on your heels? He who turns on his heels
					will not harm God in any way. And God will reward the appreciative.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 145
			-
				-
					No soul can die except by God's leave, at a predetermined time. Whoever desires
					the reward of the world, We will give him some of it; and whoever desires the
					reward of the Hereafter, We will give him some of it; and We will reward the
					appreciative.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 146
			-
				-
					How many a prophet fought alongside him numerous godly people? They did not
					waver for what afflicted them in the cause of God, nor did they weaken, nor did
					they give in. God loves those who endure.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 147
			-
				-
					Their only words were, "Our Lord, forgive us our offences, and our excesses in
					our conduct, and strengthen our foothold, and help us against the disbelieving
					people."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 148
			-
				-
					So God gave them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the
					Hereafter. God loves the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 149
			-
				-
					O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on
					your heels, and you end up losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 150
			-
				-
					God is your Master, and He is the Best of Helpers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 151
			-
				-
					We will throw terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they
					attribute to God partners for which He revealed no sanction. Their lodging is
					the Fire. Miserable is the lodging of the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 152
			-
				-
					God has fulfilled His promise to you, and you defeated them by His leave; until
					when you faltered, and disputed the command, and disobeyed after He had shown
					you what you like. Some of you want this world, and some of you want the next.
					Then He turned you away from them, to test you; but He pardoned you. God is
					Gracious towards the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 153
			-
				-
					Remember when you fled, not caring for anyone, even though the Messenger was
					calling you from your rear. Then He repaid you with sorrow upon sorrow, so that
					you would not grieve over what you missed, or for what afflicted you. God is
					Informed of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 154
			-
				-
					Then after the setback, He sent down security upon you. Slumber overcame some
					of you, while others cared only for themselves, thinking of God thoughts that
					were untrue-thoughts of ignorance-saying, "Is anything up to us?" Say,
					"Everything is up to God." They conceal within themselves what they do not
					reveal to you. And they say, "If it was up to us, none of us would have been
					killed here." Say, "Even if you Had stayed in your homes, those destined to be
					killed would have marched into their death beds." God thus tests what is in
					your minds, and purifies what is in your hearts. God knows what the hearts
					contain.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 155
			-
				-
					Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies clashed-it was
					Satan who caused them to backslide, on account of some of what they have
					earned. But God has forgiven them. God is Forgiving and Prudent.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 156
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not be like those who disbelieved, and said of their
					brethren who marched in the land, or went on the offensive, "Had they stayed
					with us, they would not have died or been killed." So that God may make it a
					cause of regret in their hearts. God gives life and causes death. God is Seeing
					of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 157
			-
				-
					If you are killed in the cause of God, or die-forgiveness and mercy from God
					are better than what they hoard.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 158
			-
				-
					If you die, or are killed-to God you will be gathered up.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 159
			-
				-
					It is by of grace from God that you were gentle with them. Had you been harsh,
					hardhearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask
					forgiveness for them, and consult them in the conduct of affairs. And when you
					make a decision, put your trust in God; God loves the trusting.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 160
			-
				-
					If God supports you, there is none who can overcome you. But if He fails you,
					who is there to help you after Him? So in God let the believers put their
					trust.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 161
			-
				-
					It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. Whoever acts dishonestly will bring
					his dishonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full
					for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 162
			-
				-
					Is someone who pursues God's approval the same as someone who incurs God's
					wrath and his refuge is Hell-the miserable destination?
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 163
			-
				-
					They have different ranks with God, and God is Seeing of what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 164
			-
				-
					God has blessed the believers, as He raised up among them a messenger from
					among themselves, who recites to them His revelations, and purifies them, and
					teaches them the Scripture and wisdom; although before that they were in
					evident error.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 165
			-
				-
					And when a calamity befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you
					said, "How is this?" Say, "It is from your own selves." God is Able to do all
					things.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 166
			-
				-
					What befell you on the day the two armies clashed was with God's permission;
					that He may know the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 167
			-
				-
					And that He may know the hypocrites. And it was said to them, "Come, fight in
					the cause of God, or contribute." They said, "If we knew how to fight, we would
					have followed you." On that day they were closer to infidelity than they were
					to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts; but God knows
					what they hide.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 168
			-
				-
					Those who said of their brethren, as they stayed behind, "Had they obeyed us,
					they would not have been killed." Say, "Then avert death from yourselves, if
					you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 169
			-
				-
					Do not consider those killed in the cause of God as dead. In fact, they are
					alive, at their Lord, well provided for.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 170
			-
				-
					Delighting in what God has given them out of His grace, and happy for those who
					have not yet joined them; that they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 171
			-
				-
					They rejoice in grace from God, and bounty, and that God will not waste the
					reward of the faithful.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 172
			-
				-
					Those who responded to God and the Messenger, despite the persecution they had
					suffered. For the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 173
			-
				-
					Those to whom the people have said, "The people have mobilized against you, so
					fear them." But this only increased them in faith, and they said, "God is
					enough for us; He is the Excellent Protector."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 174
			-
				-
					So they came back with grace from God, and bounty, and no harm having touched
					them. They pursued what pleases God. God possesses immense grace.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 175
			-
				-
					That is only Satan frightening his partisans; so do not fear them, but fear Me,
					if you are believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 176
			-
				-
					And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God
					in the least. God desires to give them no share in the Hereafter. A terrible
					torment awaits them.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 177
			-
				-
					Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm God in the least. A
					painful torment awaits them.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 178
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good.
					In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A
					humiliating torment awaits them.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 179
			-
				-
					God will not leave the believers as you are, without distinguishing the wicked
					from the sincere. Nor will God inform you of the future, but God elects from
					among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His messengers. If
					you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 180
			-
				-
					Those who withhold what God has given them of his bounty should not assume that
					is good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their
					hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To God belongs the inheritance of the
					heavens and the earth, and God is well acquainted with what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 181
			-
				-
					God has heard the statement of those who said, "God is poor, and we are rich."
					We will write down what they said, and their wrongful killing of the prophets;
					and We will say, "Taste the torment of the burning."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 182
			-
				-
					"This is on account of what your hands have forwarded, and because God is not
					unjust towards the creatures."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 183
			-
				-
					Those who said, "God has made a covenant with us, that we shall not believe in
					any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire." Say,
					"Messengers have come to you before me with proofs, and with what you asked
					for; so why did you assassinate them, if you are truthful?"
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 184
			-
				-
					If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying. They
					came with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Scripture.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 185
			-
				-
					Every soul will have a taste of death, and you will receive your recompense on
					the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to
					Paradise, has won. The life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 186
			-
				-
					You will be tested through your possessions and your persons; and you will hear
					from those who received the Scripture before you, and from the idol worshipers,
					much abuse. But if you persevere and lead a righteous life-that indeed is a
					mark of great determination.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 187
			-
				-
					God received a pledge from those who were given the Scripture: "You shall
					proclaim it to the people, and not conceal it." But they disregarded it behind
					their backs, and exchanged it for a small price. What a miserable exchange they
					made.
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 188
			-
				-
					Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be
					praised for what they have not done-do not think they can evade the punishment.
					They will have a painful punishment.
				-

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 189

					To God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God has power over

					In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 191
			-
				-
					Those who remember God while standing, and sitting, and on their sides; and

					Fire."
				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 192

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 193
			-
				-
					"Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,'

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 194

				-
			-
				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 195
			-
				-
					And so their Lord answered them: "I will not waste the work of any worker among
					you, whether male or female. You are one of another. For those who emigrated,
					and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and
					fought and were killed-I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them
					into gardens beneath which rivers flow-a reward from God. With God is the
					ultimate reward."

				Surah 3 - The Family of Imran: Ayah 199
			-
				-
					Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in God, and in what was

					And give orphans their properties, and do not substitute the bad for the good.

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the orphans-then marry the women you

			-
				-
					Test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. If you find them to be

				-
					God instructs you regarding your children: The male receives the equivalent of
					the share of two females. If they are daughters, more than two, they get
					two-thirds of what he leaves. If there is only one, she gets one-half. As for
					the parents, each gets one-sixth of what he leaves, if he had children. If he
					had no children, and his parents inherit from him, his mother gets one-third.
					If he has siblings, his mother gets one-sixth. After fulfilling any bequest and

					closer to you in welfare. This is God's Law. God is Knowing and Judicious.

					You get one-half of what your wives leave behind, if they had no children. If

					you have no children. If you have children, they get one-eighth of what you
					leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts. If a man or woman
					leaves neither parents nor children, but has a brother or sister, each of them
					gets one-sixth. If there are more siblings, they share one-third. After
					fulfilling any bequest and paying off debts, without any prejudice. This is a
					will from God. God is Knowing and Clement.

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					But repentance is not available for those who commit evils, until when death

				-
					O you who believe! It is not permitted for you to inherit women against their

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 20

					If you wish to replace one wife with another, and you have given one of them a

				-
			-

				-
					And how can you take it back, when you have been intimate with one another, and

					Do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what is already past. That

					Forbidden for you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal

					mothers, and your stepdaughters in your guardianship-born of wives you have
					gone into-but if you have not gone into them, there is no blame on you. And the
					wives of your genetic sons, and marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except
					what is past. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					And all married women, except those you rightfully possess. This is God's
					decree, binding upon you. Permitted for you are those that lie outside these
					limits, provided you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts from your
					property, seeking wedlock, not prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then
					give them their dowry-a legal obligation. You commit no error by agreeing to
					any change to the dowry. God is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					If any of you lack the means to marry free believing women, he may marry one of
					the believing maids under your control. God is well aware of your faith. You
					are from one another. Marry them with the permission of their guardians, and
					give them their recompense fairly-to be protected-neither committing adultery,
					nor taking secret lovers. When they are married, if they commit adultery, their
					punishment shall be half that of free women. That is for those among you who
					fear falling into decadence. But to practice self-restraint is better for you.
					God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.

					Do not covet what God has given to some of you in preference to others. For men

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 33

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, as God has given some of them
					an advantage over others, and because they spend out of their wealth. The good
					women are obedient, guarding what God would have them guard. As for those from
					whom you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, then
					strike them. But if they obey you, seek no way against them. God is Sublime,
					Great.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 35
			-

					If you fear a breach between the two, appoint an arbiter from his family and an

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Worship God, and ascribe no partners to Him, and be good to the parents, and

					the distant neighbor, and the close associate, and the traveler, and your
					servants. God does not love the arrogant showoff.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Those who are stingy, and exhort people to stinginess, and conceal what God has

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And those who spend their money to be seen by people, and believe neither in

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					What would they have lost, had they believed in God and the Last Day, and gave

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 40
			-

					Then how will it be, when We bring a witness from every community, and We bring

					On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer while you are drunk, so that you

					have bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the
					toilet, or you have had intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find
					clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God is Pardoning and
					Forgiving.
				-

					Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They buy

					But God knows your enemies best. God is sufficient as a Protector, and God is

			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Among the Jews are some who take words out of context, and say, "We hear and we

					tongues and slandering the religion. Had they said, "We hear and we obey", and
					"Listen", and "Give us your attention," it would have been better for them, and
					more upright. But God has cursed them for their disbelief; they do not believe
					except a little.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					O you who were given the Book! Believe in what We sent down, confirming what

					We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. The command of God is always done.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					God does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives anything less than

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Have you not considered those who claim purity for themselves? Rather, God
					purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged a whit.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					See how they devise lies against God. That alone is an outright sin.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They believe

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Those are they whom God has cursed. Whomever God curses, you will find no

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Or do they own a share of the kingdom? Then they would not give people a speck.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Or do they envy the people for what God has given them of His grace? We have
					given the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom, and We have given them a great
					kingdom.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 55

				-
					Among them are those who believed in it, and among them are those who held back

			-
				-
					Those who reject Our revelations-We will scorch them in a Fire. Every time

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					As for those who believe and do good deeds, We will admit them into Gardens

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					God instructs you to give back things entrusted to you to their owners. And

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Have you not observed those who claim that they believe in what was revealed to

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 61

			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 63

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by God's leave. Had they,

					and the Messenger had prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found God
					Relenting and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they call you to arbitrate in

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Had We decreed for them: "Kill yourselves," or "Leave your homes," they would

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And We would have given them from Our presence a rich compensation.

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					Among you is he who lags behind. Then, when a calamity befalls you, he says,

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					But when some bounty from God comes to you, he says-as if no affection existed

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Let those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the cause

					victory, We will grant him a great compensation.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					And why would you not fight in the cause of God, and the helpless men, and

					are oppressive, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Protector, and appoint
					for us from Your Presence a Victor."
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					Those who believe fight in the cause of God, while those who disbelieve fight
					in the cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. Surely the strategy of
					the Devil is weak.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Have you not considered those who were told, "Restrain your hands, and perform
					your prayers, and spend in regular charity"? But when fighting was ordained for
					them, a faction of them feared the people as God is ought to be feared, or even
					more. And they said, "Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting for us? If only You
					would postpone it for us for a short while." Say, "The enjoyments of this life
					are brief, but the Hereafter is better for the righteous, and you will not be
					wronged one bit."
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Wherever you may be, death will catch up with you, even if you were in
					fortified towers. When a good fortune comes their way, they say, "This is from
					God." But when a misfortune befalls them, they say, "This is from you." Say,
					"All is from God." So what is the matter with these people, that they hardly
					understand a thing?
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Whatever good happens to you is from God, and whatever bad happens to you is

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying God. And whoever turns away-We did not

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					They profess obedience, but when they leave your presence, some of them

					conspire. So avoid them, and put your trust in God. God is Guardian enough.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it been from any other than God, they would

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had
					they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those
					who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. Were it not for
					God's blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except
					for a few.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					So fight in the cause of God; you are responsible only for yourself. And rouse

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it, and whoever intercedes

				-
					When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					God-there is no god except He. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection,
					in which there is no doubt. And who speaks more truly than God?
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					What is the matter with you, divided into two factions regarding the
					hypocrites, when God Himself has overwhelmed them on account of what they did?
					Do you want to guide those whom God has led astray? Whomever God leads
					astray-you will never find for him a way.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					They would love to see you disbelieve, just as they disbelieve, so you would
					become equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless they emigrate in the way
					of God. If they turn away, seize them and execute them wherever you may find
					them; and do not take from among them allies or supporters.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Except those who join people with whom you have a treaty, or those who come to
					you reluctant to fight you or fight their own people. Had God willed, He would
					have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they
					withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then God assigns
					no excuse for you against them.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					You will find others who want security from you, and security from their own
					people. But whenever they are tempted into civil discord, they plunge into it.
					So if they do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor restrain their
					hands, seize them and execute them wherever you find them. Against these, We
					have given you clear authorization.

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Never should a believer kill another believer, unless by error. Anyone who
					kills a believer by error must set free a believing slave, and pay compensation
					to the victim's family, unless they remit it as charity. If the victim belonged
					to a people who are hostile to you, but is a believer, then the compensation is
					to free a believing slave. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a
					treaty, then compensation should be handed over to his family, and a believing
					slave set free. Anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive
					months, by way of repentance to God. God is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the penalty for him is Hell, where he

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					O you who believe! When you journey in the way of God, investigate, and do not
					say to him who offers you peace, "You are not a believer," aspiring for the
					goods of this world. With God are abundant riches. You yourselves were like
					this before, and God bestowed favor on you; so investigate. God is well aware
					of what you do.

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					Not equal are the inactive among the believers-except the disabled-and the
					strivers in the cause of God with their possessions and their persons. God
					prefers the strivers with their possessions and their persons above the
					inactive, by a degree. But God has promised goodness to both. Yet God favors
					the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward.

			-
				-
					While the angels are removing the souls of those who have wronged themselves,
					they will say, "What was the matter with you?" They will say, "We were
					oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was God's earth not vast enough for you
					to emigrate in it?" These-their refuge is Hell. What a wretched retreat!
				-

			-
				-
					Anyone who emigrates for the sake of God will find on earth many places of

					is Forgiver, Most Merciful.

			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 101

				-
					When you travel in the land, there is no blame on you for shortening the

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					When you are among them, and you stand to lead them in prayer, let a group of
					them stand with you, and let them hold their weapons. Then, when they have done
					their prostrations, let them withdraw to the rear, and let another group, that
					have not prayed yet, come forward and pray with you; and let them take their
					precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve would like you to neglect
					your weapons and your equipment, so they can attack you in a single assault.
					You commit no error, if you are hampered by rain or are sick, by putting down
					your weapons; but take precautions. Indeed, God has prepared for the
					disbelievers a demeaning punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					When you have completed the prayer, remember God, standing, or sitting, or on

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 104
			-

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					Were it not for God's grace towards you, and His mercy, a faction of them would

					taught you what you did not know. God's goodness towards you is great.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 114
			-

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					Whoever makes a breach with the Messenger, after the guidance has become clear

					destination!
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					God will not forgive that partners be associated with Him; but will forgive

					But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 123
			-

			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					If a woman fears maltreatment or desertion from her husband, there is no fault

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 129
			-

					O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even if

			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 136
			-
				-

			-
				-
					He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God's revelations being

				-

				-
					Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain victory from God, they say, "Were

				-

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 153
			-
				-
					The People of the Scripture challenge you to bring down to them a book from the

					plainly." The thunderbolt struck them for their wickedness. Then they took the
					calf for worship, even after the clear proofs had come to them. Yet We pardoned
					that, and We gave Moses a clear authority.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 154
			-

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 155
			-
				-
					But for their violation of their covenant, and their denial of God's

					not believe, except for a few.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 156
			-
				-
					And for their faithlessness, and their saying against Mary a monstrous slander.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 157
			-
				-
					And for their saying, "We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the

					but it appeared to them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ about him are
					in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it, except the following of
					assumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.
				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 158

					Rather, God raised him up to Himself. God is Mighty and Wise.

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 161

					But those among them firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believe in

					O people! The Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so

				-
			-
				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 171
			-
				-
					O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion, and do not say
					about God except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is the
					Messenger of God, and His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him.
					So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, "Three." Refrain-it is
					better for you. God is only one God. Glory be to Him-that He should have a son.
					To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and God is a sufficient
					Protector.
				-

				-

					But as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in

				Surah 4 - The Women: Ayah 176
			-
				-
					They ask you for a ruling. Say, "God gives you a ruling concerning the person

					and he had a sister, she receives one-half of what he leaves. And he inherits
					from her if she leaves no children. But if there are two sisters, they receive
					two-thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are men and women, the male
					receives the share of two females." God makes things clear for you, lest you
					err. God is Aware of everything.

					O you who believe! Be upright to God, witnessing with justice; and let not the
					hatred of a certain people prevent you from acting justly. Adhere to justice,
					for that is nearer to piety; and fear God. God is informed of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					God has promised those who believe and work righteousness: they will have
					forgiveness and a great reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 10
			-

					As for those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations-these are the inmates of

				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Remember God's blessings upon you; when certain people
					intended to extend their hands against you, and He restrained their hands from
					you. So reverence God, and in God let the believers put their trust.

			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					God received a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We raised among them
					twelve chiefs. God said, "I am with you; if you perform the prayer, and pay the
					alms, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend God a loan of
					righteousness; I will remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens beneath which
					rivers flow. But whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed from the
					right way."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Because of their breaking their pledge, We cursed them, and made their hearts
					hard. They twist the words out of their context, and they disregarded some of
					what they were reminded of. You will always witness deceit from them, except
					for a few of them. But pardon them, and overlook. God loves the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And from those who say, "We are Christians," We received their pledge, but they
					neglected some of what they were reminded of. So We provoked enmity and hatred
					among them until the Day of Resurrection; God will then inform them of what
					they used to craft.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying for you much of

					come to you, and a clear Book.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					God guides with it whoever follows His approval to the ways of peace, and He
					brings them out of darkness into light, by His permission, and He guides them

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					They disbelieve those who say, "God is the Christ, the son of Mary." Say, "Who
					can prevent God, if He willed, from annihilating the Christ son of Mary, and
					his mother, and everyone on earth?" To God belongs the sovereignty of the
					heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills,
					and God has power over everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					The Jews and the Christians say, "We are the children of God, and His beloved."
					Say, "Why then does He punish you for your sins?" In fact, you are humans from
					among those He created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He
					wills. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lies
					between them, and to Him is the return.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to
					you-after a cessation of messengers-so that you cannot say, "No preacher has
					come to us, and no warner." In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner;
					and God is Capable of everything.

				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 20
			-

					When Moses said to his people, "my people, remember God's blessings upon you,

					never gave any other people."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 21

				-

				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					They said, "Moses, there are tyrannical people in it; we will not enter it

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					Two men of those who feared, but whom God had blessed, said, "Go at them by the

					God, if you are believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 24
			-

					They said, "Moses, we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. So go

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					He said, "It is forbidden for them for forty years. They will wander aimlessly

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					And relate to them the true story of Adam's two sons: when they offered an
					offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but it was not accepted from
					the other. He Said, "I will kill you." He Said, "God accepts only from the
					righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 28

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Then His soul prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him, and became
					one of the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Then God sent a raven digging the ground, to show him how to cover his
					brother's corpse. He said, "Woe to me! I was unable to be like this raven, and
					bury my brother's corpse." So he became full of regrets.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel: that whoever kills a
					person-unless it is for murder or corruption on earth-it is as if he killed the
					whole of mankind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved the whole of
					mankind. Our messengers came to them with clarifications, but even after that,
					many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					The punishment for those who fight God and His Messenger, and strive to spread
					corruption on earth, is that they be killed, or crucified, or have their hands
					and feet cut off on opposite sides, or be banished from the land. That is to
					disgrace them in this life; and in the Hereafter they will have a terrible
					punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 34

				-
					Except for those who repent before you apprehend them. So know that God is

					O you who believe! Be conscious of God, and seek the means of approach to Him,

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the
					like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment
					of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them. For them is a
					painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					As for the thief, whether male or female, cut their hands as a penalty for what

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 39
			-

				-
					Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					O Messenger! Do not let those who are quick to disbelief grieve you-from among
					those who say with their mouths, "We believe," but their hearts do not believe;
					and from among the Jews-listeners to lies, listeners to other people who did
					not come to you. They distort words from their places, and they say, "If you
					are given this, accept it; but if you are not given it, beware." Whomever God
					has willed to divert, you have nothing for him from God. Those are they whose
					hearts God does not intend to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and
					for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit earnings. If they come to you, judge
					between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they will not
					harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between them equitably. God
					loves the equitable.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is
					God's Law? Yet they turn away after that. These are not believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light. The submissive
					prophets ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rabbis and the scholars, as
					they were required to protect God's Book, and were witnesses to it. So do not
					fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My revelations for a cheap price.
					Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the unbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a
					nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound;
					but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him. Those
					who do not rule according to what God revealed are the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, fulfilling the Torah that
					preceded him; and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and
					confirming the Torah that preceded him, and guidance and counsel for the
					righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what God revealed in it.
					Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that
					preceded it, and superseding it. So judge between them according to what God
					revealed, and do not follow their desires if they differ from the truth that
					has come to you. For each of you We have assigned a law and a method. Had God
					willed, He could have made you a single nation, but He tests you through what
					He has given you. So compete in righteousness. To God is your return, all of
					you; then He will inform you of what you had disputed.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And judge between them according to what God revealed, and do not follow their
					desires. And beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what God has
					revealed to you. But if they turn away, know that God intends to strike them
					with some of their sins. In fact, a great many people are corrupt.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than
					God in judgment for people who are certain?
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies; some of
					them are allies of one another. Whoever of you allies himself with them is one
					of them. God does not guide the wrongdoing people.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					You will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them. They say,
					"We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us." But perhaps God will bring
					about victory, or some event of His making; thereupon they will regret what
					they concealed within themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore by God with their

					became losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Whoever of you goes back on his religion-God will bring a
					people whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with
					the disbelievers. They strive in the way of God, and do not fear the blame of
					the critic. That is the grace of God; He bestows it upon whomever He wills. God
					is Embracing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Your allies are God, and His Messenger, and those who believe-those who pray
					regularly, and give charity, and bow down.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Whoever allies himself with God, and His Messenger, and those who

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not befriend those who take your religion in mockery and
					as a sport, be they from among those who were given the Scripture before you,
					or the disbelievers. And obey God, if you are believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					When you call to the prayer, they take it as a joke and a trifle. That is
					because they are people who do not reason.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Say, "People of the Scripture! Do you resent us only because we believe in God,
					and in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed previously; and most
					of you are sinners?"
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Say, "Shall I inform you of worse than that for retribution from God? He whom
					God has cursed, and with whom He became angry; and He turned some of them into
					apes, and swine, and idol worshipers. These are in a worse position, and
					further away from the right way."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					When they come to you, they say, "We believe," though they have entered with

					hide.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					You see many of them competing with one another in sin and hostility, and their
					consuming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Why do the rabbis and the priests not prevent them from speaking sinfully and
					from consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what they have been doing.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					The Jews say, "God's hand is tied." It is their hands that are tied, and they
					are cursed for what they say. In fact, His hands are outstretched; He gives as
					He wills. Certainly, what was revealed to you from your Lord will increase many
					of them in defiance and blasphemy. And We placed between them enmity and
					hatred, until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war,
					God extinguishes it. And they strive to spread corruption on earth. God does
					not love the corrupters.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Had the People of the Scriputure believed and been righteous, We would have
					remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Had they observed the Torah, and the Gospel, and what was revealed to them from
					their Lord, they would have consumed amply from above them, and from beneath

					are doing.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					O Messenger, convey what was revealed to you from your Lord. But if you do not,
					then you would not have delivered His message. And God will protect you from
					the people. God does not guide the disbelieving people.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Say, "People of the Scripture! You have no basis until you uphold the Torah,
					and the Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord." But what is
					revealed to you from your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and
					disbelief, so do not be sorry for the disbelieving people.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians-whoever

					fear, nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers.
					Whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire, some of
					them they accused of lying, and others they put to death.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					They assumed there would be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then
					God redeemed them, but then again many of them turned blind and deaf. But God
					is Seeing of what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					They disbelieve those who say, "God is the Messiah the son of Mary." But the
					Messiah himself said, "Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.
					Whoever associates others with God, God has forbidden him Paradise, and his
					dwelling is the Fire. The wrongdoers have no saviors."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					They disbelieve those who say, "God is the third of three." But there is no
					deity except the One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful
					torment will befall those among them who disbelieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Will they not repent to God and ask His forgiveness? God is Forgiving and
					Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger, before whom other Messengers had
					passed away, and his mother was a woman of truth. They both used to eat food.
					Note how We make clear the revelations to them; then note how deluded they are.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					Say, "Do you worship, besides God, what has no power to harm or benefit you?"
					But God: He is the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Say, "People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion beyond the
					truth; and do not follow the opinions of people who went astray before, and
					misled many, and themselves strayed off the balanced way."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Cursed were those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel by the
					tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That is because they rebelled and used
					to transgress.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					They used not to prevent one another from the wrongs they used to commit. Evil
					is what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Terrible is what
					their souls prompts them to do. The wrath of God fell upon them, and in the
					torment they will remain.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Had they believed in God and the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, they
					would not have befriended them. But many of them are immoral.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					You will find that the people most hostile towards the believers are the Jews
					and the polytheists. And you will find that the nearest in affection towards
					the believers are those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among
					them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					And when they hear what was revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 84

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					And eat of the lawful and good things God has provided for you; and be

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					God does not hold you accountable for your unintended oaths, but He holds you
					accountable for your binding oaths. The atonement for it is by feeding ten
					needy people from the average of what you feed your families, or by clothing
					them, or by freeing a slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three
					days. That is the atonement for breaking your oaths when you have sworn them.
					So keep your oaths. Thus God makes clear His Revelations to you, that you may
					be grateful.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 90

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 91

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Obey God and obey the Messenger, and be cautious. If you turn away-know that

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Those who believe and do righteous deeds will not be blamed for what they may
					have eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and do good deeds, then maintain
					piety and faith, then remain righteous and charitable. God loves the
					charitable.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					O you who believe! God will test you with something of the game your hands and

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					O you who believe! do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever
					of you kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a domestic animal
					comparable to what he killed, as determined by two honest persons among you-an
					offering delivered to the Kaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the needy, or its
					equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the consequences of his conduct.
					God forgives what is past. But whoever repeats, God will take revenge on him.
					God is Almighty, Avenger.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and its food-as sustenance for you and

					pilgrim sanctity. And fear God, to Whom you will be gathered.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					God has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for the people, and

					God knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and that God is Cognizant of
					all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					Know that God is severe in retribution, and that God is Forgiving and Merciful.

				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					The Messenger's sole duty is to convey. God knows what you reveal and what you

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Say: "The bad and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad

					you may succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not ask about things that would trouble you if disclosed

					they will become obvious to you. God forgives that. God is Forgiving and
					Clement.

					A people before you asked about them, but then came to reject them.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					God did not institute the superstitions of Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of
					Hami; but those who disbelieve fabricate lies about God-most of them do not
					understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Come to what God has revealed, and to the
					Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers
					upon." Even if their forefathers knew nothing, and were not guided?
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					O you who believe! You are responsible for your own souls. He who has strayed
					cannot harm you if you are guided. To God is you return, all of you, and He
					will inform you of what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					O you who believe! When death approaches one of you, let two reliable persons
					from among you act as witnesses to the making of a bequest, or two persons from
					another people if you are travelling in the land and the event of death
					approaches you. Engage them after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them
					swear by God: "We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if he was a
					near relative, and we will not conceal God's testimony, for then we would be
					sinners."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					If it is discovered that they are guilty of perjury: let two others take their
					place, two from among those responsible for the claim, and have them swear by
					God, "Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and we will not be
					biased, for then we would be wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					That makes it more likely that they will give true testimony, fearing that
					their oaths might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. So fear God, and listen.
					God does not guide the disobedient people.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					On the Day when God will gather the messengers, then say, "What response were
					you given?" They will say, "We have no knowledge; it is You Who are the Knower
					of the unseen."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					When God will say, "Jesus son of Mary, recall My favor upon you and upon your
					mother, how I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to the people from
					the crib, and in maturity. How I taught you the Scripture and wisdom, and the
					Torah and the Gospel. And recall that you molded from clay the shape of a bird,
					by My leave, and then you breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My leave.
					And you healed the blind and the leprous, by My leave; and you revived the
					dead, by My leave. And recall that I restrained the Children of Israel from you
					when you brought them the clear miracles. But those who disbelieved among them
					said, `This is nothing but obvious sorcery.'"

				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 111

			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 112

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 113
			-

				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					Jesus son of Mary said, "God, our Lord, send down for us a table from heaven,
					to be a festival for us, for the first of us, and the last of us, and a sign
					from You; and provide for us; You are the Best of providers."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					God said, "I will send it down to you. But whoever among you disbelieves
					thereafter, I will punish him with a punishment the like of which I never
					punish any other being."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					And God will say, "Jesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and
					my mother as gods rather than God?'" He will say, "Glory be to You! It is not
					for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it.
					You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in Your soul. You are
					the Knower of the hidden.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					I only told them what You commanded me: that you shall worship God, my Lord and
					your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I was among them; but when You
					took me to Yourself, You became the Watcher over them-You are Witness over
					everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					If You punish them, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them, You are
					the Mighty and Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					God will say, "This is a Day when the truthful will benefit from their
					truthfulness." They will have Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they
					will remain forever. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him.
					That is the great attainment.
				-
			-
				Surah 5 - The Table: Ayah 120

				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					Praise be to God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness
					and the light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals to their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					It is He Who created you from clay, then decided a term-a term determined by
					Him. Yet you doubt.
				-

				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 3
			-

					He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you keep secret and what

			-
				-
					Not one of their Lord's signs comes to them, but they turn away from it.
				-

				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					They denied the truth when it has come to them; but soon will reach them the

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them? We had
					established them on earth more firmly than We established you, and We sent the
					clouds pouring down abundant rain on them, and We made rivers flow beneath
					them. But We destroyed them for their sins, and established other civilizations
					after them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					Had We sent down upon you a book on paper, and they had touched it with their
					hands, those who disbelieve would have said, "This is nothing but plain magic."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					And they say, "Why was an angel not sent down to him." Had We sent down an

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 9

				-
					Had We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and confused them when

				-
					Messengers before you were ridiculed, but those who mocked them became besieged

			-
				-
					Say, "Travel the earth and observe the final fate of the deniers."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Say, "To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?" Say, "To God." He
					has inscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection,
					in which there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					To Him belongs whatever rests in the night and the day. He is the Hearing, the

			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Say, "Shall I take for myself a protector other than God, Originator of the

					be the first of those who submit." And do not be among the idolaters.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					Say, "I fear, should I defy my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day."

					Whoever is spared on that Day-He had mercy on him. That is the clear victory.

			-
				-
					Say, "What thing is more solemn in testimony?" Say, "God is Witness between you
					and me. This Quran was revealed to me, that I may warn you with it, and
					whomever it may reach. Do you indeed testify that there are other gods with

					innocent of your idolatry."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 20

					Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own

			-
				-
					Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies against God, or denies

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					On the Day when We gather them all together, then say to the idolaters, "Where
					are your idols, those you used to claim?"
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					Then their only argument will be to say, "By God, our Lord, we were not
					idolaters."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					Look how they lied to themselves. And what they invented deserted them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					Among them are those who listen to you; but We place covers over their hearts,
					to prevent them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Even if
					they see every sign, they will not believe in it. Until, when they come to you,
					to argue with you, those who disbelieve will say, "These are nothing but myths
					of the ancients."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					They keep others from it, and avoid it themselves; but they ruin only their own

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					If only you could see, when they are made to stand before the Fire; they will
					say, "If only we could be sent back, and not reject the revelations of our
					Lord, and be among the faithful."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					What they used to conceal before will become clear to them. And even if they
					were sent back, they would revert to what they were forbidden. They are liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					And they say, "There is nothing but our life in this world, and we will not be

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					If only you could see, when they are stationed before their Lord. He will say,

					"Then taste the torment for having disbelieved."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Losers are those who deny the encounter with God. Then, when the Hour comes
					upon them suddenly, they will say, "Alas for us, how we have neglected it." And
					they will carry their burdens on their backs-evil is what they carry.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					The life of this world is nothing but game and distraction, but the Home of the
					Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Do you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					We know that what they say grieves you. It is not you they reject, but it is
					God's revelations that the wicked deny.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Other messengers before you were rejected, but they endured rejection and
					persecution until Our help came to them. There can be no change to God's words.
					News of the Messengers has already reached you.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					If you find their rejection hard to bear, then if you can, seek a tunnel into
					the earth, or a stairway into the heaven, and bring them a sign. Had God
					willed, He could have gathered them to guidance. So do not be of the ignorant.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Only those who listen will respond. As for the dead, God will resurrect them;
					then to Him they will be returned.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					And they say, "If only a sign could come down to him from his Lord." Say, "God
					is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					There is no animal on land, nor a bird flying with its wings, but are
					communities like you. We neglected nothing in the Scripture. Then to their Lord
					they will be gathered.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Those who reject Our revelations are deaf and dumb, in total darkness. Whomever
					God wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He wills, He sets on a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? if God's punishment came upon you, or the Hour
					overtook you, would you call upon any other than God, if you are sincere?"
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if He wills, he will remove what you
					called Him for, and you will forget what you idolized.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					We sent messengers to communities before you, and We afflicted them with
					suffering and hardship, that they may humble themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					If only, when Our calamity came upon them, they humbled themselves. But their
					hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds appear good to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Then, when they disregarded what they were reminded of, We opened for them the
					gates of all things. Until, when they delighted in what they were given, We
					seized them suddenly; and at once, they were in despair.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Thus the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off. And praise be to
					God, Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? If God took away your hearing and your sight, and
					set a seal on your hearts, what god other than God would restore them to you?"
					Note how We explain the revelations in various ways, yet they still turn away.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? if God's punishment descended on you suddenly or
					gradually, would any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					We sent the messengers only as bearers of good news and as warners. Those who
					believe and reform have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					But as for those who reject Our revelations, torment will afflict them because
					of their defiance.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					Say, "I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of God, nor do I know
					the future, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only follow what is
					inspired to me." Say, "Are the blind and the seeing alike? Do you not think?"
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					And warn with it those who fear to be gathered before their Lord-they have no
					protector or intercessor apart from Him-perhaps they will grow in piety.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening,
					seeking His attention. You are not accountable for them in any way, nor are
					they accountable for you in any way. If you drive them away, you would be one
					of the unjust.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Thus We try some of them by means of others, that they may say, "Are these the
					ones whom God has favored from among us?" Is God not aware of the appreciative?
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, "Peace be upon you,
					your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. Whoever among you does wrong out of
					ignorance, and then repents afterwards and reforms-He is Forgiving and
					Merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Thus We explain the revelations, and expose the path of the unrighteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Say, "I am forbidden from worshiping those you pray to besides God." Say, "I
					will not follow your desires; else I would be lost and not be of those guided."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Say, "I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and you have rejected Him. I do
					not possess what you seek me to hasten; the decision belongs solely to God. He
					states the truth, and He is the Best of Judges."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Say, "If I possessed what you seek me to hasten, the matter between you and me
					would have been settled. God is well aware of the unjust."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					With Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except He. And He knows
					everything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but He knows it; and there
					is not a single grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there anything wet or
					dry, but is in a clear record.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					It is He Who takes you by night, and He knows what you earn by day. Then He
					raises you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. Then to Him is your
					return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					He is the Conqueror over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until,
					when death overtakes one of you, Our envoys take him away, and they never fail.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					Then they are brought back to God, their True Master. Unquestionably, His is
					the judgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckoners.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Say, "Who delivers you from the darkness of land and sea?" You call upon Him
					humbly and inwardly: "If He delivers us from this, We will surely be among the
					thankful."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Say, "It is God who delivers you from it, and from every disaster. Yet then you
					associate others with Him."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Say, "He is Able to send upon you an affliction, from above you, or from under
					your feet. Or He can divide you into factions, and make you taste the violence
					of one another. Note how We explain the revelations, so that they may
					understand."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					But your people rejected it, though it is the truth. Say, "I am not responsible
					for you."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					For every happening is a finality, and you will surely know.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					When you encounter those who gossip about Our revelations, turn away from them,
					until they engage in another topic. But should Satan make you forget, do not
					sit after the recollection with the wicked people.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					The righteous are in no way accountable for them; it is only a reminder, that
					they may be careful.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					So leave alone those who take their religion for play and pastime, and whom the
					worldly life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a soul becomes damned on
					account of what it has earned. It has no helper or intercessor besides God.
					Even if it offers every equivalent, none will be accepted from it. These are
					the ones who are delivered to perdition by their actions. They will have a
					drink of scalding water, and a painful punishment, because they used to
					disbelieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					Say, "Shall we invoke besides God something that can neither benefit us nor
					harm us, and turn back on our heels after God has guided us; like someone
					seduced by the devils and confused on earth, who has friends calling him to
					guidance: 'Come to us'?" Say, "The guidance of God is the guidance, and we are
					commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Universe."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					"And to perform the prayers, and to revere Him; it is to Him that you will be

				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day when He
					says: "Be," it will be. His saying is the truth, and His is the sovereignty on
					the Day when the trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and declarations. He
					is the Wise, the Expert.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for gods? I see that you
					and your people are in evident error."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Thus We showed Abraham the empire of the heavens and the earth, that he might
					be one of those with certainty.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					When the night fell over him, he saw a planet. He said, "This is my lord." But
					when it set, he said, "I do not love those that set."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my lord." But when it set,
					he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will be one of the erring people."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my lord, this is bigger."
					But when it set, he said, "my people, I am innocent of your idolatry.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					I have directed my attention towards Him Who created the heavens and the
					earth-a monotheist-and I am not of the idolaters."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And his people argued with him. He said, "Do you argue with me about God, when
					He has guided me? I do not fear what you associate with Him, unless my Lord
					wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. Will you not reconsider?
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And why should I fear those you associate with Him, and you do not fear
					associating others with God for which He sent down to you no authority? Which
					side is more entitled to security, if you are aware?"
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and do not obscure their faith with wrongdoing-those will
					have security, and they are guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					That was Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We elevate
					by degrees whomever We will. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					And We gave him Isaac and Jacob-each of them We guided. And We guided Noah
					previously; and from his descendants David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph,
					and Moses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the righteous.

					And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and Elias-every one of them was of the
					upright.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and Lot-We favored each one of them over

				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 87

					And of their ancestors, and their descendants, and their siblings-We chose
					them, and guided them to a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Such is God's guidance. He guides with it whomever He wills of His servants.
					Had they associated, their deeds would have gone in vain.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					Those are they to whom We gave the Book, and wisdom, and prophethood. If these
					reject them, We have entrusted them to others who do not reject them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Those are they whom God has guided, so follow their guidance. Say, "I ask of
					you no compensation for it; it is just a reminder for all mankind."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					They do not value God as He should be valued, when they say, "God did not
					reveal anything to any human being." Say, "Who revealed the Scripture which
					Moses brought-a light and guidance for humanity?" You put it on scrolls,
					displaying them, yet concealing much. And you were taught what you did not
					know-neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, "God;" then leave them toying away
					in their speculation.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					This too is a Scripture that We revealed-blessed-verifying what preceded it,
					that you may warn the Mother of Cities and all around it. Those who believe in
					the Hereafter believe in it, and are dedicated to their prayers.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Who does greater wrong than someone who invents falsehood against God, or says,
					"It was revealed to me," when nothing was revealed to him, or says, "I will
					reveal the like of what God revealed"? If only you could see the wrongdoers in
					the floods of death, as the angels with arms outstretched: "Give up your souls.
					Today you are being repaid with the torment of shame for having said about God
					other than the truth, and for being too proud to accept His revelations."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					"You have come to Us individually, just as We created you the first time,
					leaving behind you everything We gave you. We do not see with you your
					intercessors-those you claimed were your partners. The link between you is cut,
					and what you had asserted has failed you."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					It is God Who splits the grain and the seed. He brings the living from the
					dead, and He brings the dead from the living. Such is God. So how could you
					deviate?
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He made the night for rest, and the sun and
					the moon for calculation. Such is the disposition of the Almighty, the
					All-Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					And it is He Who created the stars for you, that you may be guided by them in
					the darkness of land and sea. We thus explain the revelations for people who
					know.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					And it is He who produced you from a single person, then a repository, then a
					depository. We have detailed the revelations for people who understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					And it is He who sends down water from the sky. With it We produce vegetation
					of all kinds, from which We bring greenery, from which We produce grains in
					clusters. And palm-trees with hanging clusters, and vineyards, and olives, and
					pomegranates-similar and dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they grow and ripen.
					Surely in this are signs for people who believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Yet they attributed to God partners-the sprites-although He created them. And
					they invented for Him sons and daughters, without any knowledge. Glory be to
					Him. He is exalted, beyond what they describe.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					Originator of the heavens and the earth-how can He have a son when He never had
					a companion? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Such is God, your Lord. There is no god except He, the Creator of all things;
					so worship Him. He is responsible for everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the Subtle,
					the Expert.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					"Insights have come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit
					of his soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its detriment. I am not a
					guardian over you."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					We thus diversify the revelations, lest they say, "You have studied," and to
					clarify them for people who know.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					Follow what was revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. And
					turn away from the polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Had God willed, they would not have practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you
					as a guardian over them, and you are not a manager over them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Do not insult those they call upon besides God, lest they insult God out of
					hostility and ignorance. We made attractive to every community their deeds.
					Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used
					to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					They swear by God, with their most solemn oaths, that if a miracle were to come
					to them, they would believe in it. Say, "The miracles are only with God." But
					how do you know? Even if it did come, they still would not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					And We turn away their hearts and their visions, as they refused to believe in
					it the first time, and We leave them blundering in their rebellion.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					Even if We sent down the angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We
					gathered all things before them, they still would not believe, unless God
					wills; but most of them are ignorant.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					Likewise, We have assigned for every prophet an enemy-human and jinn
					devils-inspiring one another with fancy words in order to deceive. But had your
					Lord willed, they would not have done it. So leave them to their fabrications.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					So that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to
					it, and be content with it, and that they may perpetrate whatever they
					perpetrate.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					"Shall I seek a judge other than God, when He is the One who revealed to you
					the Book, explained in detail?" Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is
					the truth revealed from your Lord. So do not be of those who doubt.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					The Word of your Lord has been completed, in truth and justice. There is no
					changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would divert you from God's
					path. They follow nothing but assumptions, and they only conjecture.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					Your Lord knows best who strays from His path, and He knows best the guided
					ones.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					So eat of that over which the Name of God was pronounced, if you indeed believe
					in His revelations.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God is pronounced,
					when He has detailed for you what is prohibited for you, unless you are
					compelled by necessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, through lack of
					knowledge. Your Lord knows best the transgressors.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					So abandon sin, outward and inward. Those who commit sins will be repaid for
					what they used to perpetrate.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					And do not eat from that over which the Name of God was not pronounced, for it
					is abomination. The devils inspire their followers to argue with you; but if
					you obey them, you would be polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, and made for him a light by which he
					walks among the people, like he who is in total darkness, and cannot get out of
					it? Thus the doings of disbelievers are made to appear good to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					And thus We set up in every city its leading wicked sinners, to conspire in it,
					but they conspire only against themselves, and they do not realize it.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					When a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe unless we are given
					the like of what was given to God's messengers." God knows best where to place
					His message. Humiliation from God and severe torment will afflict the criminals
					for their scheming.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					Whomever God desires to guide, He spreads open his heart to Islam; and whomever
					He desires to misguide, He makes his heart narrow, constricted, as though he
					were climbing up the sky. God thus lays defilement upon those who do not
					believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					This is the straight path of your Lord. We have explained the revelations in
					detail for people who recollect.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					For them is the Home of Peace with their Lord, and He is their Master-because
					of what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					On the Day when He gathers them all together: "assembly of jinn, you have
					exploited multitudes of humans." Their adherents among mankind will say, "Our
					Lord, we have profited from one another, but we have reached the term that you
					have assigned for us." He will say, "The Fire is your dwelling, wherein you
					will remain, except as God wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 129
			-
				-
					Thus We make some of the wrongdoers befriend one another, because of what they
					used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 130
			-
				-
					"assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among
					you, relating to you My revelations, and warning you of the meeting of this Day
					of yours?" They will say, "We testify against ourselves." The life of the world
					seduced them. They will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 131
			-
				-
					That is because your Lord would not destroy towns for injustice while their
					inhabitants are unaware.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 132
			-
				-
					They all have ranks according to what they did; and your Lord is not unaware of
					what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 133
			-
				-
					Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can
					do away with you, and substitute whomever He wills in your place, just as He
					produced you from the descendants of another people.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 134
			-
				-
					What you are promised is coming, and you cannot thwart it.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 135
			-
				-
					Say, "my people! Work according to your ability, and so will I." You will come
					to know to whom will belong the sequel of the abode." The wrongdoers will not
					prevail.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 136
			-
				-
					And they set aside for God a share of the crops and the livestock He created,
					and they say, "This is for God," according to their claim, "and this is for our
					idols." But the share of their idols does not reach God, yet the share of God
					reaches their idols. Evil is their judgment.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 137
			-
				-
					Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters to kill their children, in order to
					lead them to their ruin, and confuse them in their religion. Had God willed,
					they would not have done it; so leave them to their fraud.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 138
			-
				-
					And they say, "These animals and crops are restricted; none may eat them except
					those we permit," by their claims, and animals whose backs are forbidden, and
					animals over which they do not pronounce the name of God-fabricating lies
					against Him. He will repay them for what they used to invent.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 139
			-
				-
					And they say, "What lies in the wombs of these animals is exclusively for our
					males, and prohibited to our wives." But if it is stillborn, they can share in
					it. He will surely punish them for their allegations. He is Wise and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 140
			-
				-
					Lost are those who kill their children foolishly, with no basis in knowledge,
					and forbid what God has provided for them-innovations about God. They have gone
					astray. They are not guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 141
			-
				-
					It is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and date-palms, and
					crops of diverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar.
					Eat of its fruit when it yields, and give its due on the day of its harvest,
					and do not waste. He does not love the wasteful.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 142
			-
				-
					Among the livestock are some for transportation, and some for clothing. Eat of
					what God has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. He is
					to you an outright enemy.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 143
			-
				-
					Eight pairs: two of the sheep, and two of the goats. Say, "Did He forbid the
					two males, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain?
					Inform me with knowledge, if you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 144
			-
				-
					And two of the camels, and two of the cattle. Say, "Did He forbid the two
					males, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were
					you present when God enjoined this upon you?" Who does greater wrong than he
					who invents lies and attributes them to God, in order to mislead people without
					knowledge? God does not guide the wicked people.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 145
			-
				-
					Say, "In what was revealed to me, I find nothing forbidden to a consumer who
					eats it, except carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh of swine-because it is
					impure-or a sinful offering dedicated to other than God. But if someone is
					compelled by necessity, without being deliberate or malicious-your Lord is
					Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 146
			-
				-
					For the Jews We forbade everything with claws. As of cattle and sheep: We
					forbade them their fat, except what adheres to their backs, or the entrails, or
					what is mixed with bone. This is how We penalized them for their inequity. We
					are indeed truthful.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 147
			-
				-
					If they accuse you of lying, say, "Your Lord is Possessor of infinite mercy,
					but His wrath cannot be averted from the guilty people."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 148
			-
				-
					The polytheists will say, "Had God willed, we would not have practiced
					idolatry, nor would have our forefathers, nor would we have prohibited
					anything." Likewise those before them lied, until they tasted Our might. Say,
					"Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow nothing but
					conjecture, and you only guess."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 149
			-
				-
					Say, "To God belongs the conclusive argument. Had He willed, He would have
					guided you all."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 150
			-
				-
					Say, "Produce your witnesses who would testify that God has prohibited this."
					If they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the whims of those
					who deny Our revelation, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and
					those who equate others with their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 151
			-
				-
					Say, "Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you
					associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill
					your children because of poverty-We provide for you and for them; that you do
					not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill
					the soul which God has sanctified-except in the course of justice. All this He
					has enjoined upon you, so that you may understand."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 152
			-
				-
					And do not come near the property of the orphan, except with the best
					intentions, until he reaches maturity. And give full weight and full measure,
					equitably. We do not burden any soul beyond its capacity. And when you speak,
					be fair, even if it concerns a close relative. And fulfill your covenant with
					God. All this He has enjoined upon you, so that you may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 153
			-
				-
					This is My path, straight, so follow it. And do not follow the other paths,
					lest they divert you from His path. All this He has enjoined upon you, that you
					may refrain from wrongdoing.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 154
			-
				-
					Then We gave Moses the Scripture, perfect for the righteous, and explaining
					everything clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that they may believe in the
					encounter with their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 155
			-
				-
					This too is a blessed Scripture that We revealed; so follow it, and be
					righteous, that you may receive mercy.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 156
			-
				-
					Lest you say, "The Scripture was revealed to two parties before us, and we were
					unaware of their teachings."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 157
			-
				-
					Or lest you say, "Had the Scripture been revealed to us, we would have been
					better guided than they." Clarification has come to you from your Lord, and
					guidance, and mercy. Who then does greater wrong than he who gives the lie to
					God's messages, and turns away from them? We will repay those who turn away
					from Our messages with the worst kind of punishment, because of their turning
					away.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 158
			-
				-
					Are they waiting for anything but for the angels to come to them, or for your
					Lord to arrive, or for some of your Lord's signs to come? On the Day when some
					of your Lord's signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith unless it had
					believed previously, or had earned goodness through its faith. Say, "Wait, we
					too are waiting."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 159
			-
				-
					As for those who divided their religion and became sects-you have nothing to do
					with them. Their case rests with God; then He will inform them of what they
					used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 160
			-
				-
					Whoever comes up with a good deed will have ten times its like; and whoever
					comes up with an evil deed will be repaid only with its equivalent-they will
					not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 161
			-
				-
					Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, an upright religion, the creed
					of Abraham the Monotheist, who was not a polytheist."
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 162
			-
				-
					Say, "My prayer and my worship, and my life and my death, are devoted to God,
					the Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 163
			-
				-
					No associate has He. Thus I am commanded, and I am the first of those who
					submit.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 164
			-
				-
					Say, "Am I to seek a Lord other than God, when He is the Lord of all things?"
					No soul gets except what it is due, and no soul bears the burdens of another.
					Then to your Lord is your return, then He will inform you regarding your
					disputes.
				-
			-
				Surah 6 - The Cattle: Ayah 165
			-
				-
					It is He who made you successors on the earth, and raised some of you in ranks
					over others, in order to test you through what He has given you. Your Lord is
					Quick in retribution, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.

			-
				-
					And he swore to them, "I am a sincere advisor to you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					So he lured them with deceit. And when they tasted the tree, their nakedness
					became evident to them, and they began covering themselves with the leaves of
					the Garden. And their Lord called out to them, "Did I not forbid you from this
					tree, and say to you that Satan is a sworn enemy to you?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					They said, "Our Lord, we have done wrong to ourselves. Unless You forgive us,
					and have mercy on us, we will be among the losers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					He said, "Fall, some of you enemies to one another. On earth you will have
					residence and livelihood for a while."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					He said, "In it you will live, and in it you will die, and from it you will be
					brought out."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					O children of Adam! We have provided you with clothing to cover your bodies,
					and for luxury. But the clothing of piety-that is best. These are some of God's
					revelations, so that they may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan seduce you, as he drove your parents out
					of the Garden, stripping them of their garments, to show them their nakedness.
					He sees you, him and his clan, from where you cannot see them. We have made the
					devils friends of those who do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					And when they commit an indecency, they say, "We found our parents doing this,
					and God has commanded us to do it." Say, "God does not command indecencies. Are
					you attributing to God what you do not know?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					Say, "My Lord commands justice, and to stand devoted at every place of worship.
					So call upon Him, and dedicate your faith to Him alone. Just as He originated
					you, so you will return."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Some He has guided, and some have deserved misguidance. They have adopted the
					devils for patrons rather than God, and they assume that they are guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					O Children of Adam! Dress properly at every place of worship, and eat and
					drink, but do not be excessive. He does not love the excessive.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Say, "Who forbade God's finery which He has produced for His servants, and the
					delights of livelihood?" Say, "They are for those who believe, in this present
					world, but exclusively theirs on the Day of Resurrection." We thus detail the
					revelations for people who know.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Say, "My Lord has forbidden immoralities-both open and secret-and sin, and
					unjustified aggression, and that you associate with God anything for which He
					revealed no sanction, and that you say about God what you do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					For every nation is an appointed time. When their time has come, they cannot
					delay it by one hour, nor can they advance it.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					O Children of Adam! When messengers from among you come to you, relating to you
					My revelations-whoever practices piety and reforms-upon them shall be no fear,
					nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					But as for those who reject Our revelations, and are too proud to accept
					them-these are the inmates of the Fire, where they will remain forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Who does greater wrong than he who invents lies about God, or denies His
					revelations? These-their share of the decree will reach them. Until, when Our
					envoys come to them, to take their souls away, they will say, "Where are they
					whom you used to pray to besides God?" They will say, "They have abandoned us,"
					and they will testify against themselves that they were faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					He will say, "Join the crowds of jinn and humans who have gone into the Fire
					before you." Every time a crowd enters, it will curse its sister-crowd. Until,
					when they are all in it, the last of them will say to the first of them, "Our
					Lord, these are the ones who misled us, so inflict on them a double punishment
					in the Fire." He will say, "Each will have a double, but you do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					The first of them will say to the last of them, "You have no advantage over us,
					so taste the torment for what you used to earn."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Those who reject Our revelations and are too arrogant to uphold them-the doors
					of Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise, until the
					camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus We repay the guilty.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					For them is a couch of hell, and above them are sheets of fire. Thus We repay
					the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					As for those who believe and do righteous works-We never burden any soul beyond
					its capacity-these are the inhabitants of the Garden; abiding therein
					eternally.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					We will remove whatever rancor is in their hearts. Rivers will flow beneath
					them. And they will say, "Praise be to God, who has guided us to this. Had God
					not guided us, we would never be guided. The messengers of our Lord did come
					with the truth." And it will be proclaimed to them, "This is the Garden you are
					made to inherit, on account of what you used to do."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					And the inhabitants of the Garden will call out to the inmates of the Fire, "We
					found what our Lord promised us to be true; did you find what your Lord
					promised you to be true?" They will say, "Yes." Thereupon a caller will
					announce in their midst, "The curse of God is upon the wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					"Those who hinder from the path of God, and seek to distort it, and who deny
					the Hereafter."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					And between them is a partition, and on the Elevations are men who recognize
					everyone by their features. They will call to the inhabitants of the Garden,
					"Peace be upon you." They have not entered it, but they are hoping.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And when their eyes are directed towards the inmates of the Fire, they will
					say, "Our Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing people."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And the dwellers of the Elevations will call to men they recognize by their
					features, saying, "Your hoardings did not avail you, nor did your arrogance."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					"Are these the ones you swore God will not touch with mercy?" "Enter the
					Garden; you have nothing to fear, and you will not grieve."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					The inmates of the Fire will call on the inhabitants of the Garden, "Pour some
					water over us, or some of what God has provided for you." They will say, "God
					has forbidden them for the disbelievers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					Those who took their religion lightly, and in jest, and whom the worldly life
					deceived. Today We will ignore them, as they ignored the meeting on this Day of
					theirs, and they used to deny Our revelations.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					We have given them a Scripture, which We detailed with knowledge-guidance and
					mercy for people who believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Are they waiting for anything but its fulfillment? The Day its fulfillment
					comes true, those who disregarded it before will say, "The messengers of our
					Lord did come with the truth. Have we any intercessors to intercede for us? Or,
					could we be sent back, to behave differently from the way we behaved before?"
					They ruined their souls, and what they used to invent has failed them.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Your Lord is God; He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then
					established Himself on the Throne. The night overtakes the day, as it pursues
					it persistently; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are subservient by
					His command. His is the creation, and His is the command. Blessed is God, Lord
					of all beings.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Call upon your Lord humbly and privately. He does not love the aggressors.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					And do not corrupt on earth after its reformation, and pray to Him with fear
					and hope. God's mercy is close to the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					It is He who sends the wind ahead of His mercy. Then, when they have gathered
					up heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land, where We make water come down,
					and with it We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We bring out the
					dead-perhaps you will reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					As for the good land, it yields its produce by the leave of its Lord. But as
					for the bad, it produces nothing but hardship and misery. Thus We explain the
					revelations in various ways for people who are thankful.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					We sent Noah to his people. He said, "my people! Worship God; you have no god
					other than Him. I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					The dignitaries among his people said, "We see that you are in obvious error."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					He said, "my people, I am not in error, but I am a messenger from the Lord of
					the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					"I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I advise you, and I know from
					God what you do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					"Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord, through a man
					from among you, to warn you, and to lead you to righteousness, so that you may
					attain mercy?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					But they called him a liar. So We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and
					We drowned those who rejected Our revelations. They were blind people.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, "my people! Worship God; you have no
					god other than Him. Will you not take heed?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					The elite of his people who disbelieved said, "We see foolishness in you, and
					we think that you are a liar."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					He said, "my people! There is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from
					the Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					"I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I am a trustworthy adviser to
					you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					"Are you surprised that a reminder has come to you from your Lord, through a
					man from among you, to warn you? Remember how He made you successors after the
					people of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature. And remember God's
					blessings, so that you may prosper."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					They said, "Did you come to us to make us worship God alone, and abandon what
					our ancestors used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if you
					are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					He said, "Condemnation and wrath have befallen you from your Lord. Are you
					arguing with me over names, which you and your ancestors invented, for which
					God sent down no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					So We saved him and those with him, by mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots
					of those who rejected Our revelations and were not believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He said, "my people! Worship God; you have
					no god other than Him. Clarification has come to you from your Lord. This
					she-camel of God is a sign for you. So leave her to graze on God's earth, and
					do her no harm, lest a painful penalty seizes you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					"And remember how He made you successors after Aad, and settled you in the
					land. You make for yourselves mansions on its plains, and carve out dwellings
					in the mountains. So remember God's benefits, and do not roam the earth
					corruptingly."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					The elite of his people, who were arrogant, said to the common people who had
					believed, "Do you know that Saleh is sent from his Lord?" They said, "We are
					believers in what he was sent with."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					Those who were arrogant said, "We reject what you believe in."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					So they hamstrung the she-camel, and defied the command of their Lord, and
					said, "Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are one of the
					messengers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Whereupon the quake overtook them, and they became lifeless bodies in their
					homes.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Then he turned away from them, and said, "my people, I have delivered to you
					the message of my Lord, and I have advised you, but you do not like those who
					give advice."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit lewdness no people anywhere
					have ever committed before you?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					"You lust after men rather than women. You are an excessive people."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					And his people's only answer was to say, "Expel them from your town; they are
					purist people."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					But We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who
					lagged behind.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					And We rained down on them a rain; note the consequences for the sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He said, "my people, worship God; you have
					no god other than Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord. Give full
					measure and weight, and do not cheat people out of their rights, and do not
					corrupt the land once it has been set right. This is better for you, if you are
					believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					"And do not lurk on every path, making threats and turning away from the path
					of God those who believe in Him, seeking to distort it. And remember how you
					were few, and how He made you numerous. So note the consequences for the
					corrupters."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					"Since some of you believed in what I was sent with, and some did not believe,
					be patient until God judges between us; for He is the Best of Judges."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					The arrogant elite among his people said, "Shuaib, We will evict you from our
					town, along with those who believe with you, unless you return to our
					religion." He said, "Even if we are unwilling?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					"We would be fabricating falsehood against God, if we were to return to your
					religion, after God has saved us from it. It is not for us to return to it,
					unless God, our Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in knowledge. In God
					we place our trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, for
					You are the Best of Deciders."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					The elite of his people who disbelieved said, "If you follow Shuaib, you will
					be losers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Thereupon, the quake struck them; and they became lifeless bodies in their
					homes.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Those who rejected Shuaib-as if they never prospered therein. Those who
					rejected Shuaib-it was they who were the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					So he turned away from them, and said, "my people, I have delivered to you the
					messages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so why should I grieve over a
					disbelieving people?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					We did not send any prophet to any town but We afflicted its people with misery
					and adversity, so that they may humble themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					Then We substituted prosperity in place of hardship. Until they increased in
					number, and said, "Adversity and prosperity has touched our ancestors." Then We
					seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Had the people of the towns believed and turned righteous, We would have opened
					for them the blessings of the heaven and the earth; but they rejected the
					truth, so We seized them by what they were doing.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them
					by night, while they sleep?
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them
					by day, while they play?
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Do they feel safe from God's plan? None feel safe from God's plan except the
					losing people.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Is it not guidance for those who inherit the land after its inhabitants, that
					if We willed, We could strike them for their sins? And seal up their hearts, so
					that they would not hear?
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					These towns-We narrate to you some of their tales. Their messengers came to
					them with the clear signs, but they would not believe in what they had rejected
					previously. Thus God seals the hearts of the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					We found most of them untrue to their covenants; We found most of them corrupt.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his
					establishment, but they denounced them. So consider the end of the evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					Moses said, "Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					"It is only proper that I should not say about God anything other than the
					truth. I have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord, so let the
					Children of Israel go with me."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					He said, "If you brought a miracle, then present it, if you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					So he threw his staff, and it was an apparent serpent.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					And He pulled out his hand, and it was white to the onlookers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					The notables among Pharaoh's people said, "This is really a skilled magician."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					"He wants to evict you from your land, so what do you recommend?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					They said, "Put him off, and his brother, and send heralds to the cities."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					"And let them bring you every skillful magician."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said, "Surely there is a reward for us, if
					we are the victors."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					He said, "Yes, and you will be among my favorites."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					They said, "Moses! Either you throw, or we are the ones to throw."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					He said, "You throw!" And when they threw, they beguiled the eyes of the
					people, and intimidated them, and produced a mighty magic.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					And We inspired Moses: "Throw your staff." And at once, it swallowed what they
					were faking.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					So the truth came to pass, and what they were producing came to nothing.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					There they were defeated, and utterly reduced.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					And the magicians fell to their knees.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					Pharaoh said, "Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? This
					is surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city, in order to expel its people
					from it. You will surely know."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					"I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will crucify
					you all."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					They said, "It is to our Lord that we will return."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					"You are taking vengeance on us only because we have believed in the signs of
					our Lord when they have come to us." "Our Lord! Pour out patience upon us, and
					receive our souls in submission."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, "Will you let Moses and his people cause
					trouble in the land, and forsake you and your gods?" He said, "We will kill
					their sons, and spare their women. We have absolute power over them."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					Moses said to his people, "Seek help in God, and be patient. The earth belongs
					to God. He gives it in inheritance to whomever He wills of His servants, and
					the future belongs to the righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 129
			-
				-
					They said, "We were persecuted before you came to us, and after you came to
					us." He said, "Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy, and make you
					successors in the land; then He will see how you behave."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 130
			-
				-
					And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with barren years, and with shortage of
					crops, that they may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 131
			-
				-
					When something good came their way, they said, "This is ours." And when
					something bad happened to them, they ascribed the evil omen to Moses and those
					with him. In fact, their omen is with God, but most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 132
			-
				-
					And they said, "No matter what sign you bring us, to bewitch us with, we will
					not believe in you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 133
			-
				-
					So We let loose upon them the flood, and the locusts, and the lice, and the
					frogs, and blood-all explicit signs-but they were too arrogant. They were a
					sinful people.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 134
			-
				-
					Whenever a plague befell them, they would say, "Moses, pray to your Lord for
					us, according to the covenant He made with you. If you lift the plague from us,
					we will believe in you, and let the Children of Israel go with you."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 135
			-
				-
					But when We lifted the plague from them, for a term they were to fulfill, they
					broke their promise.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 136
			-
				-
					So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea-because they rejected
					Our signs, and paid no heed to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 137
			-
				-
					And We made the oppressed people inherit the eastern and western parts of the
					land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the Children
					of Israel was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And We destroyed what
					Pharaoh and his people had built, and what they had harvested.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 138
			-
				-
					And We delivered the Children of Israel across the sea. And when they came upon
					a people who were devoted to some statues of theirs, they said, "Moses, make
					for us a god, as they have gods." He said, "You are truly an ignorant people."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 139
			-
				-
					"What these people are concerned with is perdition, and their deeds are based
					on falsehoods."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 140
			-
				-
					He said, "Shall I seek for you a god other than God, when He has favored you
					over all other people?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 141
			-
				-
					Remember how We saved you from Pharaoh's people, who subjected you to the worst
					of sufferings-killing your sons and sparing your women. In that was a
					tremendous trial from your Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 142
			-
				-
					And We appointed to Moses thirty nights, and completed them with ten; and thus
					the time appointed by his Lord was forty nights. And Moses said to his brother
					Aaron: "Take my place among my people, and be upright, and do not follow the
					way of the mischief-makers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 143
			-
				-
					And when Moses came to Our appointment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, "My
					Lord, allow me to look and see You." He said, "You will not see Me, but look at
					the mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see Me." But when his Lord
					manifested Himself to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and Moses fell down
					unconscious. Then, when he recovered, he said, "Glory be to you, I repent to
					you, and I am the first of the believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 144
			-
				-
					He said, "Moses, I have chosen you over all people for My messages and for My
					Words. So take what I have given you, and be one of the thankful."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 145
			-
				-
					And We inscribed for him in the Tablets all kinds of enlightenments, and
					decisive explanation of all things. "Hold fast to them, and exhort your people
					to adopt the best of them. I will show you the fate of the sinners."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 146
			-
				-
					I will turn away from My revelations those who behave proudly on earth without
					justification. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it; and if
					they see the path of rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and if they
					see the path of error, they will adopt it for a path. That is because they
					denied Our revelations, and paid no attention to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 147
			-
				-
					Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter-their deeds
					will come to nothing. Will they be repaid except according to what they used to
					do?
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 148
			-
				-
					In his absence, the people of Moses adopted a calf made from their ornaments-a
					body which lowed. Did they not see that it could not speak to them, nor guide
					them in any way? They took it for worship. They were in the wrong.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 149
			-
				-
					Then, when they regretted, and realized that they had erred, they said, "Unless
					our Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives us, we will be among the
					losers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 150
			-
				-
					And when Moses returned to his people, angry and disappointed, he said, "What
					an awful thing you did in my absence. Did you forsake the commandments of your
					Lord so hastily?" And he threw down the tablets; and he took hold of his
					brother's head, dragging him towards himself. He said, "Son of my mother, the
					people have overpowered me, and were about to kill me; so do not allow the
					enemies to gloat over me, and do not count me among the unjust people."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 151
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for
					you are the Most Merciful of the merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 152
			-
				-
					Those who idolized the calf have incurred wrath from their Lord, and
					humiliation in this life. We thus requite the innovators.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 153
			-
				-
					As for those who commit sins, and then repent afterwards and believe-your Lord,
					thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 154
			-
				-
					When the anger abated in Moses, he took up the tablets. In their transcript is
					guidance and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 155
			-
				-
					And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment. When the
					tremor shook them, he said, "My Lord, had You willed, You could have destroyed
					them before, and me too. Will you destroy us for what the fools among us have
					done? This is but Your test-with it You misguide whomever You will, and guide
					whomever You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us, and have mercy on us.
					You are the Best of Forgivers."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 156
			-
				-
					"And inscribe for us goodness in this world, and in the Hereafter. We have
					turned to You." He said, "My punishment-I inflict it upon whomever I will, but
					My mercy encompasses all things. I will specify it for those who act
					righteously and practice regular charity, and those who believe in Our signs."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 157
			-
				-
					Those who follow the Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, whom they find
					mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel in their possession. He directs them to
					righteousness, and deters them from evil, and allows for them all good things,
					and prohibits for them wickedness, and unloads the burdens and the shackles
					that are upon them. Those who believe in him, and respect him, and support him,
					and follow the light that came down with him-these are the successful.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 158
			-
				-
					Say, "people, I am the Messenger of God to you all-He to whom belongs the
					kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and
					causes death." So believe in God and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who
					believes in God and His words. And follow him, that you may be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 159
			-
				-
					Among the people of Moses is a community that guides by truth, and thereby does
					justice.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 160
			-
				-
					We divided them into twelve tribal communities. And We inspired Moses, when his
					people asked him for something to drink: "Strike the rock with your staff."
					Whereupon twelve springs gushed from it. Each group recognized its
					drinking-place. And We shaded them with clouds, and We sent down upon them
					manna and quails: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." They did
					not wrong Us, but they used to wrong their own selves.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 161
			-
				-
					And it was said to them, "Settle this town, and eat therein whatever you wish,
					and speak modestly, and enter the gate in humility-We will forgive your sins,
					and will promote the righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 162
			-
				-
					But the wicked among them substituted other words for the words given to them;
					so We sent down upon them a plague from the sky, because of their wrongdoing.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 163
			-
				-
					Ask them about the town by the sea, when they violated the Sabbath. When they
					observed the Sabbath, their fish would come to them abundantly. But when they
					violated the Sabbath, their fish would not come to them. Thus We tried them
					because they disobeyed.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 164
			-
				-
					And when a group of them said, "Why do you counsel a people whom God will
					annihilate, or punish with a severe punishment?" They said, "As an excuse to
					your Lord, and so that they may become righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 165
			-
				-
					Then, when they neglected what they were reminded of, We saved those who
					prohibited evil, and We seized those who did wrong with a terrible punishment,
					because of their sinfulness.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 166
			-
				-
					Then, when they rebelled against the commands to refrain, We said to them, "Be
					despicable apes."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 167
			-
				-
					Your Lord has announced that, He would send against them, until the Day of
					Resurrection, those who would inflict terrible suffering upon them. Your Lord
					is swift in retribution, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 168
			-
				-
					And We scattered them into communities on earth. Some of them righteous, and
					some of them short of that. And We tested them with fortunes and misfortunes,
					so that they may return.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 169
			-
				-
					They were succeeded by generations who inherited the Scripture and chose the
					materials of this world, saying, "We will be forgiven." And should similar
					materials come their way, they would again seize them. Did they not make a
					covenant to uphold the Scripture, and to not say about God except the truth?
					Did they not study its contents? But the Home of the Hereafter is better for
					the cautious; will you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 170
			-
				-
					Those who adhere to the Scripture, and practice prayer-We will not waste the
					reward of the reformers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 171
			-
				-
					And when We suspended the mountain over them, as if it was an umbrella, and
					they thought it would fall on them: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and
					remember what it contains, so that you may be saved."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 172
			-
				-
					And when Your Lord summoned the descendants of Adam, and made them testify
					about themselves. "Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yes, we testify." Thus you
					cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, "We were unaware of this."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 173
			-
				-
					Nor can you Say, "Our ancestors practiced idolatry before; and we are their
					descendants who came after them; will you destroy us for what the falsifiers
					did?"
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 174
			-
				-
					We thus elaborate the revelations, so that they may return.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 175
			-
				-
					And relate to them the story of him to whom We delivered Our signs, but he
					detached himself from them, so Satan went after him, and he became one of the
					perverts.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 176
			-
				-
					Had We willed, We could have elevated him through them; but he clung to the
					ground, and followed his desires. His metaphor is that of a dog: if you chase
					it, it pants; and if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the metaphor of the
					people who deny Our signs. So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 177
			-
				-
					Evil is the metaphor of the people who reject Our signs and wrong themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 178
			-
				-
					Whomever God guides is the guided one. And whomever He sends astray-these are
					the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 179
			-
				-
					We have destined for Hell multitudes of jinn and humans. They have hearts with
					which they do not understand. They have eyes with which they do not see. They
					have ears with which they do not hear. These are like cattle. In fact, they are
					further astray. These are the heedless.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 180
			-
				-
					To God belong the Most Beautiful Names, so call Him by them, and disregard

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 181
			-
				-
					Among those We created is a community-they guide by truth, and do justice

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 182
			-
				-
					As for those who reject Our messages, We will gradually lead them from where

			-
				-
					And I will encourage them. My plan is firm.
				-

				-
					Do they not think? There is no madness in their friend. He is but a plain

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 185
			-
				-
					Have they not observed the government of the heavens and the earth, and all the

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 186
			-
				-
					Whomever God misguides has no guide. And He leaves them blundering in their

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 187
			-
				-
					They ask you about the Hour, "When will it come?" Say, "Knowledge of it rests
					with my Lord. None can reveal its coming except He. It weighs heavily on the
					heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly." They ask you
					as if you are responsible for it. Say, "Knowledge of it rests with God," but
					most people do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 188
			-
				-
					Say, "I have no control over any benefit or harm to myself, except as God
					wills. Had I known the future, I would have acquired much good, and no harm
					would have touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald of good news to a
					people who believe."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 189
			-
				-
					It is He who created you from a single person, and made from it its mate, that
					he may find comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a
					light load, and she carries it around. But when she has grown heavy, they pray
					to God their Lord, "if You give us a good child, we will be among the
					thankful."
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 190
			-
				-
					But when He has given them a good child, they attribute partners to Him in what
					He has given them. God is exalted above what they associate.
				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 191
			-
				-
					Do they idolize those who create nothing, and are themselves created?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					And can neither help them, nor help their own selves?
				-
			-

					And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 194
			-
				-
					Those you call upon besides God are servants like you. So call upon them, and

				-
			-
				Surah 7 - The Heights: Ayah 195
			-
				-
					Do they have feet with which they walk? Or do they have hands with which they
					strike? Or do they have eyes with which they see? Or do they have ears with
					which they hear? Say, "Call upon your partners, then plot against me, and do
					not wait."

			-
				-
					If you do not produce a miracle for them, they say, "Why don't you improvise

					Those who perform the prayer; and from Our provisions to them, they spend.

			-
				-
					Even as your Lord brought you out of your home with the truth, some believers

					Arguing with you about the truth after it was made clear, as if they were being

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					God has promised you one of the two groups-that it would be yours-but you

					And know that your possessions and your children are a test, and that God

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					O you who believe! If you remain conscious of God, He will give you a
					criterion, and will remit from you your sins, and will forgive you. God is
					possessor of infinite grace.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					When the disbelievers plotted against you, to imprison you, or kill you, or
					expel you. They planned, and God planned, but God is the Best of planners.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					And when Our revelations are recited to them, they say, "We have heard. Had we
					wanted, we could have said the like of this; these are nothing but myths of the
					ancients."
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					And they said, "Our God, if this is the truth from You, then rain down on us
					stones from the sky, or visit us with a painful affliction."
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					But God would not punish them while you are amongst them. And God would not
					punish them as long as they seek forgiveness.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Yet why should God not punish them, when they are turning others away from the
					Sacred Mosque, although they are not its custodians? Its rightful custodians
					are the pious; but most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Their prayer at the House was nothing but whistling and clapping-so taste the
					punishment for your blasphemy.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to repel from God's path. They will
					spend it, then it will become a source of sorrow for them, and then they will
					be defeated. Those who disbelieve will be herded into Hell.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					That God may distinguish the bad from the good, and heap the bad on top of one
					another, and pile them together, and throw them in Hell. These are the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					Say to those who disbelieve: if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But
					if they persist-the practice of the ancients has passed away.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Fight them until there is no more persecution, and religion becomes exclusively
					for God. But if they desist-God is Seeing of what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					And if they turn away, know that God is your Protector. The Best Protector, and
					the Best Supporter.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					And know that whatever spoils you gain, to God belongs its fifth, and to the
					Messenger, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and to the
					wayfarer, provided you believe in God and in what We revealed to Our servant on
					the Day of Distinction, the day when the two armies met. God is Capable of
					everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Recall when you were on the nearer bank, and they were on the further bank, and
					the caravan was below you. Had you planned for this meeting, you would have
					disagreed on the timing, but God was to carry out a predetermined matter, so
					that those who perish would perish by clear evidence, and those who survive
					would survive by clear evidence. God is Hearing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					God made them appear in your dream as few. Had He made them appear as many, you
					would have lost heart, and disputed in the matter. But God saved the situation.
					He knows what the hearts contain.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					When you met, He made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear
					fewer in their eyes, so that God may conclude a predetermined matter. To God
					all matters revert.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					O you who believe! When you meet a force, stand firm, and remember God much, so
					that you may prevail.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					And obey God and His Messenger, and do not dispute, lest you falter and lose

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And do not be like those who left their homes boastfully, showing off before
					the people, and barring others from the path of God. God comprehends what they
					do.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					Satan made their deeds appear good to them, and said, "You cannot be defeated
					by any people today, and I am at your side." But when the two armies came in
					sight of one another, he turned on his heels, and said, "I am innocent of you;
					I see what you do not see; I fear God; God is severe in punishment."
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					The hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said, "Their religion has
					deluded these people." But whoever puts his trust in God-God is Mighty and
					Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					If only you could see, as the angels take away those who disbelieve, striking

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					"That is because of what your hands have committed, and because God is not
					unjust to the servants."
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them. They
					rejected the signs of God, so God seized them for their sins. God is Powerful,
					Severe in punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					That is because God would never change a blessing He has bestowed on a people
					unless they change what is within themselves, and because God is Hearing and
					Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Such was the case with the people of Pharaoh, and those before them. They
					denied the signs of their Lord, so We annihilated them for their wrongs, and We
					drowned the people of Pharaoh-they were all evildoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					The worst of creatures in God's view are those who disbelieve. They have no
					faith.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Those of them with whom you made a treaty, but they violate their agreement
					every time. They are not righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					If you confront them in battle, make of them a fearsome example for those who
					follow them, that they may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					If you fear treachery on the part of a people, break off with them in a like

				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Let not the disbelievers assume that they are ahead. They will not escape.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					And prepare against them all the power you can muster, and all the cavalry you
					can mobilize, to terrify thereby God's enemies and your enemies, and others
					besides them whom you do not know, but God knows them. Whatever you spend in
					God's way will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					But if they incline towards peace, then incline towards it, and put your trust
					in God. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					If they intend to deceive you-God is sufficient for you. It is He who supported
					you with His aid, and with the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					And He united their hearts. Had you spent everything on earth, you would not
					have united their hearts, but God united them together. He is Mighty and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					O prophet! Count on God, and on the believers who have followed you.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If there are twenty steadfast among
					you, they will defeat two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will
					defeat a thousand of those who disbelieve; because they are a people who do not
					understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					God has now lightened your burden, knowing that there is weakness in you. If
					there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will defeat two hundred; and if
					there are a thousand of you, they will defeat two thousand by God's leave. God
					is with the steadfast.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					It is not for a prophet to take prisoners before he has subdued the land. You
					desire the materials of this world, but God desires the Hereafter. God is
					Strong and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Were it not for a predetermined decree from God, an awful punishment would have

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					So consume what you have gained, legitimate and wholesome; and remain conscious

				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, "If God finds any good in your
					hearts, He will give you better than what was taken from you, and He will
					forgive you. God is Forgiving and Merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					But if they intend to betray you, they have already betrayed God, and He has
					overpowered them. God is Knowing and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					Those who believed, and emigrated, and struggled in God's cause with their
					possessions and their persons, and those who provided shelter and support-these
					are allies of one another. As for those who believed, but did not emigrate, you
					owe them no protection, until they have emigrated. But if they ask you for help
					in religion, you must come to their aid, except against a people with whom you
					have a treaty. God is Seeing of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					As for those who disbelieve, they are allies of one another. Unless you do
					this, there will be turmoil in the land, and much corruption.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Those who believed, and emigrated, and struggled for God's cause, and those who
					gave shelter and support-these are the true believers. They will have
					forgiveness, and a bountiful provision.
				-
			-
				Surah 8 - The Spoils of War: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					As for those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and struggled with
					you-these belong with you. But family members are nearer to one another in the
					Book of God. God is Cognizant of everything.

			Surah 9 - The Repentance
		-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists with
					whom you had made a treaty.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					So travel the land for four months, and know that you cannot escape God, and
					that God will disgrace the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					And a proclamation from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the
					Greater Pilgrimage, that God has disowned the polytheists, and so did His
					Messenger. If you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, know
					that you cannot escape God. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful
					punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did
					not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill the
					treaty with them to the end of its term. God loves the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find
					them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every
					ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let
					them go their way. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection
					so that he may hear the Word of God; then escort him to his place of safety.
					That is because they are a people who do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of God and His
					Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque?
					As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them. God loves the
					pious.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					How? Whenever they overcome you, they respect neither kinship nor treaty with
					you. They satisfy you with lip service, but their hearts refuse, and most of
					them are immoral.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					They traded away God's revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others
					from His path. How evil is what they did.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the
					transgressors.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity,
					then they are your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people
					who know.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion,
					then fight the leaders of disbelief-they have no faith-so that they may desist.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Will you not fight a people who violated their oaths, and planned to exile the
					Messenger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do you fear them? It is God
					you should fear, if you are believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Fight them. God will punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help
					you against them, and heal the hearts of a believing people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					And He will remove the anger of their hearts. God redeems whomever He wills.
					God is Knowledgeable and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					Or do you think that you will be left alone, without God identifying which of
					you will strive, and take no supporters apart from God, His Messenger, and the
					believers? God is well Aware of what you do.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					It is not for the polytheists to attend God's places of worship while
					professing their disbelief. These-their works are in vain, and in the Fire they
					will abide.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					The only people to attend God's places of worship are those who believe in God
					and the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice regular charity, and fear
					none but God. These are most likely to be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Do you consider giving water to pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the
					same as believing in God and the Last Day and striving in God's path? They are
					not equal in God's sight. God does not guide the unjust people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and emigrate, and strive in God's path with their
					possessions and their persons, are of a higher rank with God. These are the
					winners.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Their Lord announces to them good news of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					Abiding therein forever. With God is a great reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves with your parents and your siblings
					if they prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you allies himself with
					them-these are the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					Say, "If your parents, and your children, and your siblings, and your spouses,
					and your relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, and a business you worry
					about, and homes you love, are more dear to you than God, and His Messenger,
					and the struggle in His cause, then wait until God executes His judgment." God
					does not guide the sinful people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					God has given you victory in numerous regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your
					great number impressed you, but it availed you nothing; and the land, as
					spacious as it was, narrowed for you; and you turned your backs in retreat.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					Then God sent down His serenity upon His Messenger, and upon the believers; and
					He sent down troops you did not see; and He punished those who disbelieved.
					Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Then, after that, God will relent towards whomever He wills. God is Forgiving
					and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					O you who believe! The polytheists are polluted, so let them not approach the
					Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you fear poverty, God will
					enrich you from His grace, if He wills. God is Aware and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what God
					and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide by the religion of truth-from among
					those who received the Scripture-until they pay the due tax, willingly or
					unwillingly.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					The Jews said, "Ezra is the son of God," and the Christians said, "The Messiah
					is the son of God." These are their statements, out of their mouths. They
					emulate the statements of those who blasphemed before. May God assail them! How
					deceived they are!
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					They have taken their rabbis and their priests as lords instead of God, as well
					as the Messiah son of Mary. Although they were commanded to worship none but
					The One God. There is no god except He. Glory be to Him; High above what they
					associate with Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					They want to extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God refuses except
					to complete His light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, in
					order to make it prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike
					it.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and priests consume people's wealth
					illicitly, and hinder from God's path. Those who hoard gold and silver, and do
					not spend them in God's cause, inform them of a painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					On the Day when they will be heated in the Fire of Hell, then their foreheads,
					and their sides, and their backs will be branded with them: "This is what you
					hoarded for yourselves; so taste what you used to hoard."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					The number of months, according to God, is twelve months-in the decree of
					God-since the Day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are
					sacred. This is the correct religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them.
					And fight the polytheists collectively, as they fight you collectively, and
					know that God is with the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Postponement is an increase in disbelief-by which those who disbelieve are led
					astray. They allow it one year, and forbid it another year, in order to conform
					to the number made sacred by God, thus permitting what God has forbidden. The
					evil of their deeds seems good to them. God does not guide the disbelieving
					people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					O you who believe! What is the matter with you, when it is said to you,
					"Mobilize in the cause of God," you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer
					the present life to the Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, compared
					to the Hereafter, is only a little.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Unless you mobilize, He will punish you most painfully, and will replace you
					with another people, and you will not harm Him at all. God has power over all
					things.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					If you do not help him, God has already helped him, when those who disbelieved
					expelled him, and he was the second of two in the cave. He said to his friend,
					"Do not worry, God is with us." And God made His tranquility descend upon him,
					and supported him with forces you did not see, and made the word of those who
					disbelieved the lowest, while the Word of God is the Highest. God is Mighty and
					Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with your possessions and your lives in
					the cause of God. That is better for you, if you only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Had the gain been immediate, and the journey shorter, they would have followed
					you; but the distance seemed too long for them. Still they swear by God: "Had
					we been able, we would have marched out with you." They damn their own souls,
					and God knows that they are lying.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					May God pardon you! Why did you give them permission before it became clear to
					you who are the truthful ones, and who are the liars?
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from
					striving with their possessions and their lives. God is fully aware of the
					righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Only those who do not believe in God and the Last Day ask you for exemption.
					Their hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in their doubts.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Had they wanted to mobilize, they would have made preparations for it; but God
					disliked their participation, so he held them back, and it was said, "Stay
					behind with those who stay behind."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Had they mobilized with you, they would have added only to your difficulties,
					and they would have spread rumors in your midst, trying to sow discord among
					you. Some of you are avid listeners to them. God is Aware of the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					They tried to cause conflict before, and they hatched plots against you, until
					the truth prevailed, and the command of God became evident-in spite of their
					dislike.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Among them is he who says, "Excuse me, and do not trouble me." In fact, they
					sunk into trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					If something good happens to you, it upsets them; and if a calamity befalls
					you, they say, "We took our precautions in advance," and they depart, happy.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					Say, "Nothing will happen to us except what God has ordained for us; He is our
					Protector." In God let the faithful put their trust.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Say, "Are you expecting for us anything other than one of the two excellences?
					As for us: we are expecting that God will afflict you with a punishment from

					Say, "Whether you spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from
					you. You are evil people."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					What prevents the acceptance of their contributions is nothing but the fact
					that they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and that they do not approach
					the prayer except lazily, and that they do not spend except grudgingly.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Let neither their possessions nor their children impress you. God intends to

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					They swear by God that they are of you. But they are not of you. They are

			-
				-
					Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a hideout, they would go to it,

			-
				-
					And among them are those who criticize you in regard to charities. If they are

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					If only they were content with what God and His Messenger have given them, and

					His Messenger; to God we eagerly turn."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Charities are for the poor, and the destitute, and those who administer them,
					and for reconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and for those in debt, and
					in the path of God, and for the traveler in need-an obligation from God. God is
					All-Knowing, Most Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					And among them are those who insult the Prophet, and say, "He is all ears."
					Say, "He listens for your own good. He believes in God, and trusts the
					believers, and is mercy for those of you who believe." Those who insult the
					Messenger of God will have a painful penalty.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					They swear to you by God to please you. But it is more proper for them to
					please God and His Messenger, if they are believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger, will have the Fire
					of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the supreme disgrace.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them
					of what is in their hearts. Say, "Go on mocking; God will bring out what you
					fear."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					If you ask them, they will say, "We were just joking and playing." Say, "Were

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Do not apologize. You have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon some of
					you, We will punish others, because they are guilty.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They advocate evil,
					and prohibit righteousness, and withhold their hands. They forgot God, so He
					forgot them. The hypocrites are the sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					God has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the disbelievers,
					the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their due. And God has cursed
					them. They will have a lasting punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Like those before you. They were more powerful than you, and had more wealth
					and children. They enjoyed their share, and you enjoyed your share, as those
					before you enjoyed their share. And you indulged, as they indulged. It is they
					whose works will fail in this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who are
					the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Have they not heard the stories of those before them? The people of Noah, and
					Aad, and Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and the inhabitants of Median, and
					the Overturned Cities? Their messengers came to them with the clear proofs. God
					never wronged them, but they used to wrong their own selves.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					The believing men and believing women are friends of one another. They advocate
					virtue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice charity, and obey God and
					His Messenger. These-God will have mercy on them. God is Noble and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					God promises the believers, men and women, gardens beneath which rivers flow,
					abiding therein forever, and fine homes in the Gardens of Eden. But approval
					from God is even greater. That is the supreme achievement.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern
					with them. Their abode is Hell-what a miserable destination!
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					They swear by God that they said nothing; but they did utter the word of
					blasphemy, and they renounced faith after their submission. And they plotted
					what they could not attain. They were resentful only because God and His
					Messenger have enriched them out of His grace. If they repent, it would be best
					for them; but if they turn away, God will afflict them with a painful
					punishment-in this life and in the Hereafter-and they will have on earth no
					protector and no savior.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Among them are those who promised God: "If He gives us of His bounty, we will
					donate and be among the upright."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					But when He has given them of His bounty, they became stingy with it, and
					turned away in aversion.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts, until the Day they face
					Him-because they broke their promise to God, and because they used to lie.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Do they not know that God knows their secrets and their conspiracies? And that
					God is the Knower of the unseen?
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Those who criticize the believers who give charity voluntarily, and ridicule
					those who find nothing to give except their own efforts-God ridicules them.
					They will have a painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them-even
					if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them. That
					is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger. God does not guide the
					immoral people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their staying behind the Messenger of God.
					And they hated to strive with their wealth and their lives in God's way. And
					they said, "Do not venture out in the heat." Say, "The Fire of Hell is much
					hotter, if they only understood."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in recompense for what they used to
					earn.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					If God brings you back to a party of them, and they ask your permission to go
					out, say, "You will not go out with me, ever, nor will you ever fight an enemy
					with me. You were content to sit back the first time, so sit back with those
					who stay behind."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					You are never to pray over anyone of them who dies, nor are you to stand at his
					graveside. They rejected God and His Messenger, and died while they were
					sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					Do not let their possessions and their children impress you. God desires to
					torment them through them in this world, and their souls expire while they are
					disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					When a chapter is revealed, stating: "Believe in God and strive with His
					Messenger," the prominent among them ask you for exemption. They say, "Allow us
					to stay with those who stay behind."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					They prefer to be with those who stay behind. Their hearts were sealed, so they
					do not understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					But the Messenger and those who believe with him struggle with their
					possessions and their lives. These have deserved the good things. These are the
					successful.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					God has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will
					abide forever. That is the great victory.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make excuses, asking to be granted exemption,
					while those who were untrue to God and His Messenger stayed behind. A painful
					punishment will afflict those among them who disbelieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					There is no blame on the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who have nothing
					to give, provided they are true to God and His Messenger. In no way can the
					righteous be blamed. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Nor on those who approach you, wishing to ride with you, and you said, "I have
					nothing to carry you on." So they went away, with their eyes overflowing with
					tears, sorrowing for not finding the means to spend.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					But blame is on those who ask you for exemption, although they are rich. They
					are content to be with those who stay behind. God has sealed their hearts, so
					they do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					They present excuses to you when you return to them. Say, "Do not offer
					excuses; we do not trust you; God has informed us of you. And God will watch
					your actions, and so will the Messenger; then you will be returned to the
					Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you
					used to do."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					They will swear to you by God, when you return to them, that you may leave them
					alone. So leave them alone. They are a disgrace, and their destiny is Hell; a
					reward for what they used to earn.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					They will swear to you that you may accept them. But even if you accept them,
					God does not accept the wicked people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most
					likely to ignore the limits that God revealed to His Messenger. God is Knowing
					and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					And among the Desert-Arabs are those who consider their contribution to be a
					fine. And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes. Upon them will fall the
					cycle of misfortune. God is Hearing and Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who believe in God and the Last Day, and
					consider their contribution to be a means towards God, and the prayers of the
					Messenger. Surely it will draw them closer, and God will admit them into His
					mercy. God is Forgiving and Compassionate.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					The Pioneers-The first of the Migrants and the Supporters, and those who
					followed them in righteousness. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased
					with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where
					they will abide forever. That is the sublime triumph.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					Among the Desert-Arabs around you there are some hypocrites, and among the
					inhabitants of Medina too. They have become adamant in hypocrisy. You do not
					know them, but We know them. We will punish them twice; then they will be
					returned to a severe torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Others have confessed their sins, having mixed good deeds with bad deeds.
					Perhaps God will redeem them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Receive contributions from their wealth, to purify them and sanctify them with
					it; and pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for them. God is Hearing and
					Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His servants, and that He
					receives the contributions, and that God is the Acceptor of Repentance, the
					Merciful?
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					Say, "Work. God will see your work, and so will His Messenger, and the

					and He will inform you of what you used to do."
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					Others are held in suspense, awaiting God's decree, as to whether He will
					punish them, or accept their repentance. God is Aware and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Then there are those who establish a mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and
					disunity among the believers, and as an outpost for those who fight God and His
					Messenger. They will swear: "Our intentions are nothing but good." But God
					bears witness that they are liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque founded upon piety from the first day is
					worthier of your standing in it. In it are men who love to be purified. God
					loves those who purify themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					Is he who founds his structure upon piety and acceptance from God better, or he
					who founds his structure on the brink of a cliff that is about to tumble, so it
					tumbles with him into the Fire of Hell? God does not guide the unjust people.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					The structure which they built will remain questionable in their hearts, until
					their hearts are stopped. God is Knowing and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					God has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in
					exchange for Paradise. They fight in God's way, and they kill and get killed.
					It is a promise binding on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Quran. And
					who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice in making such an
					exchange-that is the supreme triumph.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					Those who repent, those who worship, those who praise, those who journey, those
					who kneel, those who bow down, those who advocate righteousness and forbid
					evil, and those who keep God's limits-give good news to the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the
					polytheists, even if they are near relatives, after it has become clear to them
					that they are people of Hellfire.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					Abraham asked forgiveness for his father only because of a promise he had made
					to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, he
					disowned him. Abraham was kind and clement.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					God would never lead a people astray, after He had guided them, until He makes
					clear to them what they should guard against. God has knowledge of all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He
					causes death. And besides God, you have neither protector, nor supporter.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					God has redeemed the Prophet, and the Emigrants, and the Supporters-those who
					followed him in the hour of difficulty-after the hearts of some of them almost
					swerved. Then He pardoned them. He is Kind towards them, Compassionate.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					Also towards the three who were left behind. Then, when the earth, as vast as
					it is, closed in on them, and their very souls closed in on them, and they
					realized that there was no refuge from God, except in Him, He redeemed them, so
					that they may repent. God is the Redeemer, the Merciful.

			-
				-
					O you who believe! Be conscious of God, and be with the sincere.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and the Desert-Arabs around them to
					stay behind the Messenger of God, nor to prefer themselves to him. That is
					because they never suffer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the cause of
					God, nor do they take one step that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain
					anything from an enemy, but it is recorded to their credit as a righteous deed.
					God does not waste the reward of the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					Nor do they spend any expenditure, small or large, nor do they cross any

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					It is not advisable for the believers to march out altogether. Of every

					the religion, and to notify their people when they have returned to them, that
					they may beware.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who attack you, and let them

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of them say, "Which of you has this

					they rejoice.
				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 125
			-

					But as for those in whose hearts is sickness: it adds disgrace to their

				-
			-

			-
				-
					Do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					And whenever a chapter is revealed, they look at one another, "Does anyone see

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, concerned over your

				-
			-
				Surah 9 - The Repentance: Ayah 129

			-
				-
					Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired a man from among them: "Warn

				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then

					after His permission. Such is God, your Lord-so serve Him. Will you not
					reflect?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					To Him is your return, altogether. The promise of God is true. He originates
					creation, and then He repeats it, to reward those who believe and do good deeds
					with equity. As for those who disbelieve, for them is a drink of boiling water,
					and agonizing torment, on account of their disbelief.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					It is He who made the sun radiant, and the moon a light, and determined phases

					know.
				-

			-
				-
					Whenever adversity touches the human being, he prays to Us-reclining on his

					afflicted him. Thus the deeds of the transgressors appear good to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 13

					It is He who transports you across land and sea. Until, when you are on ships,
					sailing in a favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging wind arrives. The
					waves surge over them from every side, and they realize that they are besieged.
					Thereupon they pray to God, professing sincere devotion to Him: "If You save us
					from this, we will be among the appreciative."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					But then, when He has saved them, they commit violations on earth, and oppose
					justice. O people! Your violations are against your own souls. It is the
					enjoyment of the present life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform
					you of what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					The likeness of the present life is this: water that We send down from the sky
					is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which the people and the animals
					eat. Until, when the earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beautified, and
					its inhabitants think that they have mastered it, Our command descends upon it
					by night or by day, and We turn it into stubble, as if it had not flourished
					the day before. We thus clarify the revelations for people who reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					God invites to the Home of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to a straight
					path.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					For those who have done good is goodness, and more. Neither gloom nor shame
					will come over their faces. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding
					therein forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					As for those who have earned evil deeds: a reward of similar evil, and shame
					will cover them. They will have no defense against God-as if their faces are
					covered with dark patches of night. These are the inmates of the Fire, abiding
					therein forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					On the Day when We will gather them altogether, then say to those who ascribed
					partners, "To your place, you and your partners." Then We will separate between
					them, and their partners will say, "It was not us you were worshiping."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					"God is sufficient witness between us and you. We were unaware of your
					worshiping us."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					There, every soul will experience what it had done previously; and they will be
					returned to God, their True Master; and what they used to invent will fail
					them.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Say, "Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? And who controls the
					hearing and the sight? And who produces the living from the dead, and produces
					the dead from the living? And who governs the Order?" They will say, "God."
					Say, "Will you not be careful?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Such is God, your Lord-the True. What is there, beyond the truth, except
					falsehood? How are you turned away?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Thus your Lord's Word proved true against those who disobeyed, for they do not
					believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Say, "Can any of your partners initiate creation, and then repeat it?" Say,
					"God initiates creation, and then repeats it. How are you so deluded?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Say, "Can any of your partners guide to the truth?" Say, "God guides to the
					truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or he who
					does not guide, unless he himself is guided? What is the matter with you? How
					do you judge?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Most of them follow nothing but assumptions; and assumptions avail nothing
					against the truth. God is fully aware of what they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					This Quran could not have been produced by anyone other than God. In fact, it
					is a confirmation of what preceded it, and an elaboration of the Book. There is
					no doubt about it-it is from the Lord of the Universe.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say, "Then produce a single chapter like
					it, and call upon whomever you can, apart from God, if you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits of their knowledge, and whose
					explanation has not yet reached them. Thus those before them refused to
					believe. So note the consequences for the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Among them are those who believe in it, and among them are those who do not
					believe in it. Your Lord is fully aware of the mischief-makers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					If they accuse you of lying, say, "I have my deeds, and you have your deeds.
					You are quit of what I do, and I am quit of what you do."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And among them are those who listen to you. But can you make the deaf hear,
					even though they do not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And among them are those who look at you. But can you guide the blind, even
					though they do not see?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					God does not wrong the people in the least, but the people wrong their own
					selves.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					On the Day when He rounds them up-as if they had tarried only one hour of a
					day-they will recognize one another. Those who denied the meeting with God will
					be the losers. They were not guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Whether We show you some of what We promise them, or take you, to Us is their
					return. God is witness to everything they do.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Every community has a messenger. When their messenger has come, judgment will
					be passed between them with fairness, and they will not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And they say, "When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Say, "I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except as God wills. To every
					nation is an appointed time. Then, when their time arrives, they can neither
					postpone it by one hour, nor advance it.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? If His punishment overtakes you by night or by day,
					what part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					"Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? Now? When before you tried to
					hasten it?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Then it will be said to those who did wrong, "Taste the torment of eternity.
					Will you be rewarded except for what you used to do?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					And they inquire of you, "Is it true?" Say, "Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and
					you cannot evade it."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Had every soul which had done wrong possessed everything on earth, it would
					offer it as a ransom. They will hide the remorse when they witness the
					suffering, and it will be judged between them equitably, and they will not be
					wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Assuredly, to God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Assuredly,
					the promise of God is true. But most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					O people! There has come to you advice from your Lord, and healing for what is
					in the hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Say, "In God's grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is better than what they
					hoard."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered the sustenance God has sent down for you, some of
					which you made unlawful, and some lawful?" Say, "Did God give you permission,
					or do you fabricate lies and attribute them to God?"
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					What will they think-those who fabricate lies and attribute them to God-on the
					Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful towards the people, but most of them do
					not give thanks.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					You do not get into any situation, nor do you recite any Quran, nor do you do
					anything, but We are watching over you as you undertake it. Not even the weight
					of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything
					smaller or larger, but is in a clear record.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					Unquestionably, God's friends have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Those who believe and are aware.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					For them is good news in this life, and in the Hereafter. There is no
					alteration to the words of God. That is the supreme triumph.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					And let not their sayings dishearten you. All power is God's. He is the Hearer,
					the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Certainly, to God belongs everyone in the heavens and everyone on earth. Those
					who invoke other than God do not follow partners; they follow only assumptions,
					and they only guess.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					It is He who made the night for your rest, and the daylight for visibility.
					Surely in that are signs for people who listen.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					And they said, "God has taken a son." Be He glorified. He is the
					Self-Sufficient. His is everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Do
					you have any proof for this? Or are you saying about God what you do not know?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Say, "Those who fabricate lies about God will not succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us is their return; then We will make
					them taste the severe punishment on account of their disbelief.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					And relate to them the story of Noah, when he said to his people, "my people,
					if my presence among you and my reminding you of God's signs is too much for
					you, then in God I have put my trust. So come to a decision, you and your
					partners, and do not let the matter perplex you; then carry out your decision
					on me, and do not hold back."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					"But if you turn away, I have not asked you for any wage. My wage falls only on
					God, and I was commanded to be of those who submit."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					But they denounced him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We
					made them successors, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. So consider
					the fate of those who were warned.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Then, after him, We sent messengers to their people. They came to them with the
					clear proofs, but they would not believe in anything they had already rejected.
					Thus We set a seal on the hearts of the hostile.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his
					dignitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were sinful people.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					And when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "This is clearly sorcery."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Moses said, "Is this what you say of the truth when it has come to you? Is this
					sorcery? Sorcerers do not succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					They said, "Did you come to us to divert us from what we found our ancestors
					following, and so that you become prominent in the land? We will never believe
					in you."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Pharaoh said, "Bring me every experienced sorcerer."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, "Throw whatever you have to
					throw."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And when they threw, Moses said, "What you produced is sorcery, and God will
					make it fail. God does not foster the efforts of the corrupt."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					"And God upholds the truth with His words, even though the sinners detest it."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, for fear that
					Pharaoh and his chiefs would persecute them. Pharaoh was high and mighty in the
					land. He was a tyrant.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Moses said, "my people, if you have believed in God, then put your trust in
					Him, if you have submitted."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					They said, "In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, do not make us victims of
					the oppressive people."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					"And deliver us, by Your mercy, from the disbelieving people."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					And We inspired Moses and his brother, "Settle your people in Egypt, and make
					your homes places of worship, and perform the prayer, and give good news to the
					believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Moses said, "Our Lord, you have given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and
					wealth in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead away from Your path. Our
					Lord, obliterate their wealth, and harden their hearts, they will not believe
					until they see the painful torment."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					He said, "Your prayer has been answered, so go straight, and do not follow the
					path of those who do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					And We delivered the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops
					pursued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until, when he was about to drown, he
					said, "I believe that there is no god except the One the Children of Israel
					believe in, and I am of those who submit."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Now? When you have rebelled before, and been of the mischief-makers?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Today We will preserve your body, so that you become a sign for those after
					you. But most people are heedless of Our signs.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					And We settled the Children of Israel in a position of honor, and provided them
					with good things. They did not differ until knowledge came to them. Your Lord
					will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					If you are in doubt about what We revealed to you, ask those who read the
					Scripture before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord, so do not be of
					those who doubt.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					And do not be of those who deny God's revelations, lest you become one of the
					losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Those against whom your Lord's Word is justified will not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					Even if every sign comes to them-until they see the painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					If only there was one town that believed and benefited by its belief. Except
					for the people of Jonah. When they believed, We removed from them the suffering
					of disgrace in the worldly life, and We gave them comfort for a while.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth would have believed. Will you compel
					people to become believers?
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					No soul can believe except by God's leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who
					refuse to understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					Say, "Look at what is in the heavens and the earth." But signs and warnings are
					of no avail for people who do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Do they expect anything but the likes of the days of those who passed away
					before them? Say, "Then wait, I will be waiting with you."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Then We save Our messengers and those who believe. It is binding on Us to save
					the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					Say, "people, if you are in doubt about my religion-I do not serve those you
					serve apart from God. But I serve God, the one who will terminate your lives.
					And I was commanded to be of the believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					And dedicate yourself to the true religion-a monotheist-and never be of the
					polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					And do not call, apart from God, on what neither benefits you nor harms you. If
					you do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					If God afflicts you with harm, none can remove it except He. And if He wants
					good for you, none can repel His grace. He makes it reach whomever He wills of
					His servants. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Say, "people, the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever accepts
					guidance is guided for his own soul; and whoever strays only strays to its
					detriment. I am not a guardian over you."
				-
			-
				Surah 10 - Jonah: Ayah 109

					"And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and repent to Him. He will provide you with

				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days-and His Throne was

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					And if We postponed their punishment until a stated time, they would say, "What

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 9

					If We give the human being a taste of mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					And if We give him a taste of prosperity, after some adversity has afflicted
					him, he will say, "Troubles have gone away from me." He becomes excited and

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					Except those who are patient and do good deeds-these will have forgiveness and

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Perhaps you wish to disregard some of what is revealed to you, and you may be

					for all things.

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					But if they fail to answer you, know that it was revealed with God's knowledge,

				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					Is he who possesses a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him,

				-
			-
				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies about God? These will be

			-
				-
					And his people came rushing towards him-they were in the habit of committing

				Surah 11 - Hud: Ayah 101
			-

				-
					If only there were, among the generations before you, people with wisdom, who

					They said, "If the wolf ate him, and we are many, we would be good for
					nothing."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					So they went away with him, and agreed to put him at the bottom of the well.
					And We inspired him, "You will inform them of this deed of theirs when they are
					unaware."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					And they came to their father in the evening weeping.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					They said, "father, we went off racing one another, and left Joseph by our
					belongings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not believe us, even though we
					are being truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 18

					And they brought his shirt, with fake blood on it. He said, "Your souls enticed
					you to do something. But patience is beautiful, and God is my Help against what
					you describe."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					A caravan passed by, and they sent their water-carrier. He lowered his bucket,
					and said, "Good news. Here is a boy." And they hid him as merchandise. But God
					was aware of what they did.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					And they sold him for a cheap price-a few coins-they considered him to be of
					little value.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					The Egyptian who bought him said to his wife, "Take good care of him; he may be
					useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son." We thus established Joseph in the
					land, to teach him the interpretation of events. God has control over His
					affairs, but most people do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					When he reached his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward
					the righteous.

			-
				-
					She in whose house he was living tried to seduce him. She shut the doors, and
					said, "I am yours." He said, "God forbid! He is my Lord. He has given me a good
					home. Sinners never succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					She desired him, and he desired her, had he not seen the proof of his Lord. It
					was thus that We diverted evil and indecency away from him. He was one of Our
					loyal servants.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					As they raced towards the door, she tore his shirt from behind. At the door,
					they ran into her husband. She said, "What is the penalty for him who desired
					to dishonor your wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					He said, "It was she who tried to seduce me." A witness from her household
					suggested: "If his shirt is torn from the front: then she has told the truth,
					and he is the liar.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					But if his shirt is torn from the back: then she has lied, and he is the
					truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					And when he saw that his shirt was torn from the back, he said, "This is a
					woman's scheme. Your scheming is serious indeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					"Joseph, turn away from this. And you, woman, ask forgiveness for your sin; you
					are indeed in the wrong."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Some ladies in the city said, "The governor's wife is trying to seduce her
					servant. She is deeply in love with him. We see she has gone astray."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					And when she heard of their gossip, she invited them, and prepared for them a
					banquet, and she gave each one of them a knife. She said, "Come out before
					them." And when they saw him, they marveled at him, and cut their hands. They
					said, "Good God, this is not a human, this must be a precious angel."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					She said, "Here he is, the one you blamed me for. I did try to seduce him, but
					he resisted. But if he does not do what I tell him to do, he will be
					imprisoned, and will be one of the despised."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, prison is more desirable to me than what they call me to.
					Unless You turn their scheming away from me, I may yield to them, and become
					one of the ignorant."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Thereupon his Lord answered him, and diverted their scheming away from him. He
					is the Hearer, the Knower.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a
					while.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Two youth entered the prison with him. One of them said, "I see myself pressing
					wine." The other said, "I see myself carrying bread on my head, from which the
					birds are eating. Tell us their interpretation-we see that you are one of the
					righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					He said, "No food is served to you, but I have informed you about it before you
					have received it. That is some of what my Lord has taught me. I have forsaken
					the tradition of people who do not believe in God; and regarding the Hereafter,
					they are deniers."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					"And I have followed the faith of my forefathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and
					Jacob. It is not for us to associate anything with God. This is by virtue of
					God's grace upon us and upon the people, but most people do not give thanks.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					"My fellow inmates, are diverse lords better, or God, the One, the Supreme?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					"You do not worship, besides Him, except names you have named, you and your
					ancestors, for which God has sent down no authority. Judgment belongs to none
					but God. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. This is the right
					religion, but most people do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					"my fellow inmates! One of you will serve his master wine; while the other will
					be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. Thus the matter you are
					inquiring about is settled."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And he said to the one he thought would be released, "Mention me to your
					master." But Satan caused him to forget mentioning him to his master, so he
					remained in prison for several years.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					The king said, "I see seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and seven
					green spikes, and others dried up. O elders, explain to me my vision, if you
					are able to interpret visions."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					They said, "Jumbles of dreams, and we know nothing of the interpretation of
					dreams."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					The one who was released said, having remembered after a time, "I will inform
					you of its interpretation, so send me out."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					"Joseph, O man of truth, inform us concerning seven fat cows being eaten by
					seven lean ones, and seven green spikes, and others dried up, so that I may
					return to the people, so that they may know."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					He said, "You will farm for seven consecutive years. But whatever you harvest,
					leave it in its spikes, except for the little that you eat."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					Then after that will come seven difficult ones, which will consume what you
					have stored for them, except for the little that you have preserved.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Then after that will come a year that brings relief to the people, and during
					which they will press.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					The king said, "Bring him to me." And when the envoy came to him, he said, "Go
					back to your master, and ask him about the intentions of the women who cut
					their hands; my Lord is well aware of their schemes."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					He said, "What was the matter with you, women, when you tried to seduce
					Joseph?" They said, "God forbid! We knew of no evil committed by him." The
					governor's wife then said, "Now the truth is out. It was I who tried to seduce
					him, and he is telling the truth."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					"This is that he may know that I did not betray him in secret, and that God
					does not guide the scheming of the betrayers."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					"Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul commands evil, except those on
					whom my Lord has mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					The king said, "Bring him to me, and I will reserve him for myself." And when
					he spoke to him, he said, "This day you are with us established and secure."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					He said, "Put me in charge of the storehouses of the land; I am honest and
					knowledgeable."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					And thus We established Joseph in the land, to live therein wherever he wished.
					We touch with Our mercy whomever We will, and We never waste the reward of the
					righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					But the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and observed
					piety.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And Joseph's brothers came, and entered into his presence. He recognized them,
					but they did not recognize him.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					When he provided them with their provisions, he said, "Bring me a brother of
					yours from your father. Do you not see that I fill up the measure, and I am the
					best of hosts?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					"But if you do not bring him to me, you will have no measure from me, and you
					will not come near me."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					They said, "We will solicit him from his father. We will surely do."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					He said to his servants, "Put their goods in their saddlebags; perhaps they
					will recognize them when they return to their families, and maybe they will
					come back."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					When they returned to their father, they said, "father, we were denied measure,
					but send our brother with us, and we will obtain measure. We will take care of
					him."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					He said, "Shall I trust you with him, as I trusted you with his brother before?
					God is the Best Guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					And when they opened their baggage, they found that their goods were returned
					to them. They said, "Father, what more do we want? Here are our goods, returned
					to us. We will provide for our family, and protect our brother, and have an
					additional camel-load. This is easy commerce."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					He said, "I will not send him with you, unless you give me a pledge before God
					that you will bring him back to me, unless you get trapped." And when they gave
					him their pledge, he said, "God is witness to what we say."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					And he said, "my sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates.
					I cannot avail you anything against God. The decision rests only with God. On
					Him I rely, and on Him let the reliant rely."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					And when they entered as their father had instructed them, it did not avail
					them anything against God; it was just a need in the soul of Jacob, which he
					carried out. He was a person of knowledge inasmuch as We had taught him, but
					most people do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he embraced his brother, and
					said, "I am your brother; do not be saddened by what they used to do."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Then, when he provided them with their provisions, he placed the drinking-cup
					in his brother's saddlebag. Then an announcer called out, "people of the
					caravan, you are thieves."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					They said, as they came towards them, "What are you missing?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					They said, "We are missing the king's goblet. Whoever brings it will have a
					camel-load; and I personally guarantee it."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					They said, "By God, you know we did not come to cause trouble in the land, and
					we are not thieves."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					They said, "What shall be his punishment, if you are lying?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					They said, "His punishment, if it is found in his bag: he will belong to you.
					Thus we penalize the guilty."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					So he began with their bags, before his brother's bag. Then he pulled it out of
					his brother's bag. Thus We devised a plan for Joseph; he could not have
					detained his brother under the king's law, unless God so willed. We elevate by
					degrees whomever We will; and above every person of knowledge, there is one
					more learned.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					They said, "If he has stolen, a brother of his has stolen before." But Joseph
					kept it to himself, and did not reveal it to them. He said, "You are in a worse
					situation, and God is Aware of what you allege."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					They said, "noble prince, he has a father, a very old man, so take one of us in
					his place. We see that you are a good person."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					He said, "God forbid that we should arrest anyone except him in whose
					possession we found our property; for then we would be unjust."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And when they despaired of him, they conferred privately. Their eldest said,
					"Don't you know that your father received a pledge from you before God, and in
					the past you failed with regard to Joseph? I will not leave this land until my
					father permits me, or God decides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					"Go back to your father, and say, 'Our father, your son has stolen. We testify
					only to what we know, and we could not have prevented the unforeseen.'"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					"Ask the town where we were, and the caravan in which we came. We are being
					truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					He said, "Rather, your souls have contrived something for you. Patience is a
					virtue. Perhaps God will bring them all back to me. He is the Knowing, the
					Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Then he turned away from them, and said, "my bitterness for Joseph." And his
					eyes turned white from sorrow, and he became depressed.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					They said, "By God, you will not stop remembering Joseph, until you have ruined
					your health, or you have passed away."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					He said, "I only complain of my grief and sorrow to God, and I know from God
					what you do not know."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					"my sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of
					God's comfort. None despairs of God's comfort except the disbelieving people."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Then, when they entered into his presence, they said, "Mighty governor,
					adversity has befallen us, and our family. We have brought scant merchandise.
					But give us full measure, and be charitable towards us-God rewards the
					charitable."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					He said, "Do you realize what you did with Joseph and his brother, in your
					ignorance?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					They said, "Is that you, Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my
					brother. God has been gracious to us. He who practices piety and patience-God
					never fails to reward the righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					They said, "By God, God has preferred you over us. We were definitely in the
					wrong."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					He said, "There is no blame upon you today. God will forgive you. He is the
					Most Merciful of the merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					"Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my father's face, and he will recover
					his sight. And bring your whole family to me."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					As the caravan set out, their father said, "I sense the presence of Joseph,
					though you may think I am senile."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					They said, "By God, you are still in your old confusion."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Then, when the bearer of good news arrived, he laid it over his face, and he
					regained his sight. He said, "Did I not say to you that I know from God what
					you do not know?"
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					They said, "Father, pray for the forgiveness of our sins; we were indeed at
					fault."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					He said, "I will ask my Lord to forgive you. He is the Forgiver, the Most
					Merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Then, when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he embraced his parents,
					and said, "Enter Egypt, God willing, safe and secure."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					And he elevated his parents on the throne, and they fell prostrate before him.
					He said, "Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of long ago. My Lord has
					made it come true. He has blessed me, when he released me from prison, and
					brought you out of the wilderness, after the devil had sown conflict between me
					and my brothers. My Lord is Most Kind towards whomever He wills. He is the
					All-knowing, the Most Wise."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					"My Lord, You have given me some authority, and taught me some interpretation
					of events. Initiator of the heavens and the earth; You are my Protector in this
					life and in the Hereafter. Receive my soul in submission, and unite me with the
					righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					This is news from the past that We reveal to you. You were not present with
					them when they plotted and agreed on a plan.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					But most people, for all your eagerness, are not believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					You ask them no wage for it. It is only a reminder for all mankind.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					How many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they pass by, paying no
					attention to them?
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					And most of them do not believe in God unless they associate others.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Do they feel secure that a covering of God's punishment will not come upon
					them, or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly, while they are
					unaware?
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Say, "This is my way; I invite to God, based on clear knowledge-I and whoever
					follows me. Glory be to God; and I am not of the polytheists."
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					We did not send before you except men, whom We inspired, from the people of the
					towns. Have they not roamed the earth and seen the consequences for those
					before them? The Home of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous.
					Do you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					Until, when the messengers have despaired, and thought that they were rejected,
					Our help came to them. We save whomever We will, and Our severity is not
					averted from the guilty people.
				-
			-
				Surah 12 - Joseph: Ayah 111

					In their stories is a lesson for those who possess intelligence. This is not a

				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					God is He who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see, and then

				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 3

				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					Should you wonder-the real wonder is their saying: "When we have become dust,

					Fire, where they will remain forever.
				-

				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 6

			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					He has a succession; before him and behind him, protecting him by God's
					command. God does not change the condition of a people until they change what
					is within themselves. And if God wills any hardship for a people, there is no
					turning it back; and apart from Him they have no protector.

				-
					It is He who shows you the lightening, causing fear and hope. And He produces

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					The thunder praises His glory, and so do the angels, in awe of Him. And He
					sends the thunderbolts, striking with them whomever He wills. Yet they argue
					about God, while He is Tremendous in might.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					To Him belongs the call to truth. Those they call upon besides Him do not
					respond to them with anything-except as someone who stretches his hands towards
					water, so that it may reach his mouth, but it does not reach it. The prayers of
					the unbelievers are only in vain.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					To God prostrates everyone in the heavens and the earth, willingly or

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					Say, "Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "God." Say, "Have you
					taken besides Him protectors, who have no power to profit or harm even
					themselves?" Say, "Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or are darkness and
					light equal? Or have they assigned to God associates, who created the likes of
					His creation, so that the creations seemed to them alike? Say, "God is the
					Creator of all things, and He is The One, the Irresistible."
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					He sends down water from the sky, and riverbeds flow according to their
					capacity. The current carries swelling froth. And from what they heat in fire
					of ornaments or utensils comes a similar froth. Thus God exemplifies truth and
					falsehood. As for the froth, it is swept away, but what benefits the people
					remains in the ground. Thus God presents the analogies.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					For those who respond to their Lord is the best. But as for those who do not
					respond to Him, even if they possessed everything on earth, and twice as much,
					they could not redeem themselves with it. Those will have the worst reckoning;
					and their home is Hell-a miserable destination.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Is he who knows that what was revealed to your from your Lord is the truth,

			-
				-
					Those who fulfill the promise to God, and do not violate the agreement.
				-

			-
				-
					And those who join what God has commanded to be joined, and fear their Lord,

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					And those who patiently seek the presence of their Lord, and pray regularly,

					good. These will have the Ultimate Home.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					Everlasting Gardens, which they will enter, along with the righteous among

				-

			-
				-
					"Peace be upon you, because you endured patiently. How excellent is the Final

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					As for those who violate the promise to God, after pledging to keep it, and
					sever what God has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption on
					earth-these, the curse will be upon them, and they will have the Worst Home.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					God dispenses the provisions to whomever He wills, and restricts. And they
					delight in the worldly life; yet the worldly life, compared to the Hereafter,
					is only enjoyment.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve say, "If only a miracle was sent down to him from his

					whoever repents."
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of God.
					Surely, it is in the remembrance of God that hearts find comfort."
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					For those who believe and do righteous deeds-for them is happiness and a
					beautiful return.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Thus We sent you among a community before which other communities have passed
					away, that you may recite to them what We revealed to you. Yet they deny the
					Benevolent One. Say, "He is my Lord; there is no god but He; in Him I trust,
					and to Him is my repentance."
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Even if there were a Quran, by which mountains could be set in motion, or by
					which the earth could be shattered, or by which the dead could be made to
					speak. In fact, every decision rests with God. Did the believers not give up
					and realize that had God willed, He would have guided all humanity? Disasters
					will continue to strike those who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or they
					fall near their homes, until God's promise comes true. God never breaks a
					promise.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Messengers before you were ridiculed, but I granted the disbelievers respite,
					and then I seized them. What a punishment it was!
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Is He who is watchful over the deeds of every soul? Yet they ascribe associates
					to God. Say, "Name them! Or are you informing Him of something on earth He does
					not know, or is it a show of words?" In fact, the scheming of those who
					disbelieve is made to appear good to them, and they are averted from the path.
					Whomever God misguides has no guide.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					There is for them torment in the worldly life, but the torment of the Hereafter
					is harsher. And they have no defender against God.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					The likeness of the Garden promised to the righteous: rivers flowing beneath
					it; its food is perpetual, and so is its shade. Such is the sequel for those
					who guard against evil, but the sequel of the disbelievers is the Fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Those to whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in what was revealed to you, while
					some factions reject parts of it. Say, "I am commanded to worship God, and to
					never associate anything with Him. To Him I invite, and to Him is my return."
				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Thus We revealed it an Arabic code of law. Were you to follow their desires,

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 38
			-
				-

				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 41
			-

					Do they not see how We deal with the earth, diminishing it at its edges? God

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 42
			-

				-
			-
				Surah 13 - The Thunder: Ayah 43

				-
			-
				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					We never sent any messenger except in the language of his people, to make

				-

				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 5

			-
				-
					Moses said to his people, "Remember God's blessings upon you, as He delivered

				-
			-

					Has not the story reached you, of those before you, the people of Noah, and

				-
			-
				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Their messengers said, "Is there any doubt about God, Maker of the heavens and

				-
			-
				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 11
			-
				-

				-
			-
				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 22

					And Satan will say, when the issue is settled, "God has promised you the

					It yields its fruits every season by the will of its Lord. God presents the

					And the parable of a bad word is that of a bad tree-it is uprooted from the

				-
			-
				Surah 14 - Abraham: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					God gives firmness to those who believe, with the firm word, in this life, and

					And the jinn We created before, from piercing fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					Your Lord said to the angels, "I am creating a human being from clay, from
					molded mud."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					"When I have formed him, and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down
					prostrating before him."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					So the angels prostrated themselves, all together.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Except for Satan. He refused to be among those who prostrated themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					He said, "Satan, what kept you from being among those who prostrated
					themselves?"
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					He said, "I am not about to prostrate myself before a human being, whom You
					created from clay, from molded mud."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					He said, "Then get out of here, for you are an outcast".
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					"And the curse will be upon you until the Day of Judgment."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					He said, "You are of those reprieved."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					"Until the Day of the time appointed."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, since You have lured me away, I will glamorize for them on

				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					"Except for Your sincere servants among them."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					He said, "This is a right way with Me."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					"Over My servants you have no authority, except for the sinners who follow
					you."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And Hell is the meeting-place for them all.

			-
				-
					"It has seven doors; for each door is an assigned class."
				-

			-
				-
					"Enter it in peace and security."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And We will remove all ill-feelings from their hearts-brothers and sisters, on
					couches facing one another.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					No fatigue will ever touch them therein, nor will they be asked to leave it.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					And that My punishment is the painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					And inform them of the guests of Abraham.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					When they entered upon him, and said, "Peace." He said, "We are wary of you."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					They said, "Do not fear; we bring you good news of a boy endowed with
					knowledge."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					He said, "Do you bring me good news, when old age has overtaken me? What good
					news do you bring?"
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					They said, "We bring you good news in truth, so do not despair."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					He said, "And who despairs of his Lord's mercy but the lost?"
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					He said, "So what is your business, O envoys?"
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					They said, "We were sent to a sinful people."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					"Except for the family of Lot; we will save them all."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					"Except for his wife." We have determined that she will be of those who lag
					behind.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					And when the envoys came to the family of Lot.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					He said, "You are a people unknown to me."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					They said, "We bring you what they have doubts about."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					"We bring you the truth, and we are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					"Travel with your family at the dead of the night, and follow up behind them,
					and let none of you look back, and proceed as commanded."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					And We informed him of Our decree: the last remnant of these will be uprooted
					by early morning.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					And the people of the town came joyfully.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					He said, "These are my guests, so do not embarrass me."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					"And fear God, and do not disgrace me."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					They said, "Did we not forbid you from strangers?"
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					He said, "These are my daughters, if you must."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					By your life, they were blundering in their drunkenness.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					So the Blast struck them at sunrise.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					And We turned it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of baked clay.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Surely in that are lessons for those who read signs.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					And it is on an existing road.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Surely in that is a sign for the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					The people of the Woods were also wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					So We took revenge upon them. Both are clearly documented.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					The people of the Rock also rejected the messengers.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					We gave them Our revelations, but they turned away from them.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					They used to carve homes in the mountains, feeling secure.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					But the Blast struck them in the morning.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					All they had acquired was of no avail to them.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					We did not create the heavens and the earth, and what lies between them, except
					with truth. The Hour is coming, so forgive with gracious forgiveness.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Your Lord is the All-Knowing Creator.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					We have given you seven of the pairs, and the Grand Quran.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Do not extend your eyes towards what We have bestowed on some couples of them
					to enjoy, and do not grieve over them, and lower your wing to the believers.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					And say, "I am the clear warner."
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Just as We sent down to the separatists.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Those who made the Quran obsolete.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					By your Lord, we will question them all.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					About what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					So proclaim openly what you are commanded, and turn away from the polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					We are enough for you against the mockers.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Those who set up another god with God. They will come to know.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					We are aware that your heart is strained by what they say.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					So glorify the praise of your Lord, and be among those who bow down.
				-
			-
				Surah 15 - Al-Hijr: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					And worship your Lord in order to attain certainty.

			-
				-
					In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					The command of God has come, so do not rush it. Glory be to Him; exalted above
					what they associate.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command, upon whom He wills of
					His servants: "Give warning that there is no god but Me, and fear Me."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					He created the heavens and the earth with justice. He is exalted above the
					associations they attribute.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					He created the human being from a drop of fluid, yet he becomes an open
					adversary.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					And the livestock-He created them for you. In them are warmth and benefits for
					you, and of them you eat.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					And there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home, and when you
					drive them to pasture.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					And they carry your loads to territory you could not have reached without great
					hardship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					And the horses, and the mules, and the donkeys-for you to ride, and for luxury.
					And He creates what you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					It is for God to point out the paths, but some of them are flawed. Had He
					willed, He could have guided you all.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					It is He Who sends down for you from the sky water. From it is drink, and with
					it grows vegetation for grazing.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					And He produces for you grains with it, and olives, and date-palms, and grapes,
					and all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for people who think.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					And He regulated for you the night and the day; and the sun, and the moon, and
					the stars are disposed by His command. Surely in that are signs for people who
					ponder.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					And whatsoever He created for you on earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that
					is a sign for people who are mindful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And it is He who made the sea to serve you, that you may eat from it tender
					meat, and extract from it ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships
					plowing through it, as you seek His bounties, so that you may give thanks.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it shifts with you; and rivers, and
					roads, so that you may be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					And landmarks. And by the stars they guide themselves.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					Is He who creates like him who does not create? Will you not take a lesson?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					And if you tried to enumerate the favors of God, you will not be able to count
					them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					And God knows what you hide and what you disclose.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					Those they invoke besides God create nothing, but are themselves created.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					They are dead, not alive; and they do not know when they will be resurrected.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					Your God is one God. As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their
					hearts are in denial, and they are arrogant.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					Without a doubt, God knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He does not
					like the arrogant.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "What has your Lord sent down?" They say, "Legends
					of the ancients."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					So let them carry their loads complete on the Day of Resurrection, and some of
					the loads of those they misguided without knowledge. Evil is what they carry.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					Those before them also schemed, but God took their structures from the
					foundations, and the roof caved in on them. The punishment came at them from
					where they did not perceive.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them, and say, "Where are My
					associates for whose sake you used to dispute?" Those who were given knowledge
					will say, "Today shame and misery are upon the disbelievers."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					Those wronging their souls while the angels are taking them away-they will
					propose peace: "We did no wrong." Yes you did. God is aware of what you used to
					do."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein forever. Miserable is the residence
					of the arrogant.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					And it will be said to those who maintained piety, "What has your Lord
					revealed?" They will say, "Goodness." To those who do good in this world is
					goodness, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful is the
					residence of the pious.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow,
					where they will have whatever they desire. Thus God rewards the pious.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Those who are in a wholesome state when the angels take them-will say, "Peace
					be upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used to do."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Are they but waiting for the angels to come to them, or for the command of your
					Lord to arrive? Those before them did likewise. God did not wrong them, but
					they used to wrong their own souls.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					So the evils of their deeds assailed them, and what they used to ridicule
					engulfed them.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					The idolaters say, "Had God willed, we would not have worshiped anything
					besides Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor would we have prohibited
					anything besides His prohibitions." Those before them did likewise. Are the
					messengers responsible for anything but clear communication?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					To every community We sent a messenger: "Worship God, and avoid idolatry." Some
					of them God guided, while others deserved misguidance. So travel through the
					earth, and see what the fate of the deniers was.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Even though you may be concerned about their guidance, God does not guide those
					who misguide. And they will have no saviors.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And they swear by God with their most solemn oaths, "God will not resurrect
					anyone who dies." Yes indeed, it is a promise binding on Him, but most people
					do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					To clarify for them what they differed about, and for the faithless to know
					that they were liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					When We intend for something to happen, We say to it, "Be," and it becomes.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Those who emigrate for God's sake after being persecuted, We will settle them
					in a good place in this world; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if
					they only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Those who endure patiently, and in their Lord they put their trust.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					We did not send before you except men whom We inspired. So ask the people of
					knowledge, if you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					With the clarifications and the scriptures. And We revealed to you the
					Reminder, that you may clarify to the people what was revealed to them, and
					that they may reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Do those who scheme evils feel secure that God will not cause the earth to cave
					in with them, or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do
					not perceive?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Or that He will not seize them during their activities? And they will not be
					able to prevent it.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Or that He will not seize them while in dread? Your Lord is Gentle and
					Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					Have they not observed what God has created? Their shadows revolve from the
					right and the left, bowing to God as they shrink away.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					To God bows down everything in the heavens and everything on earth-every living
					creature, and the angels, and without being proud.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					God has said: "Do not take two gods; He is only One God; so fear only Me."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth; and to Him obedience is
					due always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than God?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Whatever blessing you have is from God. And when harm touches you, it is to Him
					that you groan.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					But when He lifts the harm from you, some of you associate others with their
					Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					To show ingratitude for what We have given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will
					soon know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					And they allocate, to something they do not know, a share of what We have
					provided for them. By God, you will be questioned about what you have been
					inventing.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					And they attribute to God daughters-exalted is He-and for themselves what they
					desire.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And when one of them is given news of a female infant, his face darkens, and he
					chokes with grief.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					He hides from the people because of the bad news given to him. Shall he keep it
					in humiliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the decision they make.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Those who do not believe in the Hereafter set a bad example, while God sets the
					Highest Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					If God were to hold mankind for their injustices, He would not leave upon it a
					single creature, but He postpones them until an appointed time. Then, when
					their time arrives, they will not delay it by one hour, nor will they advance
					it.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					And they attribute to God what they themselves dislike, while their tongues
					utter the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a doubt, for them is the
					Fire, and they will be neglected.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					By God, We sent messengers to communities before you, but Satan made their
					deeds appear alluring to them. He is their master today, and they will have a
					painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					We revealed to you the Scripture only to clarify for them what they differ
					about, and guidance and mercy for people who believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					God sends down water from the sky, with which He revives the earth after its
					death. In this is a sign for people who listen.

			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We give you a drink from their
					bellies, from between waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing to the drinkers.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					And from the fruits of date-palms and grapevines, you derive sugar and
					wholesome food. In this is a sign for people who understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					And your Lord inspired the bee: "Set up hives in the mountains, and in the
					trees, and in what they construct."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the pathways of your Lord, with
					precision. From their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, containing
					healing for the people. Surely in this is a sign for people who reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					God created you; then He takes you away. Some of you will be brought back to
					the worst age, so that he will no longer know anything, after having acquired
					knowledge. God is Omniscient and Omnipotent.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					God has favored some of you over others in livelihood. Those who are favored
					would not give their properties to their servants, to the extent of making them
					partners in it. Will they then renounce God's blessings?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					God has given you mates from among yourselves; and has produced for you, from
					your mates, children and grandchildren; and has provided you with good things.
					Will they then believe in falsehood, and refuse God's favors?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					And yet they serve besides God what possesses no provisions for them in the
					heavens, nor on earth, nor are they capable.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					So do not cite the examples for God. God knows, and you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					God cites the example of a bonded slave, who has no power over anything; and
					someone to whom We have given plentiful provision, from which he gives secretly
					and openly. Are they equal in comparison? All praise belongs to God, but most
					of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					And God cites the example of two men: one of them dumb, unable to do anything,
					and is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he achieves
					nothing good. Is he equal to him who commands justice, and is on a straight
					path?
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					To God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. The coming of the Hour
					is only as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. God has power over
					everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					God brought you out of your mothers' wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 79

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And God has given you in your homes habitats for you, and has provided for you
					out of the hides of livestock portable homes for you, so you can use them when
					you travel, and when you camp; and from their wool, and fur, and hair,
					furnishings and comfort for a while.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And God has made for you shade out of what He has created, and has given you
					resorts in the mountains, and has given you garments to protect you from the
					heat, and garments to protect you from your violence. Thus He completes His
					blessings upon you, so that you may submit.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					But if they turn away, your only duty is clear communication.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					They recognize God's blessing, but then deny it, as most of them are
					ungrateful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					On the Day when We raise up a witness from every community-those who
					disbelieved will not be permitted, nor will they be excused.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					When those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them,
					nor will they be reprieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					And when the idolaters see their associates, they will say, "Our Lord, these
					are our associates whom we used to invoke besides You." They will strike back
					at them with the saying, "Surely you are liars."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					On that Day they will offer their submission to God, and what they had invented
					will abandon them.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve and obstruct from God's path-We will add punishment to
					their punishment, on account of the mischief they used to make.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					On the Day when We raise in every community a witness against them, from among
					them, and bring you as a witness against these. We have revealed to you the
					Book, as an explanation of all things, and guidance, and mercy and good news
					for those who submit.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					God commands justice, and goodness, and generosity towards relatives. And He
					forbids immorality, and injustice, and oppression. He advises you, so that you
					may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Fulfill God's covenant when you make a covenant, and do not break your oaths
					after ratifying them. You have made God your guarantor, and God knows what you
					do.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					And do not be like her who unravels her yarn, breaking it into pieces, after
					she has spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means of deception among you,
					because one community is more prosperous than another. God is testing you
					thereby. On the Day of Resurrection, He will make clear to you everything you
					had disputed about.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Had God willed, He would have made you one congregation, but He leaves astray
					whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned
					about what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					And do not use your oaths to deceive one another, so that a foot may not slip
					after being firm, and you taste misery because you hindered from God's path,
					and incur a terrible torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					And do not exchange God's covenant for a small price. What is with God is
					better for you, if you only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					What you have runs out, but what is with God remains. We will reward those who

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while being a believer, We

			-
				-
					He has no authority over those who believe and trust in their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					His authority is only over those who follow him, and those who associate others
					with Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					When We substitute a verse in place of another verse-and God knows best what He

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Say, "The Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord, truthfully, in order

					submit."
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					We are well aware that they say, "It is a human being who is teaching him." But
					the tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while this is a clear Arabic
					tongue.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					Those who do not believe in God's revelations-God will not guide them, and for

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					It is those who do not believe in God's revelations who fabricate falsehood.
					These are the liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					Whoever renounces faith in God after having believed-except for someone who is
					compelled, while his heart rests securely in faith-but whoever willingly opens
					up his heart to disbelief-upon them falls wrath from God, and for them is a
					tremendous torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					That is because they have preferred the worldly life to the Hereafter, and
					because God does not guide the people who refuse.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					It is they whom God has sealed their hearts, and their hearing, and their

				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					There is no doubt that in the Hereafter they will be the losers.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					But then your Lord-for those who emigrated after being persecuted, then
					struggled and persevered-your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					And God cites the example of a town that was secure and peaceful, with its
					livelihood coming to it abundantly from every direction. But then it turned
					unappreciative of God's blessings, so God made it taste the robe of hunger and
					fear, because of what they used to craft.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					A messenger from among them had come to them, but they denounced him, so the

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					Eat of the lawful and good things God has provided for you, and be thankful for

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and anything

					being deliberate or malicious, then God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					And do not say of falsehood asserted by your tongues, "This is lawful, and this

					invent lies and attribute them to God will not succeed.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					A brief enjoyment-then they will have a painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					For those who are Jews, We have prohibited what We related to you before. We

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					But towards those who do wrongs in ignorance, and then repent afterwards and
					reform, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					Abraham was an exemplary leader, devoted to God, a monotheist, and was not of
					the polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					Thankful for His blessings. He chose him, and guided him to a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					And We gave him goodness in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					Then We inspired you: "Follow the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					The Sabbath was decreed only for those who differed about it. Your Lord will

				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good advice, and debate with

					His path, and He is aware of those who are guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the same degree as the injury done to
					you. But if you resort to patience-it is better for the patient.
				-
			-
				Surah 16 - The Bee: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					So be patient. Your patience is solely from God. And do not grieve over them,

				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					When the first of the two promises came true, We sent against you servants of

				-
			-

			-
				-
					Then We gave you back your turn against them, and supplied you with wealth and

				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					If you work righteousness, you work righteousness for yourselves; and if you

			-
				-
					We have made the night and the day two wonders. We erased the wonder of the

				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan sows discord among them. Satan is
					to man an open enemy.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will have mercy on you; and if He
					wills, He will punish you. We did not send you as their advocate.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Your Lord knows well everyone in the heavens and the earth. We have given some
					prophets advantage over others; and to David We gave the Psalms.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Say, "Call upon those you claim besides Him. They have no power to relieve your
					adversity, nor can they change it."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Those they call upon are themselves seeking means of access to their Lord,
					vying to be nearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fearing His punishment. The
					punishment of your Lord is to be dreaded.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					There is no city but We will destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or punish
					it with a severe punishment. This is inscribed in the Book.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Nothing prevents Us from sending miraculous signs, except that the ancients
					called them lies. We gave Thamood the she-camel, a visible sign, but they
					mistreated her. We do not send the signs except to instill reverence.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					We said to you that your Lord encompasses humanity. We did not make the vision
					We showed you, except as a test for the people, and the tree cursed in the
					Quran. We frighten them, but that only increases their defiance.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					When We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," they bowed down, except for
					Satan. He said, "Shall I bow down before someone You created from mud?"
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					He said, "Do You see this one whom You have honored more than me? If You
					reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his descendants under
					my sway, except for a few."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					He said, "Begone! Whoever of them follows you-Hell is your reward, an ample
					reward."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					"And entice whomever of them you can with your voice, and rally against them
					your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and
					make promises to them." But Satan promises them nothing but delusion.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					"As for My devotees, you have no authority over them." Your Lord is an adequate
					Guardian.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Your Lord is He who propels for you the ships at sea, that you may seek of His
					bounty. He is towards you Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					When harm afflicts you at sea, those you pray to vanish, except for Him. But
					when He saves you to land, you turn away. The human being is ever thankless.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Are you confident that He will not cause a track of land to cave in beneath
					you, or unleash a tornado against you, and then you find no protector?
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Or are you confident that He will not return you to it once again, and unleash
					a hurricane against you, and drown you for your ingratitude? Then you will find
					no helper against Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					We have honored the Children of Adam, and carried them on land and sea, and
					provided them with good things, and greatly favored them over many of those We
					created.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					On the Day when We call every people with their leader. Whoever is given his
					record in his right hand-these will read their record, and they will not be
					wronged one bit.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					But whoever is blind in this, he will be blind in the Hereafter, and further
					astray from the way.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					They almost lured you away from what We have revealed to you, so that you would
					invent something else in Our name. In that case, they would have taken you for
					a friend.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Had We not given you stability, you might have inclined towards them a little.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Then We would have made you taste double in life, and double at death; then you
					would have found for yourself no helper against Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					They almost provoked you, to expel you from the land. In that case, they would
					not have lasted after you, except briefly.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					The tradition of the messengers We sent before you-you will find no change in
					Our rules.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Perform the prayer at the decline of the sun, until the darkness of the night;
					and the Quran at dawn. The Quran at dawn is witnessed.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					And keep vigil with it during parts of the night, as an extra prayer. Perhaps
					your Lord will raise you to a laudable position.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And say, "My Lord, lead me in through an entry of truth, and lead me out
					through an exit of truth, and grant me from You a supporting power."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And say, "The truth has come, and falsehood has withered away; for falsehood is
					bound to wither away."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					We send down in the Quran healing and mercy for the believers, but it increases
					the wrongdoers only in loss.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					When We bless the human being, he turns away and distances himself. But when
					adversity touches him, he is in despair.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Say, "Each does according to his disposition. Your Lord knows best who is
					better guided in the way."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, "The Spirit belongs to the domain of my
					Lord; and you were given only little knowledge."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					If We willed, We could take away what We revealed to you. Then you will find
					for yourself no protecting guardian against Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					Except through a mercy from your Lord. His favors upon you have been great.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Say, "If mankind and jinn came together to produce the like of this Quran, they
					could never produce the like of it, even if they backed up one another."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					We have displayed for mankind in this Quran every kind of similitude, but most
					people insist on denying the truth.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					And they said, "We will not believe in you unless you make a spring burst from
					the ground for us.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Or you have a garden of palms and vines; then cause rivers to gush pouring
					through them.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you claim, or bring God and the angels
					before us.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Or you possess a house of gold. Or you ascend into the sky. Even then, we will
					not believe in your ascension, unless you bring down for us a book that we can
					read." Say, "Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a human messenger?"
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					Nothing prevented the people from believing, when guidance has come to them,
					except that they said, "Did God send a human messenger?"
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					Say, "If there were angels on earth, walking around in peace, We would have
					sent down to them from heaven an angel messenger."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Say, "God is enough witness between you and me. He is fully aware of His
					servants, and He sees them well."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					Whomever God guides is the guided one. And whomever He leaves astray-for them
					you will find no protectors apart from Him. And We will gather them on the Day
					of Resurrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf. Their abode is Hell;
					whenever it abates, We intensify the blaze for them.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					This is their repayment for having blasphemed against Our revelations, and
					having said, "Shall we, when we have become bones and fragments, be resurrected
					as a new creation?"
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Do they not consider that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, is Able
					to create the likes of them? He has assigned for them a term, in which there is
					no doubt. But the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Say, "If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord's mercy, you would have
					withheld them for fear of spending." The human being has always been stingy.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					We gave Moses nine clear signs-ask the Children of Israel. When he went to
					them, Pharaoh said to him, "I think that you, Moses, are bewitched."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					He said, "You know that none sent these down except the Lord of the heavens and
					the earth-eye openers; and I think that you, Pharaoh, are doomed."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					He resolved to scare them off the land, but We drowned him, and those with him,
					altogether.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					After him, We said to the Children of Israel, "Inhabit the land, and when the
					promise of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all together."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					With the truth We sent it down, and with the truth it descended. We sent you
					only as a bearer of good news and a warner.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					A Quran which We unfolded gradually, that you may recite to the people over
					time. And We revealed it in stages.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Say, "Believe in it, or do not believe." Those who were given knowledge before
					it, when it is recited to them, they fall to their chins, prostrating.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					And they say, "Glory to our Lord. The promise of our Lord is fulfilled."
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					And they fall to their chins, weeping, and it adds to their humility.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					Say, "Call Him God, or call Him the Most Merciful. Whichever name you use, to
					Him belong the Best Names." And be neither loud in your prayer, nor silent in
					it, but follow a course in between.
				-
			-
				Surah 17 - Israel: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					And say, "Praise be to God, who has not begotten a son, nor has He a partner in
					sovereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, and glorify Him constantly."
				-
		-
			Surah 18 - The Cave
		-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 0
			-
				-
					In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					Praise be to God, who revealed the Book to His servant, and allowed in it no
					distortion.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					Valuable-to warn of severe punishment from Himself; and to deliver good news to
					the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have an excellent reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					In which they will abide forever.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					And to warn those who say, "God has begotten a son."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. Grave is the word
					that comes out of their mouths. They say nothing but a lie.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					Perhaps you may destroy yourself with grief, chasing after them, if they do not
					believe in this information.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					We made what is upon the earth an ornament for it, to test them as to which of
					them is best in conduct.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					And We will turn what is on it into barren waste.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Did you know that the People of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our
					wondrous signs?
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					When the youths took shelter in the cave, they said, "Our Lord, give us mercy
					from Yourself, and bless our affair with guidance."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Then We awakened them to know which of the two groups could better calculate
					the length of their stay.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					We relate to you their story in truth. They were youths who believed in their
					Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And We strengthened their hearts, when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the
					Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will not call on any god besides Him, for
					then we would have spoken an outrage."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					"These people, our people, have taken to themselves gods other than Him. Why do
					they not bring a clear proof concerning them? Who, then, does greater wrong
					than he who invents lies and attributes them to God?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					"Now that you have withdrawn from them, and from what they worship besides God,
					take shelter in the cave. And your Lord will unfold His mercy for you, and will
					set your affair towards ease."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					You would have seen the sun, when it rose, veering away from their cave towards
					the right, and when it sets, moving away from them to the left, as they lay in
					the midst of the cave. That was one of God's wonders. He whom God guides is
					truly guided; but he whom He misguides, for him you will find no directing
					friend.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					You would think them awake, although they were asleep. And We turned them over
					to the right, and to the left, with their dog stretching its paws across the
					threshold. Had you looked at them, you would have turned away from them in
					flight, and been filled with fear of them.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Even so, We awakened them, so that they may ask one another. A speaker among
					them said, "How long have you stayed?" They said, "We have stayed a day, or
					part of a day." They said, "Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed."
					"Send one of you to the city, with this money of yours, and let him see which
					food is most suitable, and let him bring you some provision thereof. And let
					him be gentle, and let no one become aware of you."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					"If they discover you, they will stone you, or force you back into their
					religion; then you will never be saved."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					So it was, that We caused them to be discovered, that they would know that the
					promise of God is true, and that of the Hour there is no doubt. As they were
					disputing their case among themselves, they said, "Build over them a building."
					Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed over their case said, "We
					will set up over them a place of worship."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					They will say, "Three, and their fourth being their dog." And they will say,
					"Five, and their sixth being their dog," guessing at the unknown. And they will
					say, "Seven, and their eighth being their dog." Say, "My Lord knows best their
					number." None knows them except a few. So do not argue concerning them except
					with an obvious argument, and do not consult any of them about them.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					And never say about anything, "I will do that tomorrow."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					Without saying, "If God wills." And remember your Lord if you forget, and say,
					"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer than this in integrity."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					And they stayed in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					Say, "God knows best how long they stayed." His is the mystery of the heavens
					and the earth. By Him you see and hear. They have no guardian apart from Him,
					and He shares His Sovereignty with no one.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					And recite what was revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. There is no
					changing His words, and you will find no refuge except in Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					And content yourself with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening,
					desiring His Presence. And do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the
					glitter of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made heedless of
					Our remembrance-so he follows his own desires-and his priorities are confused.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					And say, "The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills-let him believe. And
					whoever wills-let him disbelieve". We have prepared for the unjust a Fire,
					whose curtains will hem them in. And when they cry for relief, they will be
					relieved with water like molten brass, which scalds the faces. What a miserable
					drink, and what a terrible place.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					As for those who believe and lead a righteous life-We will not waste the reward
					of those who work righteousness.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					These will have the Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow. Reclining on
					comfortable furnishings, they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and will
					wear green garments of silk and brocade. What a wonderful reward, and what an
					excellent resting-place.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					And cite for them the parable of two men. To one of them We gave two gardens of
					vine, and We surrounded them with palm-trees, and We placed between them crops.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Both gardens produced their harvest in full, and suffered no loss. And We made
					a river flow through them.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And thus he had abundant fruits. He said to his friend, as he conversed with
					him, "I am wealthier than you, and greater in manpower."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					And he entered his garden, wronging himself. He said, "I do not think this will
					ever perish."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					"And I do not think the Hour is coming. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I
					will find something better than this in return."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					His friend said to him, as he conversed with him, "Are you being ungrateful to
					Him who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then evolved you into a
					man?
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					But as for me, He is God, my Lord, and I never associate with my Lord anyone.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					When you entered your garden, why did you not say, "As God wills; there is no
					power except through God"? Although you see me inferior to you in wealth and
					children.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Perhaps my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and release
					upon it thunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes barren waste.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Or its water will sink into the ground, and you will be unable to draw it."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he began wringing his hands over what
					he had invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. And he was saying,
					"I wish I never associated anyone with my Lord."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					He had no faction to help him besides God, and he was helpless.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					That is because authority belongs to God, the True. He is Best in rewarding,
					and Best in requiting.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And cite for them the parable of the present life: it is like water that We
					send down from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it; but then it becomes
					debris, scattered by the wind. God has absolute power over everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Wealth and children are the adornments of the present life. But the things that
					last, the virtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for reward, and better for
					hope.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					On the Day when We set the mountains in motion; and you see the earth emerging;
					and We gather them together, and leave none of them behind.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					They will be presented before your Lord in a row. "You have come to Us as We
					created you the first time. Although you claimed We would not set a meeting for
					you."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And the book will be placed, and you will see the sinners fearful of its
					contents. And they will say, "Woe to us! What is with this book that leaves
					nothing, small or big, but it has enumerated it?" They will find everything
					they had done present. Your Lord does not wrong anyone.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam." So they bowed down, except for
					Satan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the command of his Lord. Will you take
					him and his offspring as lords instead of Me, when they are an enemy to you?
					Evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor
					their own creation; and I do not take the misleaders for assistants.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					On the Day when He will say, "Call on My partners whom you have claimed." They
					will call on them, but they will not answer them. And We will place between
					them a barrier.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					And the sinners will see the Fire, and will realize that they will tumble into
					it. They will find no deliverance from it.

				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					We have elaborated in this Quran for the people every kind of example, but the
					human being is a most argumentative being.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					What prevented people from accepting faith, when guidance has come to them, and
					from seeking their Lord's forgiveness? Unless they are waiting for the
					precedent of the ancients to befall them, or to have the punishment come upon
					them face to face.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					We send the messengers only as deliverers of good news and warners. Those who
					disbelieve argue with false argument, in order to defeat the truth thereby.
					They take My Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Who does greater wrong than he, who, when reminded of his Lord's revelations,
					turns away from them, and forgets what his hands have put forward? We have
					placed coverings over their hearts, lest they understand it, and heaviness in
					their ears. And if you call them to guidance, they will not be guided, ever.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Your Lord is the Forgiver, Possessor of Mercy. Were He to call them to account
					for what they have earned, He would have hastened the punishment for them. But
					they have an appointment from which they will find no escape.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					And these towns-We destroyed them when they committed injustices, and We set
					for their destruction an appointed time.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Recall when Moses said to his servant, "I will not give up until I reach the
					junction of the two rivers, even if it takes me years."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					Then, when they reached the junction between them, they forgot about their
					fish. It found its way into the river, slipping away.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					When they went further, he said to his servant, "Bring us our lunch; we were
					exposed in our travel to much fatigue."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					He said, "Do you remember when we rested by the rock? I forgot about the fish.
					It was only the devil who made me forget it. And so it found its way to the
					river, amazingly."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					He said, "This is what we were seeking." And so they turned back retracing
					their steps.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Then they came upon a servant of Ours, whom We had blessed with mercy from Us,
					and had taught him knowledge from Our Own.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Moses said to him, "May I follow you, so that you may teach me some of the
					guidance you were taught?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					He said, "You will not be able to endure with me.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					And how will you endure what you have no knowledge of?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					He said, "You will find me, God willing, patient; and I will not disobey you in
					any order of yours."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					He said, "If you follow me, do not ask me about anything, until I myself make
					mention of it to you."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					So they set out. Until, when they had boarded the boat, he holed it. He said,
					"Did you hole it, to drown its passengers? You have done something awful."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					He said, "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					He said, "Do not rebuke me for forgetting, and do not make my course difficult
					for me."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Then they set out. Until, when they encountered a boy, he killed him. He said,
					"Did you kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You have done something
					terrible."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					He said, "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					He said, "If I ask you about anything after this, then do not keep company with
					me. You have received excuses from me."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					So they set out. Until, when they reached the people of a town, they asked them
					for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. There they found a wall
					about to collapse, and he repaired it. He said, "If you wanted, you could have
					obtained a payment for it."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					He said, "This is the parting between you and me. I will tell you the
					interpretation of what you were unable to endure.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					As for the boat, it belonged to paupers working at sea. I wanted to damage it
					because there was a king coming after them seizing every boat by force.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					As for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared he would overwhelm
					them with oppression and disbelief.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					So we wanted their Lord to replace him with someone better in purity, and
					closer to mercy.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the town. Beneath it
					was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man. Your
					Lord wanted them to reach their maturity, and then extract their treasure-as a
					mercy from your Lord. I did not do it of my own accord. This is the
					interpretation of what you were unable to endure."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, "I will tell you something about him."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					We established him on earth, and gave him all kinds of means.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					He pursued a certain course.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a murky
					spring, and found a people in its vicinity. We said, "Zul-Qarnain, you may
					either inflict a penalty, or else treat them kindly."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					He said, "As for him who does wrong, we will penalize him, then he will be
					returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with an unheard-of torment.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					"But as for him who believes and acts righteously, he will have the finest
					reward, and We will speak to him of Our command with ease."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					Then he pursued a course.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Until, when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people
					for whom We had provided no shelter from it.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					And so it was. We had full knowledge of what he had.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					Then he pursued a course.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Until, when he reached the point separating the two barriers, he found beside
					them a people who could barely understand what is said.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					They said, "Zul-Qarnain, the Gog and Magog are spreading chaos in the land. Can
					we pay you, to build between us and them a wall?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					He said, "What my Lord has empowered me with is better. But assist me with
					strength, and I will build between you and them a dam."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					"Bring me blocks of iron." So that, when he had leveled up between the two
					cliffs, he said, "Blow." And having turned it into a fire, he said, "Bring me
					tar to pour over it."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					So they were unable to climb it, and they could not penetrate it.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					He said, "This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes
					true, He will turn it into rubble, and the promise of my Lord is always true."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					On that Day, We will leave them surging upon one another. And the Trumpet will
					be blown, and We will gather them together.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					On that Day, We will present the disbelievers to Hell, all displayed.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					Those whose eyes were screened to My message, and were unable to hear.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants for masters
					instead of Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of the faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Say, "Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in their works?"
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					"Those whose efforts in this world are misguided, while they assume that they
					are doing well."
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					It is they who rejected the communications of their Lord, and the encounter
					with Him. So their works are in vain. And on the Day of Resurrection, We will
					consider them of no weight.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					That is their requital-Hell-on account of their disbelief, and their taking My
					revelations and My messengers in mockery.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will have the Gardens of
					Paradise for hospitality.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					Abiding therein forever, without desiring any change therefrom.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					Say, "If the ocean were ink for the words of my Lord, the ocean would run out,
					before the words of my Lord run out," even if We were to bring the like of it
					in addition to it.
				-
			-
				Surah 18 - The Cave: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					Say, "I am only a human being like you, being inspired that your god is One
					God. Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and never
					associate anyone with the service of his Lord."

					A mention of the mercy of your Lord towards His servant Zechariah.

			-
				-
					When he called on his Lord, a call in seclusion.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 4

				-
					He said, "My Lord, my bones have become feeble, and my hair is aflame with

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, how can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have
					become decrepit with old age?"
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					He said, "It will be so, your Lord says, 'it is easy for me, and I created you
					before, when you were nothing.'"
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, give me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you will not

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					And he came out to his people, from the sanctuary, and signaled to them to

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					"John, hold on to the Scripture firmly," and We gave him wisdom in his youth.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					And tenderness from Us, and innocence. He was devout.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And kind to his parents; and he was not a disobedient tyrant.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					And mention in the Scripture Mary, when she withdrew from her people to an
					eastern location.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					She screened herself away from them, and We sent to her Our spirit, and He

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					She said, "I take refuge from you in the Most Merciful, should you be
					righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord, to give you the gift of a pure

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					She said, "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I was never

				-
			-

			-
				-
					He said, "Thus said your Lord, `It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					So she carried him, and secluded herself with him in a remote place.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					The labor-pains came upon her, by the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, "I wish I

				-
			-

			-
				-
					Whereupon he called her from beneath her: "Do not worry; your Lord has placed a

					"So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if you see any human, say, 'I have

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Then she came to her people, carrying him. They said, "Mary, you have done

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					O sister of Aaron, your father was not an evil man, and your mother was not a

				-
					So she pointed to him. They said, "How can we speak to an infant in the crib?"
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					He said, "I am the servant of God. He has given me the Scripture, and made me a

			-
				-
					And kind to my mother, and He did not make me a disobedient rebel.

			-
				-
					So Peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the Day I get

			-
				-
					That is Jesus son of Mary-the Word of truth about which they doubt.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					It is not for God to have a child-glory be to Him. To have anything done, He

				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					"God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path."

					But the various factions differed among themselves. So woe to those who

			-
				-
					Listen to them and watch for them the Day they come to Us. But the wrongdoers

					It is We who will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and to Us they will be

					And mention in the Scripture Abraham. He was a man of truth, a prophet.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					He said to his father, "my father, why do you worship what can neither hear,

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					O my father, there has come to me knowledge that never came to you. So follow

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					O my father, do not worship the devil. The devil is disobedient to the Most

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					O my father, I fear that a punishment from the Most Gracious will afflict you,

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 46
			-

			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 47
			-
				-

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And I will withdraw from you, and from what you pray to instead of God. And I

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					When he withdrew from them, and from what they worship besides God, We granted

				-
					And We granted him, out of Our mercy, his brother Aaron, a prophet.

					And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He was true to his promise, and was a

			-
				-
					And We raised him to a high position.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					These are some of the prophets God has blessed, from the descendants of Adam,
					and from those We carried with Noah, and from the descendants of Abraham and
					Israel, and from those We guided and selected. Whenever the revelations of the
					Most Gracious are recited to them, they would fall down, prostrating and
					weeping.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					But they were succeeded by generations who lost the prayers and followed their

				-
			-

					Except for those who repent, and believe, and act righteously. These will enter

				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. So worship Him, and
					persevere in His service. Do you know of anyone equal to Him?
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					And the human being says, "When I am dead, will I be brought back alive?"
				-
			-

					Does the human being not remember that We created him before, when he was

					By your Lord, We will round them up, and the devils, then We will bring them

					Then, out of every sect, We will snatch those most defiant to the Most

					There is not one of you but will go down to it. This has been an unavoidable

				-

				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					Then We will rescue those who were devout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on
					their knees.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to
					those who believe, "Which of the two parties is better in position, and
					superior in influence?"
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who surpassed them in
					riches and splendor?
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Say, "Whoever is in error, the Most Merciful will lead him on." Until, when
					they see what they were promised-either the punishment, or the Hour. Then they
					will know who was in worse position and weaker in forces.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					God increases in guidance those who accept guidance. And the things that
					endure-the righteous deeds-have the best reward with your Lord, and the best
					outcome.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Have you seen him who denied Our revelations, and said, "I will be given wealth
					and children"?
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Did he look into the future, or did he receive a promise from the Most
					Merciful?
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					No indeed! We will write what he says, and will keep extending the agony for
					him.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					Then We will inherit from him what he speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And they took, besides God, other gods, to be for them a source of strength.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					By no means! They will reject their worship of them, and become opponents to
					them.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					Have you not considered how We dispatch the devils against the disbelievers,
					exciting them with incitement?
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					So do not hurry against them. We are counting for them a countdown.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					On the Day when We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful, as guests.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					And herd the sinners into hell, like animals to water.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					They will have no power of intercession, except for someone who has an
					agreement with the Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					And they say, "The Most Merciful has begotten a son."
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					You have come up with something monstrous.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					At which the heavens almost rupture, and the earth splits, and the mountains
					fall and crumble.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					Because they attribute a son to the Most Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to have a son.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					There is none in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Most Merciful
					as a servant.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					He has enumerated them, and counted them one by one.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Those who believe and do righteous deeds, the Most Merciful will give them
					love.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					We made it easy in your tongue, in order to deliver good news to the righteous,
					and to warn with it a hostile people.
				-
			-
				Surah 19 - Mary: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					How many a generation have We destroyed before them? Can you feel a single one
					of them, or hear from them the slightest whisper?

					A revelation from He who created the earth and the high heavens.

					Has the story of Moses reached you?
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					When he saw a fire, he said to his family, "Stay; I have noticed a fire;
					Perhaps I can bring you a torch therefrom, or find some guidance by the fire."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					Then, when he reached it, he was called, "Moses.

				-
					I-I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.

					I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed.

				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					The Hour is coming-but I keep it almost hidden-so that each soul will be paid

				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					And do not let him who denies it and follows his desire turn you away from it,

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And what is that in your right-hand, O Moses?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					He said, "This is my staff. I lean on it, and herd my sheep with it, and I have
					other uses for it."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					He said, "Throw it, O Moses."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					So he threw it-thereupon it became a moving serpent.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					He said, "Take hold of it, and do not fear. We will restore it to its original
					condition.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					And press your hand to your side; it will come out white, without a

				-
					That We may show you some of Our greatest signs.

					Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed."
				-
			-

				-
					He said, "My Lord, put my heart at peace for me.

			-
				-
					We had favored you another time.
				-
			-

				-
					When We inspired your mother with the inspiration.

			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					`Put him in the chest; then cast him into the river. The river will wash him to

					bestowed upon you love from Me, so that you may be reared before My eye.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					When your sister walked along, and said, 'Shall I tell you about someone who
					will take care of him?' So We returned you to your mother, that she may be
					comforted, and not sorrow. And you killed a person, but We saved you from
					stress; and We tested you thoroughly. And you stayed years among the people of
					Median. Then you came back, as ordained, O Moses.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 41

				-
					And I made you for Myself.

					Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not neglect My remembrance.

			-
				-
					Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will remember, or have some fear."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					They said, "Lord, we fear he may persecute us, or become violent."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					He said, "Do not fear, I am with you, I hear and I see.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Approach him and say, `We are the messengers of your Lord; so let the Children

				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 48

					It was revealed to us that the punishment falls upon him who disbelieves and

					He said, "Our Lord is He who gave everything its existence, then guided it."

			-
				-
					He said, "What about the first generations?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 52

				-
					He said, "Knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor

				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					He who made the earth a habitat for you; and traced in it routes for you; and

			-
				-
					We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					He said, "Did you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O
					Moses?
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					We will produce for you magic like it; so make an appointment between us and
					you, which we will not miss-neither us, nor you-in a central place."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					He said, "Your appointment is the day of the festival, so let the people be
					gathered together at mid-morning."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Pharaoh turned away, put together his plan, and then came back.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					Moses said to them, "Woe to you. Do not fabricate lies against God, or He will
					destroy you with a punishment. He who invents lies will fail."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					They disagreed among themselves over their affair, and conferred secretly.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					They said, "These two are magicians who want to drive you out of your land with
					their magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of life.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					So settle your plan, and come as one front. Today, whoever gains the upper hand
					will succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					They said, "Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					He said, "You throw." And suddenly, their ropes and sticks appeared to him,
					because of their magic, to be crawling swiftly.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					We said, "Do not be afraid, you are the uppermost.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Now throw down what is in your right hand-it will swallow what they have
					crafted. What they have crafted is only a magician's trickery. But the magician
					will not succeed, no matter what he does."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					And the magicians fell down prostrate. They said, "We have believed in the Lord
					of Aaron and Moses."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					He said, "Did you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be
					your chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off your hands and your feet
					on alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees.
					Then you will know which of us is more severe in punishment, and more lasting."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					They said, "We will not prefer you to the proofs that have come to us, and Him
					who created us. So issue whatever judgment you wish to issue. You can only rule
					in this lowly life.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					We have believed in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins, and the magic
					you have compelled us to practice. God is Better, and more Lasting."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor
					lives.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					But whoever comes to Him a believer, having worked righteousness-these will
					have the highest ranks.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever.
					That is the reward for him who purifies himself.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					And We inspired Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, and strike for them a
					dry path across the sea, not fearing being overtaken, nor worrying."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but the sea overwhelmed them, and
					completely engulfed them.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Pharaoh misled his people, and did not guide them.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					O Children of Israel! We have delivered you from your enemy, and promised you
					by the right side of the Mount, and sent down to you manna and quails.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Eat of the good things We have provided for you, but do not be excessive
					therein, lest My wrath descends upon you. He upon whom My wrath descends has
					fallen.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					And I am Forgiving towards him who repents, believes, acts righteously, and
					then remains guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					"And what made you rush ahead of your people, O Moses?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					He said, "They are following in my footsteps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord,
					that you may be pleased."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					He said, "We have tested your people in your absence, and the Samarian misled
					them."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					So Moses returned to his people, angry and disappointed. He said, "my people,
					did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Was the time too long for you? Or
					did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon you, so you broke your
					promise to me?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our choice, but we were made
					to carry loads of the people's ornaments, and we cast them in. That was what
					the Samarian suggested."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					So he produced for them a calf-a mere body which lowed. And they said, "This is
					your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					Did they not see that it cannot return a word to them, and has no power to harm
					them or benefit them?
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					Aaron had said to them before, "my people, you are being tested by this. And
					your Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey my command."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					They said, "We will not give up our devotion to it, until Moses returns to us."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					He said, "Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					From following me? Did you disobey my command?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					He said, "Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or my head. I feared
					you would say, `You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and did
					not regard my word.'"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					He said, "What do you have to say, O Samarian?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					He said, "I saw what they did not see, so I grasped a handful from the
					Messenger's traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul prompted me."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					He said, "Begone! Your lot in this life is to say, 'No contact.' And you have
					an appointment that you will not miss. Now look at your god that you remained
					devoted to-we will burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, as powder."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					Surely your god is God, the One besides whom there is no other god. He
					comprehends everything in knowledge.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 99
			-
				-
					Thus We narrate to you reports of times gone by; and We have given you a
					message from Our Presence.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					Whoever turns away from it will carry on the Day of Resurrection a burden.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					Abiding therein forever. And wretched is their burden on the Day of
					Resurrection.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					On the Day when the Trumpet is blown-We will gather the sinners on that Day,
					blue.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Murmuring among themselves: "You have lingered only for ten."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					We are fully aware of what they say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct
					will say, "You have lingered only a day."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					And they ask you about the mountains. Say, "My Lord will crumble them utterly."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					And leave them desolate waste.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					You will see in them neither crookedness, nor deviation."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					On that Day, they will follow the caller, without any deviation. Voices will be
					hushed before the Merciful, and you will hear nothing but murmur.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					On that Day, intercession will not avail, except for him permitted by the
					Merciful, and whose words He has approved.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot

				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 111
			-
				-
					Faces will be humbled before the Living, the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice
					will despair.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 112
			-
				-
					But whoever has done righteous deeds, while being a believer-will fear neither
					injustice, nor grievance.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 113
			-
				-
					Thus We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, and We have diversified the warnings
					in it, that perhaps they would become righteous, or it may produce a lesson for
					them.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					Exalted is God, the True King. Do not be hasty with the Quran before its
					inspiration to you is concluded, and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					And We covenanted with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no
					resolve.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 116
			-
				-
					And when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam." They bowed down, except for
					Satan; he refused.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 117
			-
				-
					We said, "Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him
					make you leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 118
			-
				-
					In it you will never go hungry, nor be naked.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 119
			-
				-
					Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you swelter."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 120
			-
				-
					But Satan whispered to him. He said, "Adam, shall I show you the Tree of
					Immortality, and a kingdom that never decays?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 121
			-
				-
					And so they ate from it; whereupon their bodies became visible to them, and
					they started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam
					disobeyed his Lord, and fell.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 122
			-
				-
					But then his Lord recalled him, and pardoned him, and guided him.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 123
			-
				-
					He said, "Go down from it, altogether; some of you enemies of some others. But
					whenever guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance, will not
					go astray, nor suffer.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 124
			-
				-
					But whoever turns away from My Reminder, for him is a confined life. And We
					will raise him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 125
			-
				-
					He will say, "My Lord, why did You raise me blind, though I was seeing?"
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 126
			-
				-
					He will say, "Just as Our revelations came to you, and you forgot them, today
					you will be forgotten."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 127
			-
				-
					Thus We recompense him who transgresses and does not believe in the revelations
					of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and more lasting.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 128
			-
				-
					Is it not instructive to them, how many generations before them We destroyed,
					in whose settlements they walk? Surely in that are signs for people of
					understanding.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 129
			-
				-
					Were it not for a word that issued from your Lord, the inevitable would have
					happened, but there is an appointed term.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 130
			-
				-
					So bear patiently what they say, and celebrate the praises of your Lord before
					the rising of the sun, and before its setting. And during the hours of the
					night glorify Him, and at the borders of the day, that you may be satisfied.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 131
			-
				-
					And do not extend your glance towards what We have given some classes of them
					to enjoy-the splendor of the life of this world-that We may test them thereby.
					Your Lord's provision is better, and more lasting.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 132
			-
				-
					And exhort your people to pray, and patiently adhere to it. We ask of you no
					sustenance, but it is We who sustain you. The good ending is that for
					righteousness.
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 133
			-
				-
					And they say, "Why does he not bring us a miracle from his Lord?" Were they not
					given enough miracles in the former scriptures?
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 134
			-
				-
					Had We destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our
					Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your
					revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced."
				-
			-
				Surah 20 - Ta-Ha: Ayah 135
			-
				-
					Say, "Everybody is waiting, so wait. You will know who the people of the
					straight path are, and who is rightly-guided.

				-
					In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
				-

			-
				-
					Mankind's reckoning has drawn near, but they turn away heedlessly.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					No fresh reminder comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it
					playfully.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers confer secretly, "Is this anything but
					a mortal like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open-eyes?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord knows what is said in the heaven and the earth; and He is the
					Hearer, the Knower."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					And they said, "A jumble of dreams," and, "He made it up," and, "He is a poet,"
					"let him bring us a sign, like those sent to the ancients."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					None of the towns We destroyed before them had believed. Will they, then,
					believe?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					We did not send before you except men, whom We inspired. Ask the people of
					knowledge, if you do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					We did not make them mere bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, and We saved them together with whomever
					We willed, and We destroyed the extravagant.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					We have sent down to you a Book, containing your message. Do you not

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					How many a guilty town have We crushed, and established thereafter another
					people?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Then, when they sensed Our might, they started running away from it.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Do not run, but come back to your luxuries, and to your homes, that you may be
					questioned.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					They said, "Woe to us; we were unfair."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					This continued to be their cry, until We made them silent ashes.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					We did not create the sky and the earth and what is between them for amusement.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					If We wanted amusement, We could have found it within Us, were We to do so.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes it, so it
					vanishes. Woe unto you, for what you describe.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					To Him belongs everyone in the heavens and the earth. Those near Him are not
					too proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					They praise night and day, without ever tiring.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Or have they taken to themselves gods from the earth who resurrect?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					If there were in them gods other than God, they would have gone to ruin. So
					glory be to God, Lord of the Throne, beyond what they allege.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					He will not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					Or have they taken, besides Him, other gods? Say, "Bring your proof. This is a

					do not know the truth, so they turn away.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					We never sent a messenger before you without inspiring him that: "There is no

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken to himself a son." Be He glorified;
					they are but honored servants.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					They never speak before He has spoken, and they only act on His command.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					He knows what is before them, and what is behind them; and they do not

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					And whoever of them says, "I am a god besides Him," We will reward him with

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were one mass, and
					We tore them apart? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not
					believe?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it sways with them, and We placed

			-
				-
					And We made the sky a protected ceiling; yet they turn away from its wonders.

					It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					We did not grant immortality to any human being before you. Should you die, are

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Every soul will taste death. We burden you with adversity and prosperity-a

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					When those who disbelieve see you, they treat you only with ridicule: "Is this

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					The human being was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not seek

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And they say, "When will this promise come true, if you are truthful?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					If those who disbelieve only knew, when they cannot keep the fire off their

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, and bewilder them. They will not be
					able to repel it, and they will not be reprieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Messengers before you were also ridiculed, but those who jeered were surrounded

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Say, "Who guards you against the Merciful by night and by day?" But they turn
					away from the mention of their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Or do they have gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot help
					themselves, nor will they be protected from Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					We have given these enjoyments, and their ancestors, until time grew long upon
					them. Do they not see how We gradually reduce the land from its extremities?
					Are they then the victors?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Say, "I am warning you through inspiration." But the deaf cannot hear the call
					when they are being warned.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					And when a breath of your Lord's punishment touches them, they say, "Woe to us,
					we were truly wicked."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					We will set up the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so that no

					mustard-seed, We will bring it up. Sufficient are We as Reckoners.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and illumination, and a reminder for the

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Those who fear their Lord in private, and are apprehensive of the Hour.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					This too is a blessed message that We revealed. Are you going to deny it?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, and We knew him well.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					When he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you
					are devoted?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					They said, "We found our parents worshiping them."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					He said, "You and your parents are in evident error."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					They said, "Are you telling us the truth, or are you just playing?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					He said, "Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the One who
					created them, and I bear witness to that.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					"By God, I will have a plan for your statues after you have gone away."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					So he reduced them into pieces, except for their biggest, that they may return
					to it.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					They said, "Who did this to our gods? He is certainly one of the wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					They said, "We heard a youth mentioning them. He is called Abraham."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					They said, "Bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may witness."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					They said, "Are you the one who did this to our gods, O Abraham?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					He said, "But it was this biggest of them that did it. Ask them, if they can
					speak."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Then they turned to one another, and said, "You yourselves are the wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					But they reverted to their old ideas: "You certainly know that these do not
					speak."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					He said, "Do you worship, instead of God, what can neither benefit you in
					anything, nor harm you?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					Fie on you, and on what you worship instead of God. Do you not understand?"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					They said, "Burn him and support your gods, if you are going to act."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					We said, "fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					They planned to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					And We delivered him, and Lot, to the land that We blessed for all people.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift; and each We made righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					And We made them leaders, guiding by Our command; and We inspired them to do
					good works, and to observe the prayer, and to give out charity. They were
					devoted servants to Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					And Lot-We gave him judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town
					that practiced the abominations. They were wicked and perverted people.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					And We admitted him into Our mercy; for He was one of the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					And Noah, when he called before. So We answered him, and delivered him and his
					family from the great disaster.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					And We supported him against the people who rejected Our signs. They were an
					evil people, so We drowned them all.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the case of the field, when
					some people's sheep wandered therein by night; and We were witnesses to their
					judgment.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					And so We made Solomon understand it, and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge.
					And We subjected the mountains along with David to sing Our praises, and the
					birds as well-surely We did.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And We taught him the making of shields for you, to protect you from your
					violence. Are you, then, appreciative?
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing at His command towards the land that We
					have blessed. We are aware of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					And of the devils were some that dived for him, and performed other, lesser
					tasks. But We kept them restrained.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: "Great harm has afflicted me, and you
					are the Most Merciful of the merciful."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					So We answered him, lifted his suffering, and restored his family to him, and
					their like with them-a mercy from Us, and a reminder for the worshipers.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					And Ishmael, and Enoch, and Ezekiel; each was one of the steadfast.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					And We admitted them into Our mercy. They were among the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					And Jonah, when he stormed out in fury, thinking We had no power over him. But
					then He cried out in the darkness, "There is no god but You! Glory to You! I
					was one of the wrongdoers!"
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					So We answered him, and saved him from the affliction. Thus We save the
					faithful.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					And Zechariah, when he called out to his Lord, "My Lord, do not leave me alone,
					even though you are the Best of heirs."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					So We answered him, and gave him John. And We cured his wife for him. They used
					to vie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call on Us in love and awe, and
					they used to humble themselves to Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					And she who guarded her virginity. We breathed into her of Our spirit, and made

			-
				-
					This community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.

			-
				-
					But they splintered themselves into factions. They will all return to Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a believer, his effort will not be denied.
					We are writing it down for him.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					There is a ban on the town that We had destroyed-that they will not return.

			-
				-
					Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they swarm down from every mound.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					The promise of truth has drawn near. The eyes of those who disbelieved will

					wrongdoers."
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 98
			-

					You and what you worship besides God are fuel for Hell. You will descend into

				-
					Had these been gods, they would not have descended into it. All will abide in

				-
					In it they will wail. In it they will not hear.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					As for those who deserved goodness from Us-these will be kept away from it.
				-

				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					They will not hear its hissing, and they will forever abide in what their

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					The Supreme Fear will not worry them, and the angels will receive them: "This

				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 104
			-
				-
					On the Day when We fold the heaven, like the folding of a book. Just as We

					act.
				-
			-
				Surah 21 - The Prophets: Ayah 105
			-
				-
					We have written in the Psalms, after the Reminder, that the earth will be

			-
				-
					O people, be conscious of your Lord. The quaking of the Hour is a tremendous
					thing.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					On the Day when you will see it: every nursing mother will discard her infant,
					and every pregnant woman will abort her load, and you will see the people
					drunk, even though they are not drunk-but the punishment of God is severe.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					Among the people is he who argues about God without knowledge, and follows
					every defiant devil.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					It was decreed for him, that whoever follows him-he will misguide him, and lead
					him to the torment of the Blaze.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					O people! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection-We created you from dust,
					then from a small drop, then from a clinging clot, then from a lump of flesh,
					partly developed and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify things for you.
					And We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a designated term, and then We
					bring you out as infants, until you reach your full strength. And some of you
					will pass away, and some of you will be returned to the vilest age, so that he
					may not know, after having known. And you see the earth still; but when We send
					down water on it, it vibrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of lovely pairs.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					That is because God is the truth, and because He gives life to the dead, and
					because He is Capable of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					And because the Hour is coming-there is no doubt about it-and because God will
					resurrect those in the graves.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					And among the people is he who argues about God without knowledge, or guidance,
					or an enlightening scripture.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Turning aside in contempt, to lead away from the path of God. He will have
					humiliation in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make him
					taste the agony of burning.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					That is for what your hands have advanced, and because God is not unjust to the
					servants.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					And among the people is he who worships God on edge. When something good comes
					his way, he is content with it. But when an ordeal strikes him, he makes a
					turnaround. He loses this world and the next. That is the obvious loss.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					He invokes, instead of God, what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is
					the far straying.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit. What a miserable master.
					What a miserable companion.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into Gardens beneath
					which rivers flow. God does whatever He wills.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					Whoever thinks that God will not help him in this life and in the Hereafter-let
					him turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cunning eliminates what enrages
					him.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and God guides whomever He wills.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Sabeans, and the

					them on the Day of Resurrection. God is witness to all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					Do you not realize that to God prostrates everyone in the heavens and everyone
					on earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the
					trees, and the animals, and many of the people? But many are justly deserving
					of punishment. Whomever God shames, there is none to honor him. God does
					whatever He wills.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Here are two adversaries feuding regarding their Lord. As for those who

				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					Melting their insides and their skins.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					And they will have maces of iron.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					Whenever they try to escape the gloom, they will be driven back to it: "Taste
					the suffering of burning."
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					But God will admit those who believe and do good deeds into Gardens beneath

				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					They were guided to purity of speech. They were guided to the path of the Most

				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					As for those who disbelieve and repel from God's path and from the Sacred
					Mosque-which We have designated for all mankind equally, whether residing
					therein or passing through-and seek to commit sacrilege therein-We will make
					him taste of a painful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					We showed Abraham the location of the House: "Do not associate anything with
					Me; and purify My House for those who circle around, and those who stand to
					pray, and those who kneel and prostrate."
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					And announce the pilgrimage to humanity. They will come to you on foot, and on
					every transport. They will come from every distant point.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					That they may witness the benefits for themselves, and celebrate the name of
					God during the appointed days, for providing them with the animal livestock. So
					eat from it, and feed the unfortunate poor.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					Then let them perform their acts of cleansing, and fulfill their vows, and
					circle around the Ancient House.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities of God-it is good for him with his
					Lord. All livestock are permitted to you, except what is recited to you. So
					stay away from the abomination of idols, and stay away from perjury.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Being true to God, without associating anything with Him. Whoever associates
					anything with God-it is as though he has fallen from the sky, and is snatched
					by the birds, or is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments of God-it is from the piety of the
					hearts.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					In them are benefits for you until a certain time. Then their place is by the
					Ancient House.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					We have appointed a rite for every nation, that they may commemorate God's name
					over the livestock He has provided for them. Your God is One God, so to Him
					submit, and announce good news to the humble.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Those whose hearts tremble when God is mentioned, and those who endure what has
					befallen them, and those who perform the prayer and spend from what We have
					provided for them.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					We have made the animal offerings emblems of God for you. In them is goodness
					for you. So pronounce God's name upon them as they line up. Then, when they
					have fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the contented and the beggar.
					Thus We have subjected them to you, that you may be thankful.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever reaches God. What reaches Him is the
					righteousness from you. Thus He subdued them to you, that you may glorify God
					for guiding you. And give good news to the charitable.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					God defends those who believe. God does not love any ungrateful traitor.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Permission is given to those who are fought against, and God is Able to give
					them victory.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Those who were unjustly evicted from their homes, merely for saying, "Our Lord
					is God." Were it not that God repels people by means of others: monasteries,
					churches, synagogues, and mosques-where the name of God is mentioned much-would
					have been demolished. God supports whoever supports Him. God is Strong and
					Mighty.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Those who, when We empower them in the land, observe the prayer, and give
					regular charity, and command what is right, and forbid what is wrong. To God
					belongs the outcome of events.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					If they deny you-before them the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also
					denied.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses was denied. Then I reprieved those who
					disbelieved, but then I seized them. So how was My rejection?
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					How many a town have We destroyed while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins;
					with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Have they not journeyed in the land, and had minds to reason with, or ears to
					listen with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is the hearts, within the
					chests, that go blind.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And they ask you to hasten the punishment. But God never breaks His promise. A
					day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your count.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					How many a town have I reprieved, although it was unjust? Then I seized it. To
					Me is the destination.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Say, "people, I am only a plain warner to you."
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					Those who believe and work righteousness-for them is forgiveness and a generous
					provision.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					But those who strive against Our revelations-these are the inmates of Hell.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					We never sent a messenger before you, or a prophet, but when he had a desire
					Satan interfered in his wishes. But God nullifies what Satan interjects, and
					God affirms His revelations. God is Omniscient and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					In order to make Satan's suggestions a trial for those whose hearts are
					diseased, and those whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers are in profound
					discord.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					And so that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the truth from
					your Lord, and so believe in it, and their hearts soften to it. God guides
					those who believe to a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve will continue to be hesitant about it, until the Hour
					comes upon them suddenly, or there comes to them the torment of a desolate Day.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Sovereignty on that Day belongs to God; He will judge between them. Those who
					believe and do good deeds will be in the Gardens of Bliss.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					But those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations-these will have a
					humiliating punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Those who emigrate in God's cause, then get killed, or die, God will provide
					them with fine provisions. God is the Best of Providers.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					He will admit them an admittance that will please them. God is Knowing and
					Clement.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to the affliction he was made to
					suffer, and then he is wronged again, God will definitely assist him. God is
					Pardoning and Forgiving.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					That is because God merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into
					the night, and because God is Hearing and Seeing.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					That is because God is the Reality, and what they invoke besides Him is vanity,
					and because God is the Sublime, the Grand.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, and the land becomes
					green? God is Kind and Aware.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. God is the
					Rich, the Praised.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Do you not see that God made everything on earth subservient to you? How the
					ships sail at sea by His command? That He holds up the sky lest it falls on
					earth-except by His permission? God is Gracious towards the people, Most
					Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					And it is He who gives you life, then makes you die, then revives you. The
					human being is unappreciative.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					For every congregation We have appointed acts of devotion, which they observe.
					So do not let them dispute with you in this matter. And invite to your Lord;
					you are upon a straight guidance.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					But if they dispute with you, say, "God is fully aware of what you do."
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection regarding what you
					disagree about.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Do you not know that God knows everything in the heavens and the earth? This is
					in a book. That is easy for God.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					Yet they worship, besides God, things for which He sent down no warrant, and
					what they have no knowledge of. There is no savior for the transgressors.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, you will recognize disgust on
					the faces of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault those who recite to them
					Our Verses. Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that? The Fire!
					God has promised it to those who disbelieve. And what a wretched outcome!"
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					O people! A parable is presented, so listen to it: Those you invoke besides God
					will never create a fly, even if they banded together for that purpose. And if
					the fly steals anything from them, they cannot recover it from it. Weak are the
					pursuer and the pursued.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					They do not value God as He should be valued. God is Strong and Powerful.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					God chooses messengers from among the angels, and from among the people. God is
					Hearing and Seeing.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					He knows what is before them, and what is behind them. To God all matters are
					referred.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, and worship your Lord, and do good
					deeds, so that you may succeed.
				-
			-
				Surah 22 - The Pilgrimage: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					And strive for God, with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you, and has
					not burdened you in religion-the faith of your father Abraham. It is he who
					named you Muslims before, and in this. So that the Messenger may be a witness
					over you, and you may be witnesses over the people. So pray regularly, and give
					regular charity, and cleave to God. He is your Protector. What an excellent
					Protector, and what an excellent Helper.

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					But the notables of his people, who disbelieved, said, "This is nothing but a

					of the Hereafter, and We had indulged them in the present life, said, "This is
					nothing but a human like you; he eats what you eat, and he drinks what you
					drink.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					If you obey a human being like yourselves, then you will be losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones, you will
					be brought out?
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Farfetched, farfetched is what you are promised.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					There is nothing but our life in this world. We die, and we live, and we are
					not resurrected.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					He is nothing but a man, making up lies about God. We have no faith in him."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, help me, for they have rejected me."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					He said, "Soon they will be filled with regret."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and We turned them into scum. So away
					with the wicked people.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Then, after them, We raised other generations.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					No nation can advance its time, nor can they postpone it.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time a messenger came to his
					community, they called him a liar. So We made them follow one another, and made
					them history. So away with a people who do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our signs and a clear authority.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned arrogant. They were oppressive
					people.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					They said, "Are we to believe in two mortals like us, and their people are our
					slaves?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					So they called them liars, and thus were among those destroyed.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And We gave Moses the Scripture, that they may be guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					And We made Mary's son and his mother a sign, and We sheltered them on high

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					O messengers, eat of the good things, and act with integrity. I am aware of

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					This nation of yours is one nation, and I am your Lord, so fear Me.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					But they tore themselves into sects; each party happy with what they have.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					So leave them in their bewilderment until a time.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					Do they assume that, in furnishing them with wealth and children.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					We race to give them the good things? In fact, they have no idea.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Those who, from awe of their Lord, are fearful.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And those who believe in their Lord's Verses.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					And those who associate no partners with their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					And those who give what they give, while their hearts quake, knowing that to
					their Lord they will return.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					It is they who race towards goodness. It is they who will reach it first.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					We never burden any soul beyond its capacity. And with Us is a record that
					tells the truth, and they will not be wronged.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					But their hearts are puzzled because of this; and they have deeds that do not
					conform to this, which they continue to perpetrate.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Until, when We seize the decadent among them with torment, they begin to groan.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Do not groan today. You will receive no help from Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					My Verses were recited to you, but you turned back on your heels.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					Arrogant towards it-talked nonsense about it-disregarded it.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Have they not pondered the Word? Or has there come to them what came not to

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Or is it that they did not recognize their messenger, so they are denying him?
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Or do they say, "He is possessed?" In fact, he brought them the truth, but most
					of them hate the truth.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					If the truth conformed to their desires, the heavens, the earth, and everyone
					in them would have gone to ruin. In fact, We have given them their message, but
					they keep avoiding their message.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					Or are you asking them for a payment? The revenue from your Lord is better, and

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					You are inviting them to a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					But those who do not believe in the Hereafter are swerving from the path.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					Even if We had mercy on them, and relieved their problems, they would still
					blindly persist in their defiance.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					We have already gripped them with suffering, but they did not surrender to

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Until, when We have opened before them a gate of intense agony, at once they

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					It is He who produced for you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the feelings.
					But little gratitude you show.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					And it is He who multiplied you on earth, and to Him you will be gathered.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And it is He who gives life and brings death, and to Him is the alternation of
					night and day. Do you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					But they say the like of what the ancients said.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					They say, "After we have died, and become dust and bones, will we be
					resurrected?
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					We were promised this before-we and our ancestors-these are nothing but legends
					of the ancients."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Say, "To whom does the earth belong, and everyone in it, if you happen to
					know?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					They will say, "To God." Say, "Will you not reflect?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Say, "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Splendid Throne?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					They will say, "To God." Say, "Will you not become righteous?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Say, "In whose hand is the dominion of all things, and He protects and cannot
					be protected from, if you happen to know?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					They will say, "To God." Say, "Then are you bewitched?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					In fact, We have given them the truth, and they are liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 91
			-
				-
					God has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each
					god would have taken away what it has created, and some of them would have
					gained supremacy over others. Glory be to God, far beyond what they describe.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					The Knower of the hidden and the manifest. He is exalted, far above what they
					associate.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Say, "My Lord, if You would show me what they are promised.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					My Lord, do not place me among the wicked people."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					We are surely Able to show you what We promise them.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 96
			-
				-
					Repel evil by what is better. We are aware of what they describe.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 97
			-
				-
					And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the urgings of the devils.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they become present."
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 100
			-
				-
					That I may do right in what I have neglected." By no means! It is just a word

					resurrected.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 101
			-
				-
					When the Horn is blown, no relations between them will exist on that Day, and

			-
				-
					Those whose scales are heavy-those are the successful.
				-

					But those whose scales are light-those are they who have lost their souls; in

			-
				-
					"Were not My revelations recited to you, and you kept on rejecting them?"
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness prevailed over us, and we were a

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever returned, we would truly be evil."
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 108
			-
				-
					He will say, "Be despised therein, and do not speak to Me.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 109
			-
				-
					There was a group of My servants who would say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 110
			-
				-
					But you made them a target of ridicule, until they made you forget My

				-
					Today, I have rewarded them for their endurance. They are the ones who are the

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 114
			-
				-
					He will say, "You remained only for a little while, if you only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 115
			-
				-
					Did you think that We created you in vain, and that to Us you will not be

				-
			-

					So Exalted is God, the Ruler, the Real. There is no god except He, the Lord of

				-
			-
				Surah 23 - The Believers: Ayah 117

			-
				-
					The adulteress and the adulterer-whip each one of them a hundred lashes, and

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					The adulterer shall marry none but an adulteress or an idolatress; and the

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					Those who accuse chaste women, then cannot bring four witnesses, whip them

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					Except for those who repent afterwards, and reform; for God is Forgiving and

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					As for those who accuse their own spouses, but have no witnesses except

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					And the fifth time, that God's curse be upon him, if he is a liar.

				-
					Those who perpetrated the slander are a band of you. Do not consider it bad for

					As for him who played the major role-for him is a terrible punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Why, when you heard about it, the believing men and women did not think well of

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Why did they not bring four witnesses to testify to it? If they fail to bring

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 16

					O you who believe! Do not follow Satan's footsteps. Whoever follows Satan's

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 27

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 28
			-

					And tell the believing women to restrain their looks, and to guard their

					their women, what their right hands possess, their male attendants who have no
					sexual desires, or children who are not yet aware of the nakedness of women.
					And they should not strike their feet to draw attention to their hidden beauty.
					And repent to God, all of you believers, so that you may succeed.

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					And let those who do not find the means to marry abstain, until God enriches

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The allegory of His light is
					that of a pillar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a glass. The glass is
					like a brilliant planet, fueled by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither
					eastern nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, even if no fire has
					touched it. Light upon Light. God guides to His light whomever He wills. God
					thus cites the parables for the people. God is cognizant of everything.

					As for those who disbelieve, their works are like a mirage in a desert. The

					Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, covered by waves, above which are

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Do you not realize that God is glorified by whatever is in the heavens and the

			-
				-
					Have you not seen how God propels the clouds, then brings them together, then
					piles them into a heap, and you see rain drops emerging from its midst? How He
					brings down loads of hail from the sky, striking with it whomever He wills, and
					diverting it from whomever He wills? The flash of its lightening almost
					snatches the sight away.
				-

					God alternates the night and the day. In that is a lesson for those who have

			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					God created every living creature from water. Some of them crawl on their

					And when they are called to God and His Messenger, in order to judge between

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					The response of the believers, when they are called to God and His Messenger in

					Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God, and is conscious of

					And they swear by God with their solemn oaths, that if you commanded them, they

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Say, "Obey God and obey the Messenger." But if they turn away, then he is

					And if you obey him, you will be guided. It is only incumbent on the Messenger
					to deliver the Clarifying Message.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					God has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds, that He will
					make them successors on earth, as He made those before them successors, and He
					will establish for them their religion-which He has approved for them-and He
					will substitute security in place of their fear. They worship Me, never

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Permission must be requested by your servants and those of
					you who have not reached puberty. On three occasions: before the Dawn Prayer,
					and at noon when you change your clothes, and after the Evening Prayer. These
					are three occasions of privacy for you. At other times, it is not wrong for you
					or them to intermingle with one another. God thus clarifies the revelations for
					you. God is Knowledgeable and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					When the children among you reach puberty, they must ask permission, as those

				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Women past the age of childbearing, who have no desire for marriage, commit no

				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					There is no blame on the blind, nor any blame on the lame, nor any blame on the

					your mothers' homes, or your brothers' homes, or your sisters' homes, or the
					homes of your paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, or the
					homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal aunts, or those
					whose keys you own, or the homes of your friends. You commit no wrong by eating
					together or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a
					greeting from God, blessed and good. God thus explains the revelations for you,
					so that you may understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger, and when they are
					with him for a matter of common interest, they do not leave until they have
					asked him for permission. Those who ask your permission are those who believe
					in God and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission to attend to some
					affair of theirs, give permission to any of them you wish, and ask God's
					forgiveness for them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Do not address the Messenger in the same manner you address one another. God

					his orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or a painful punishment befalls
					them.
				-
			-
				Surah 24 - The Light: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Surely, to God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. He knows what

					He said, "I did it then, when I was of those astray.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					And I fled from you when I feared you; but my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me

				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					Is that the favor you taunt me with, although you have enslaved the Children of

			-
				-
					Pharaoh said, "And what is the Lord of the Worlds?"
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					He said, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them,

				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					He said to those around him, "Do you not hear?"
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					He said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of old."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					He said, "This messenger of yours, who is sent to you, is crazy."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					He said, "Lord of the East and the West, and everything between them, if you

				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					He said, "If you accept any god other than me, I will make you a prisoner."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					He said, "What if I bring you something convincing?"
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					He said, "Bring it, if you are being truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, plain to see.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					And he pulled his hand; and it was white, for all to see.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					He said to the dignitaries around him, "This is a skilled magician.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					He intends to drive you out of your land with his magic, so what do you

				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					They said, "Delay him and his brother, and send recruiters to the cities.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					To bring you every experienced magician."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					So the magicians were gathered for the appointment on a specified day.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					And it was said to the people, "Are you all gathered?
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					That we may follow the magicians, if they are the winners."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					When the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Is there a reward for us, if

				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					He said, "Yes, and you will be among those favored."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Moses said to them, "Present what you intend to present."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said, "By the majesty of
					Pharaoh, we will be the winners."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it began swallowing their trickery.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					And the magicians fell down prostrating.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					He said, "Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? He must be
					your chief, who taught you magic. You will soon know. I will cut off your hands
					and feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					They said, "No problem. To our Lord we will return.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our sins, since we are the first of the
					believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					And We inspired Moses: "Travel with My servants by night. You will be
					followed."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					"These are a small gang.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					And they are enraging us.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					But we are a vigilant multitude."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					So We drove them out of gardens and springs.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And treasures and noble dwellings.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					So it was. And We made the Children of Israel inherit them.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					And they pursued them at sunrise.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					When the two groups sighted each other, the followers of Moses said, "We are
					being overtaken."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					He said, "No; my Lord is with me, He will guide me."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					We inspired Moses: "Strike the sea with your staff." Whereupon it parted, and
					each part was like a huge hill.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					And there We brought the others near.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Then We drowned the others.
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					In that there is a sign, but most of them are not believers.

			-
				-
					When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
				-
			-

			-
				-
					They said, "We worship idols, and we remain devoted to them."
				-
			-

			-
				-
					He said, "Do they hear you when you pray?
				-

			-
				-
					Or do they benefit you, or harm you?"
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					They said, "But we found our ancestors doing so."
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					He said, "Have you considered what you worship.
				-
			-

				-
					You and your ancient ancestors?
				-
			-
				Surah 26 - The Poets: Ayah 77

			-
				-
					And give me a reputation of truth among the others.

					Besides God? Can they help you, or help themselves?"

					Have you considered: if We let them enjoy themselves for some years.

					These are the Verses of the Clear Book.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh-in truth-for people who
					believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and divided its people into factions. He
					persecuted a group of them, slaughtering their sons, while sparing their
					daughters. He was truly a corrupter.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					But We desired to favor those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them
					leaders, and to make them the inheritors.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					And to establish them in the land; and to show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their
					troops, the very thing they feared.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					We inspired the mother of Moses: "Nurse him; then, when you fear for him, cast
					him into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We will return him to you, and
					make him one of the messengers."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					Pharaoh's household picked him up, to be an opponent and a sorrow for them.
					Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Pharaoh's wife said, "An eye's delight for me and for you. Do not kill him;
					perhaps he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son." But they did
					not foresee.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					The heart of Moses' mother became vacant. She was about to disclose him, had We
					not steadied her heart, that she may remain a believer.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					She said to his sister, "Trail him." So she watched him from afar, and they
					were unaware.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So she said, "Shall I tell you about a
					family that can raise him for you, and will look after him?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Thus We returned him to his mother, that she may be comforted, and not grieve,
					and know that God's promise is true. But most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					And when he reached his maturity, and became established, We gave him wisdom
					and knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					Once he entered the city, unnoticed by its people. He found in it two men
					fighting-one of his own sect, and one from his enemies. The one of his sect
					solicited his assistance against the one from his enemies; so Moses punched
					him, and put an end to him. He said, "This is of Satan's doing; he is an enemy
					that openly misleads."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me." So He forgave him. He
					is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, in as much as you have favored me, I will never be a
					supporter of the criminals."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					The next morning, he went about in the city, fearful and vigilant, when the man
					who had sought his assistance the day before was shouting out to him. Moses
					said to him, "You are clearly a troublemaker."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					As he was about to strike the one who was their enemy, he said, "Moses, do you
					intend to kill me, as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a bully
					in the land, and do not want to be a peacemaker."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					And a man came from the farthest part of the city running. He said, "Moses, the
					authorities are considering killing you, so leave; I am giving you good
					advice."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, "My Lord, deliver me from the
					wrongdoing people."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					As he headed towards Median, he said, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the
					right way."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					And when he arrived at the waters of Median, he found there a crowd of people
					drawing water, and he noticed two women waiting on the side. He said, "What is
					the matter with you?" They said, "We cannot draw water until the shepherds
					depart, and our father is a very old man."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					So he drew water for them, and then withdrew to the shade, and said, "My Lord,
					I am in dire need of whatever good you might send down to me."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					Then, one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said, "My
					father is calling you, to reward you for drawing water for us." And when he
					came to him, and told him the story, he said, "Do not fear, you have escaped
					from the wrongdoing people."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					One of the two women said, "Father, hire him; the best employee for you is the
					strong and trustworthy."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					He said, "I want to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, provided
					you work for me for eight years. But if you complete ten, that is up to you. I
					do not intend to impose any hardship on you. You will find me, God willing, one
					of the righteous."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					He said, "Let this be an agreement between you and me. Whichever of the two
					terms I fulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me; and God is witness over
					what we say."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					When Moses had completed the term, and departed with his family, he noticed a
					fire by the side of the Mount. He said to his family, "Stay here, I have
					glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you some information from there, or an
					ember from the fire, that you may warm yourselves."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					When he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley, at the
					Blessed Spot, from the bush: "Moses, it is I, God, the Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Throw down your staff." And when he saw it wiggling, as if it were possessed,
					he turned his back to flee, and did not look back. "Moses, come forward, and do
					not fear, you are perfectly safe.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish.
					And press your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from your
					Lord, to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly sinful people."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, I have killed one of them, and I fear they will kill me.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent than me, so send him with me, to help
					me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they will reject me."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					He said, "We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you
					authority, so they will not touch you. By virtue of Our signs, you and those
					who follow you will be the triumphant."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					But when Moses came to them with Our signs, clear and manifest, they said,
					"This is nothing but fabricated magic, and We never heard of this from our
					ancestors of old."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Moses said, "My Lord is well aware of him who brings guidance from Him, and him
					who will have the sequel of the abode. The wrongdoers will not succeed."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					Pharaoh said, "nobles, I know of no god for you other than me. So fire-up the
					bricks for me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that I may ascend to the God of
					Moses, though I think he is a liar."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					He and his troops acted arrogantly in the land, with no justification. They
					thought they would not be returned to Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					So We seized him, and his troops, and We threw them into the sea. Observe,
					therefore, what was the end of the oppressors.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					And We made them leaders calling to the Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they
					will not be saved.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And We pursued them in this world with a curse. And on Resurrection Day, they
					will be among the despised.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					We gave Moses the Scripture after We had annihilated the previous generations;
					as an illumination for mankind, and guidance, and mercy, so that they may
					remember.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					You were not on the Western Side when We decreed the command to Moses, nor were
					you among the witnesses.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					But We established many generations, and time took its toll on them. Nor were
					you among the people of Median, reciting Our revelations to them. But We kept
					sending messengers.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Nor were you by the side of the Mount when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a
					mercy from your Lord, that you may warn people who received no warner before
					you, so that they may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a result of what their hands have
					perpetrated, they would say, "Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we
					would have followed Your revelations, and been among the believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "If only he was given the
					like of what was given to Moses." Did they not disbelieve in what was given to
					Moses in the past? They said, "Two works of magic backing one another." And
					they said, "We are disbelieving in both."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					Say, "Then bring a scripture from God, more conductive to guidance than both,
					and I will follow it, if you are truthful."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					But if they fail to respond to you, know that they follow their fancies. And
					who is more lost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from God? God
					does not guide the unjust people.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					We have delivered the Word to them, that they may remember.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it believe in it.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					When it is recited to them, they say, "We have believed in it; it is the truth
					from our Lord; we were Muslims prior to it."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					These will be given their reward twice, because they persevered; and they
					counter evil with good; and from Our provisions to them, they give.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					And when they hear vain talk, they avoid it, and say, "We have our deeds, and
					you have your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not desire the ignorant."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					You cannot guide whom you love, but God guides whom He wills, and He knows best
					those who are guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					And they say, "If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched from our
					land." Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctuary, to which are brought all
					kinds of fruits, as provision from Ourselves? But most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And how many a city did We destroy for turning unappreciative of its
					livelihood? Here are their homes, uninhabited after them, except for a few. And
					We became the Inheritors.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Your Lord never destroys cities without first sending a messenger in their
					midst, reciting to them Our revelations. And We never destroy the cities,
					unless their people are wrongdoers.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Whatever thing you are given is but the material of this world, and its
					glitter. But what is with God is better, and longer lasting. Do you not
					comprehend?
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					Can someone to whom We have made a fine promise-which he will attain-be equal
					to someone to whom We have given enjoyments in this world, but who will be, on
					Resurrection Day, among the arraigned?
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					On the Day when He will call to them, and say, "Where are My associates whom
					you used to claim?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Those against whom the sentence is justified will say, "Our Lord, these are
					they whom we misled. We misled them, as we were misled. We beg Your
					forgiveness; it was not us they used to worship."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					And it will be said, "Call on your partners." And they will call on them, but
					they will not respond to them. And they will see the suffering. If only they
					were guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					On the Day when He will call to them, and say, "What did you answer the
					Messengers?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					They will be blinded by the facts on that Day, and they will not question each
					other.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					But he who repents, and believes, and does righteous deeds, may well be among
					the winners.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and He chooses. The choice is not theirs.
					Glory be to God, and exalted be He above the associations they make.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and what they reveal.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					And He is God. There is no god but He. To Him belongs all praise in this life,
					and in the next. And His is the decision, and to Him you will be returned.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? Had God made the night perpetual over you until the
					Day of Resurrection, which god other than God will bring you illumination? Do
					you not hear?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered? Had God made the day perpetual over you until the
					Day of Resurrection, which god other than God will bring you night to rest in?
					Do you not see?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					It is out of His mercy that He made for you the night and the day, that you may
					rest in it, and seek some of His bounty; and that you may give thanks.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					On the Day when He will call to them, and say, "Where are My associates whom
					you used to claim?"
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					And We will draw out from every community a witness, and say, "Produce your
					evidence." Then they will realize that the truth is God's, and those they used
					to invent have forsaken them.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, but he oppressed them. We had given him
					treasures, the keys of which would weigh down a group of strong men. His people
					said to him, "Do not exult; God does not love the exultant.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					But seek, with what God has given you, the Home of the Hereafter, and do not
					neglect your share of this world. And be charitable, as God has been charitable
					to you. And do not seek corruption in the land. God does not like the seekers
					of corruption."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					He said, "I was given all this on account of knowledge I possess." Did he not
					know that God destroyed many generations before him, who were stronger than he,
					and possessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their
					sins.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					And he went out before his people in his splendor. Those who desired the
					worldly life said, "If only we possessed the likes of what Quaroon was given.
					He is indeed very fortunate."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					But those who were given knowledge said, "Woe to you! The reward of God is
					better for those who believe and do righteous deeds." Yet none attains it
					except the steadfast.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					So We caused the earth to cave in on him and his mansion. He had no company to
					save him from God, and he could not defend himself.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					Those who had wished they were in his position the day before were saying,
					"Indeed, it is God who spreads the bounty to whomever He wills of His servants,
					and restricts it. Had God not been gracious to us, He would have caved in on
					us. No wonder the ungrateful never prosper."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					That Home of the Hereafter-We assign it for those who seek no superiority on
					earth, nor corruption. And the outcome is for the cautious.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Whoever brings a virtue will receive better than it. But whoever brings
					evil-the evildoers will be rewarded only according to what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					He Who ordained the Quran for you will return you Home. Say, "My Lord knows
					best who comes with guidance, and who is in manifest error."
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					You did not expect the Scripture to be transmitted to you, except as mercy from
					your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter of the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					And do not let them divert you from God's revelations after they have been
					revealed to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be of the polytheists.
				-
			-
				Surah 28 - The Stories: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					And do not invoke with God any other god. There is no god but He. All things
					perish, except His presence. His is the judgment, and to Him you will be
					returned.

				-
					Alif, Lam, Meem.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					Have the people supposed that they will be left alone to say, "We believe,"
					without being put to the test?
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					We have tested those before them. God will surely know the truthful, and He
					will surely know the liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					Or do those who commit sins think they can fool Us? Terrible is their opinion!

					Those who believe and do righteous deeds-We will remit their sins, and We will
					reward them according to the best of what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					We have advised the human being to be good to his parents. But if they urge you
					to associate with Me something you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To
					Me is your return; and I will inform you of what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Those who believe and do good works-We will admit them into the company of the
					righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Among the people is he who says, "We have believed in God." Yet when he is
					harmed on God's account, he equates the people's persecution with God's
					retribution. And if help comes from your Lord, he says, "We were actually with
					you." Is not God aware of what is inside the hearts of the people?
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					God certainly knows those who believe, and He certainly knows the hypocrites.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Follow our way, and we will
					carry your sins." In no way can they carry any of their sins. They are liars.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					They will carry their own loads, and other loads with their own. And they will
					be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they used to

					But We saved him, together with the company of the Ark, and We made it a sign

			-
				-
					And Abraham, when he said to his people, "Worship God, and fear Him. That is
					better for you, if you only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					You worship idols besides God, and you fabricate falsehoods. Those you worship,
					instead of God, cannot provide you with livelihood. So seek your livelihood
					from God, and worship Him, and thank Him. To Him you will be returned."
				-
			-
				Surah 29 - The Spider: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					If you disbelieve, communities before you have also disbelieved. The Messenger

					Have they not seen how God originates the creation, and then reproduces it?

				Surah 31 - Luqman: Ayah 14
			-

					But if they strive to have you associate with Me something of which you have no

			-
				-
					Do you not see how God placed at your service everything in the heavens and the

				Surah 31 - Luqman: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					When waves, like canopies, cover them, they call upon God, devoting their

				-
			-
				Surah 31 - Luqman: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and dread a Day when no parent can avail

				-

				Surah 31 - Luqman: Ayah 34

			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve say, "The Hour will not come upon us." Say, "Yes indeed,

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 8

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Do they not reflect upon what lies before them and behind them, of the heaven

					And for Solomon the wind-its outward journey was one month, and its return

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 13

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Then, when We decreed death for him, nothing indicated his death to them except

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					In Sheba's homeland there used to be a wonder: two gardens, on the right, and

					land, and a forgiving Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					But they turned away, so We unleashed against them the flood of the dam; and We

				-

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 19
			-

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					Satan was correct in his assessment of them. They followed him, except for a

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					He had no authority over them; except that We willed to distinguish him who

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 22

			-
				-
					Those who disbelieve say, "We will never believe in this Quran, nor in what

					say to those who were arrogant, "Were it not for you, we would have been
					believers."
				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, "Was it us who

				-

				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, "It was your

					will put yokes around the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be repaid

				-
			-

				-
					We sent no warner to any town, without its affluent saying, "We reject what you

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					It is neither your wealth nor your children that bring you closer to Us, but it

				-

				-
					But those who work against Our revelations, seeking to undermine them-those

				-
					They will say, "Be You glorified; You are our Master, not them. In fact, they

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					"Today, none of you has the power to profit or harm the other." And We will say

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And when Our enlightening Verses are recited to them, they say, "This is

					But We gave them no book to study, and We did not send them any warner before

					Those before them also denied the Truth, yet they have not attained one-tenth

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Say, "I offer you a single advice: devote yourselves to God, in pairs, or

				-
			-
				Surah 34 - Saba: Ayah 47

					What of him whose evil deed was made attractive to him, and so he regards it as

				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 10
			-

					Whoever desires honor-all honor belongs to God. To Him ascends speech that is

				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					God created you from dust, then from a small drop; then He made you pairs. No

				-
					The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, sweet, good to drink, while the

				-
					And they will scream therein, "Our Lord, let us out, and we will act
					righteously, differently from the way we used to act." Did We not give you a
					life long enough, in which anyone who wanted to understand would have
					understood? And the warner did come to you. So taste. The evildoers will have
					no helper.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					God is the Knower of the future of the heavens and the earth. He knows what the
					hearts contain.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					It is He who made you successors on earth. Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief
					will recoil upon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to their
					Lord's disfavor of them. The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to their
					perdition.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Say, "Have you considered those partners of yours that you worship instead of
					God? Show me what they have created on earth. Or do they have any share in the
					heavens?" Or have We given them a book whose clear teachings they follow? In
					fact, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but delusions.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					God holds the heavens and the earth, lest they fall apart. And were they to
					fall apart, there is none to hold them together except He. He is Most Clement,
					Most Forgiving.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And they swore by God with their solemn oaths, that if a warner came to them,
					they would be more guided than any other people. Yet when a warner came to
					them, it only increased them in aversion.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Priding themselves on earth, and scheming evil. But evil scheming overwhelms
					none but its authors. Do they expect anything but the precedent of the
					ancients? You will not find any change in God's practice, and you will not find
					any substitute to God's practice.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Have they not journeyed in the land and observed the fate of those who preceded
					them? They were superior to them in strength. But nothing can defeat God in the
					heavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omniscient and Omnipotent.
				-
			-
				Surah 35 - The Angels: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					If God were to punish the people for what they have earned, He would not leave
					a single living creature on its surface. But He defers them until a stated
					time. Then, when their time has arrived-God is Observant of His creatures.

					You are one of the messengers.

			-
				-
					On a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					The revelation of the Almighty, the Merciful.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					To warn a people whose ancestors were not warned, and so they are unaware.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					The Word was realized against most of them, for they do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					We placed shackles around their necks, up to their chins, so they are
					stiff-necked.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					And We placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them, and We
					have enshrouded them, so they cannot see.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					It is the same for them, whether you warn them, or do not warn them-they will
					not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					You warn only him who follows the Message, and fears the Most Gracious
					inwardly. So give him good news of forgiveness, and a generous reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					It is We who revive the dead; and We write down what they have forwarded, and
					their traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear Record.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town-when the messengers
					came to it.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					We sent them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We reinforced them
					with a third. They said, "We are messengers to you."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					They said, "You are nothing but humans like us, and the Gracious did not send
					down anything; you are only lying."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					They said, "Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					And our only duty is clear communication."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					They said, "We see an evil omen in you; if you do not give up, we will stone
					you, and a painful punishment from us will befall you."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					They said, "Your evil omen is upon you. Is it because you were reminded? But
					you are an extravagant people."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					Then a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said, "my
					people, follow the messengers.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Follow those who ask you of no wage, and are themselves guided.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					"And why should I not worship Him Who created me, and to Whom you will be

				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If the Merciful desires harm for me,

				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					In that case, I would be completely lost.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					It was said, "Enter Paradise." He said, "If only my people knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					How my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honored."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					After him, We sent down no hosts from heaven to his people; nor would We ever
					send any down.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Alas for the servants. No messenger ever came to them, but they ridiculed him.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them; and
					that unto them they will not return?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					All of them, every single one of them, will be arraigned before Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					And there is a sign for them in the dead land: We give it life, and produce
					from it grains from which they eat.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And We place in it gardens of palm-trees and vines, and cause springs to gush
					out of it.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					That they may eat from its fruits, although their hands did not make it. Will
					they not be appreciative?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; of what the earth produces, and of
					their own selves, and of what they do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Another sign for them is the night: We strip the day out of it-and they are in
					darkness.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And the sun runs towards its destination. Such is the design of the Almighty,
					the All-Knowing.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					And the moon: We have disposed it in phases, until it returns like the old
					twig.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is the night to outpace the day. Each
					floats in an orbit.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden Ark.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And We created for them the like of it, in which they ride.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					If We will, We can drown them-with no screaming to be heard from them, nor will
					they be saved.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment for a while.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					Yet when it is said to them, "Beware of what lies before you, and what lies
					behind you, that you may receive mercy."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Yet never came to them a sign of their Lord's signs, but they turned away from
					it.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And when it is said to them, "Spend of what God has provided for you," those
					who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Shall we feed someone whom God could
					feed, if He so willed? You must be deeply misguided."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And they say, "When will this promise be, if you are truthful?"
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					All they can expect is a single blast, which will seize them while they feud.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					They will not be able to make a will, nor will they return to their families.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, they will rush from the tombs to their

				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					They will say, "Woe to us! Who resurrected us from our resting-place?" This is
					what the Most Gracious had promised, and the messengers have spoken the truth."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					It will be but a single scream; and behold, they will all be brought before Us.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the least, and you will be recompensed
					only for what you used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day, will be happily busy.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					They and their spouses, in shades, reclining on couches.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					They will have therein fruits. They will have whatever they call for.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Peace-a saying from a Most Merciful Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					But step aside today, you criminals.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Did I not covenant with you, O Children of Adam, that you shall not serve the
					devil? That he is your sworn enemy?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					And that you shall serve Me? This is a straight path.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					He has misled a great multitude of you. Did you not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					This is Hellfire, which you were promised.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Roast in it today, because you persistently disbelieved.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and
					their feet will testify to everything they had done.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					If We will, We can blind their eyes as they rush towards the path-but how will
					they see?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					And if We will, We can cripple them in their place; so they can neither move
					forward, nor go back.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					Whomever We grant old age, We reverse his development. Do they not understand?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					We did not teach him poetry, nor is it proper for him. It is only a reminder,
					and a Clear Quran.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					That he may warn whoever is alive, and prove the Word against the faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					Have they not seen that We created for them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that
					they own?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					And We subdued them for them. Some they ride, and some they eat.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					And they have in them other benefits, and drinks. Will they not give thanks?
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Yet they have taken to themselves gods other than God, that perhaps they may be
					helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					They cannot help them, although they are arrayed as troops for them.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					So let their words not sadden you. We know what they conceal, and what they
					reveal.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					Does the human being not consider that We created him from a seed? Yet he
					becomes a fierce adversary.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					And he produces arguments against Us, and he forgets his own creation. He says,
					"Who will revive the bones when they have decayed?"
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					Say, "He who initiated them in the first instance will revive them. He has
					knowledge of every creation."
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					He who produced fuel for you from the green trees, with which you kindle a
					fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Is not He who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of
					them? Certainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Creator.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					His command, when He wills a thing, is to say to it, "Be," and it comes to be.
				-
			-
				Surah 36 - Ya-seen: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					So glory be to Him in whose hand is the dominion of everything, and to Him you
					will be returned.

			-
				-
					When he came to his Lord with a sound heart.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					He said to his father and his people, "What are you worshiping?
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Is it falsified gods, instead of God, that you want?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					So what is your opinion about the Lord of the Worlds?"
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 88
			-
				-
					Then he took a glance at the stars.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 89
			-
				-
					And said, "I am sick."
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 90
			-
				-
					But they turned their backs on him, and went away.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Then he turned to their gods, and said, "will you not eat?
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 92
			-
				-
					What is it with you, that you do not speak?"
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 93
			-
				-
					Then he turned on them, striking with his right hand.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 94
			-
				-
					And they came running towards him.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 95
			-
				-
					He said, "Do you worship what you carve?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					When God created you, and what you manufacture?"
				-
			-

			-
				-
					They said, "Build a pyre for him, and throw him into the furnace."
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 98
			-
				-
					They wished him ill, but We made them the losers.

			-
				-
					"My Lord, give me one of the righteous."
				-
			-

			-
				-
					So We gave him good news of a clement boy.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 102
			-
				-
					Then, when he was old enough to accompany him, he said, "My son, I see in a

					as you are commanded; you will find me, God willing, one of the steadfast."
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 103
			-
				-
					Then, when they had submitted, and he put his forehead down.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					We called out to him, "Abraham!
				-
			-

			-
				-
					You have fulfilled the vision." Thus We reward the doers of good.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 106
			-
				-
					This was certainly an evident test.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 107
			-
				-
					And We redeemed him with a great sacrifice.
				-
			-
				Surah 37 - Those Who Set The Ranks: Ayah 108

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And We blessed him, and Isaac. But among their descendants are some who are

					"David, We made you a ruler in the land, so judge between the people with
					justice, and do not follow desire, lest it diverts you from God's path. Those
					who stray from God's path will have a painful punishment, for having ignored
					the Day of Account."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					We did not create the heaven and the earth and everything between them in vain.
					That is the assumption of those who disbelieve-so woe to those who disbelieve
					because of the Fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					Or are We to treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like those who make
					trouble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like the shameless?
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					A blessed Book that We sent down to you, that they may ponder its Verses, and
					for those with intelligence to take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					And We granted David, Solomon, an excellent servant. He was penitent.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					When the beautiful horses were paraded before him in the evening.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					He said, "I have preferred the love of niceties to the remembrance of my
					Lord-until it disappeared behind the veil.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Bring them back to me." And he began caressing their legs and necks.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					We tested Solomon, and placed a body on his throne; then he repented.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					He said, "My Lord, forgive me, and grant me a kingdom never to be attained by
					anyone after me. You are the Giver."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					So We placed the wind at his service, blowing gently by his command, wherever
					he directed.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					And the demons-every builder and diver.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And others fettered in chains.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					"This is Our gift; so give generously, or withhold; without account."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful resort.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					And mention Our servant Job, when he called out to his Lord, "Satan has
					afflicted me with hardship and pain."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					"Stamp with your foot-here is cool water to wash with, and to drink."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And We restored his family for him, and their like with them; as a mercy from
					Us, and a lesson for those who possess insight.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					"Take with your hand a bundle, and strike with it, and do not break your oath."
					We found him patient. What an excellent servant! He was obedient.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And mention Our servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-endowed with ability and
					vision.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					We distinguished them with a distinct quality: the remembrance of the Home.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					To Us they are among the chosen, the outstanding.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel; all are among the outstanding.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					This is a reminder. The devout will have a good place of return.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					The Gardens of Eden, with their doors wide-open for them.
				-

			-
				-
					Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant fruit and beverage.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					With them will be attendants with modest gaze, of same age.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					This is what you are promised for the Day of Account.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Such is Our bounty, inexhaustible.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					All This. But the transgressors will have a miserable return.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Hell; in which they will roast; what a miserable abode!
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					All this. Let them taste it-boiling and bitter cold.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					And similar torments of diverse kinds.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					"This is a crowd rushing headlong with you." There is no welcome for them. They
					will be scorched by the Fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					They will say, "But it is you! There is no welcome for you! It is you who
					brought it upon us! What a miserable end!"
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					They will say, "Our Lord, whoever brought this upon us, give him double torment
					in the Fire."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					And they will say, "What is it with us that we do not see men we used to count
					among the wicked?
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Did we take them for mockery, or have our eyes swerved from them?
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					This is certainly true-the feuding of the people of the Fire.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					Say, "I am only a warner, and there is no god except God-the One, the
					Conqueror.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them; the Mighty,
					the Forgiver."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					Say, "It is a message of great importance.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					From which you are turning away.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					I have no knowledge of the Highest Assembly as they dispute.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					It is only revealed to me that I am a clear warner."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					Your Lord said to the angels, "I am creating a human being from clay.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 72
			-
				-
					When I have formed him, and breathed into him of My spirit, fall prostrate
					before him.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 73
			-
				-
					So the angels fell prostrate, all of them.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Except for Satan. He was too proud, and one of the faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					He said, "Satan, what prevented you from prostrating before what I created with
					My Own hands? Are you too proud, or were you one of the exalted?"
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					He said, "I am better than he; You created me from fire, and You created him
					from clay."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					He said, "Then get out of here! You are an outcast!
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					And My curse will be upon you until the Day of Judgment."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					He said, "Lord, defer me until the Day they are resurrected."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					He said, "You are one of those deferred.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					Until the Day of the Time Appointed."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					He said, "By Your majesty, I will seduce them all.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					Except for your loyal servants among them."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					He said, "The truth is, and I say the truth.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					I will fill Hell with you, and with every one of them who follows you."
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 86
			-
				-
					Say, "I ask of you no wage for this, and I am not a pretender.
				-
			-
				Surah 38 - The Letter Sad: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					It is but a reminder to mankind.
				-

					And you will know its message after a while."

			-
				-
					In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.

				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 1
			-
				-
					The revelation of the Book is from God, the Mighty and Wise.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 2
			-
				-
					We sent down to you the Book with the truth, so serve God, devoting your
					religion to Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					Is not to God that sincere faith is due? As for those who take guardians
					besides Him, "We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to God." God
					will judge between them regarding their differences. God does not guide the
					lying blasphemer.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					If God wanted to have a son, He could have selected from His creation at will.
					Glory be to Him. He is God, the One, the Prevailing.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					He created the heavens and the earth with reason. He wraps the night around the
					day, and He wraps the day around the night. And He regulates the sun and the
					moon, each running along a specific course. He is indeed the Almighty, the
					Forgiver.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					He created you from one person, then made from it its mate, and brought down
					livestock for you-eight kinds in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your
					mothers, in successive formations, in a triple darkness. Such is God, your
					Lord. His is the kingdom. There is no god but He. So what made you deviate?
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					If you disbelieve, God is Independent of you, yet He does not approve
					ingratitude on the part of His servants. And if you are thankful, He will
					approve that in you. No bearer of burden can bear the burden of another. Then
					to your Lord is your return; and He will inform you of what you used to do. He
					is aware of what the hearts contain.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					When some adversity touches the human being, he prays to his Lord, repenting to
					Him. But then, when He confers on him a grace of His, he forgets what he was
					praying for before, and he attributes rivals to God, in order to lead astray
					from His way. Say, "Enjoy your disbelief for a little while; you will be among
					the inmates of the Fire."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Is he who worships devoutly during the watches of the night, prostrating
					himself and standing up, mindful of the Hereafter, and placing his hope in the
					mercy of his Lord? Say, "Are those who know and those who do not know equal?"
					Only those possessed of reason will remember.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Say, "My devotees who have believed, keep your duty to your Lord. For those who
					do good in this world, is goodness. And God's earth is vast. The steadfast will
					be paid their wages in full, without reckoning."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					Say, "I was commanded to serve God, devoting my religion exclusively to Him.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					And I was commanded to be the first of those who submit."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					Say, "I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the punishment of a horrendous Day."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Say, "It is God I worship, sincere in my faith in Him."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					"But you can worship whatever you wish besides Him." Say, "The losers are those
					who lose their souls and their people on the Day of Resurrection." That is
					indeed the obvious loss.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					They will have layers of Fire above them, and layers beneath them. That is how
					God strikes fear into His servants-"My servants! Beware of Me!"
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					As for those who avoid the worship of idols, and devote themselves to
					God-theirs is the good news. So give good news to My servants.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best of it. These are they whom
					God has guided. These are they who possess intellect.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					What about someone who has deserved the sentence of punishment? Is it you who
					can save those in the Fire?
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					But those who fear their Lord will have mansions upon mansions, built high,
					with streams flowing beneath them. The promise of God; and God never breaks a
					promise.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Have you not considered how God sends down water from the sky, then He makes it
					flow into underground wells, then He produces with it plants of various colors,
					then they wither and you see them yellowing, then He turns them into debris?
					Surely in this is a reminder for those with understanding.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					What about someone whose heart God has opened to Islam, so that he follows a
					light from His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the mention
					of God. Those are in manifest error.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					God has sent down the best of narrations: a Scripture consistent and paired.
					The skins of those who reverence their Lord shiver from it, then their skins
					and their hearts soften up to the remembrance of God. Such is God's guidance;
					He guides with it whomever He wills. But whomever God leaves astray, for him
					there is no guide.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					What about someone who covers his face against the terrible misery of the Day
					of Resurrection? To the evildoers it will be said, "Taste what you used to
					earn."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					Those before them also denied the truth, so the penalty came upon them from
					where they did not perceive.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					God made them taste disgrace in the present life, but the punishment of the
					Hereafter is worse, if they only knew.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					We have cited in this Quran for mankind every ideal, that they may take heed.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so they may become righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					God cites the example of a man shared by partners at odds, and a man belonging
					exclusively to one man. Are they equal in status? Praise be to God, but most of
					them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					You will die, and they will die.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be quarrelling before your Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Who is more evil than he who lies about God, and denies the truth when it has
					come to him? Is there not in Hell room for the ungrateful?
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					But he who promotes the truth, and testifies to it-these are the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					They will have whatever they please with their Lord. Such is the reward for the
					virtuous.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					God will acquit them of the worst of their deeds, and will reward them
					according to the best of what they used to do.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Is God not enough for His servant? And they frighten you with those besides
					Him. Whomever God sends astray, for him there is no guide.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					And whomever God guides, for him there is no misleader. Is God not Powerful and
					Vengeful?
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they would say,
					"God." Say, "Have you seen those you pray to instead of God? If God willed any
					harm for me, can they lift His harm? And if He willed a blessing for me, can
					they hold back His mercy?" Say, "God suffices for me. On Him the reliant rely."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Say: "my people, work according to your ability; and so will I. Then you will
					know.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Who will receive a humiliating punishment, and on whom will fall a lasting
					torment."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					We sent down upon you the Book for mankind in truth. He who follows guidance
					does so for the good of his soul. And he who strays in error does so to its
					detriment. You are not their overseer.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					God takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that have not died
					during their sleep. He retains those for which He has decreed death, and He
					releases the others until a predetermined time. In that are signs for people
					who reflect.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Or have they chosen intercessors other than God? Say, "Even though they have no
					power over anything, and are devoid of reason?"
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Say, "All intercession is up to God. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens
					and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					When God alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the
					Hereafter shrink with resentment. But when those other than Him are mentioned,
					they become filled with joy.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					Say, "Our God, Initiator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of all secrets
					and declarations. You will judge between your servants regarding what they had
					differed about."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					If those who did wrong owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it,
					they would redeem themselves with it from the terrible suffering on the Day of
					Resurrection. But there will appear to them from God what they never
					anticipated.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					There will appear to them the evils of their deeds, and they will be surrounded
					by what they used to ridicule.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					When adversity touches the human being, he calls on Us. But then, when We favor
					him with a blessing from Us, he says, "I have attained this by virtue of my
					knowledge." However, it is a test, but most of them do not know.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					Those before them said it, but what they had earned did not avail them.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					The evils of their deeds caught up with them. And the wrongdoers among these
					will also be afflicted by the evils of what they earned, and they cannot
					prevent it.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Do they not know that God extends the provision to whomever He wills, and
					constricts it? In that are signs for people who believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Say, "My servants who have transgressed against themselves: do not despair of
					God's mercy, for God forgives all sins. He is indeed the Forgiver, the
					Clement."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					And turn to your Lord, and submit to Him, before the retribution comes upon
					you. Then you will not be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord, before the
					punishment comes upon you suddenly, while you are unaware.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					So that a soul may not say, "How sorry I am, for having neglected my duty to
					God, and for having been of the scoffers."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Or say, "Had God guided me; I would have been of the pious."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Or say, when it sees the penalty, "If only I had another chance, I would be of
					the virtuous."
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you, but you called them lies, turned
					arrogant, and were of the faithless.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					On the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who told lies about God with
					their faces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell for the arrogant?
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					And God will save those who maintained righteousness to their place of
					salvation. No harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					God is the Creator of all things, and He is in Charge of all things.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					To Him belong the reins of the heavens and the earth. But those who blaspheme
					against the revelations of God-it is they who are the losers.
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					Say, "Is it other than God you instruct me to worship, you ignorant ones?"
				-
			-
				Surah 39 - The Troops: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					It was revealed to you, and to those before you, that if you idolize, your
					works will be in vain, and you will be of the losers.

				-
					They have not esteemed God as He ought to be esteemed. The entire earth will be

				-

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 4

					None argues against God's revelations except those who disbelieve. So do not be

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					Before them the people of Noah rejected the truth, as did the confederates

					And they argued with falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I seized them.
					What a punishment it was!
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 6

					Thus the sentence of your Lord became realized against those who disbelieve,

			-
				-
					Those who carry the Throne, and those around it, glorify their Lord with

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieved will be addressed, "The loathing of God is greater than

				-

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 11

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					That is because when God alone was called upon, you disbelieved; but when

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 13

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 18

					Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen the consequences for those

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 23

				-
					We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear authority.

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					Then, when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, "Kill the sons of

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 26
			-

					A believing man from Pharaoh's family, who had concealed his faith, said, "Are

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					O my people! Yours is the dominion today, supreme in the land; but who will

					prudence."
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					The one who had believed said, "my people, I fear for you the like of the day

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 31

					Like the fate of the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood, and those after

			-
				-
					O my people, I fear for you the Day of Calling Out.
				-
			-

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					Joseph had come to you with clear revelations, but you continued to doubt what
					he came to you with. Until, when he perished, you said, "God will never send a

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Those who argue against God's revelations, without any proof having come to
					them-a heinous sin in the sight of God, and of those who believe. Thus God

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					And Pharaoh said, "Hamaan, build me a tower, that I may reach the pathways.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					The pathways of the heavens, so that I may glance at the God of Moses; though I

					and he was averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was only in defeat.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 38
			-
				-

				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 40

					Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only with its like. But whoever works

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 41

					O my people, how is it that I call you to salvation, and you call me to the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					You call me to reject God, and to associate with Him what I have no knowledge

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Without a doubt, what you call me to has no say in this world, or in the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					You will remember what I am telling you, so I commit my case to God. God is

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					So God protected him from the evils of their scheming, while a terrible torment

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					The Fire. They will be exposed to it morning and evening. And on the Day the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, "We
					were followers of yours; will you then spare us a portion of the Fire?"
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					Those who were arrogant will say, "We are all in it; God has judged between the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, "Call to your Lord to

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					They will say, "Did not your messengers come to you with clear signs?" They

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					Most surely We will support Our messengers and those who believe, in this life,

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 52

			-
				-
					We gave Moses guidance, and made the Children of Israel inherit the Scripture.
				-

			-
				-
					A guide and a reminder for those endowed with reason.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 55

				-
					So be patient. The promise of God is true. And ask forgiveness for your sin,

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Those who dispute regarding God's revelations without any authority having come
					to them-there is nothing in their hearts but the feeling of greatness, which
					they will never attain. So seek refuge in God; for He is the All-Hearing, the
					All-Seeing.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor are those who believe and work

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no doubt about it; but most people do not

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					Your Lord has said, "Pray to Me, and I will respond to you. But those who are

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					It is God Who made the night for you, that you may rest therein; and the day

					thanks.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 62
			-
				-
					Such is God, your Lord, Creator of all things. There is no god except Him; so
					how could you turn away?
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 63
			-
				-
					Thus are turned away those who dispute the signs of God.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 64
			-
				-
					It is God who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure. And He
					designed you, and designed you well; and He provided you with the good things.
					Such is God, your Lord; so Blessed is God, Lord of the Worlds.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 65
			-
				-
					He is the Living One. There is no god except He. So pray to Him, devoting your

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 66
			-
				-
					Say, "I was prohibited from worshiping those you invoke besides God, now that
					clear revelations have come to me from my Lord; and I was commanded to submit
					to the Lord of the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 67
			-
				-
					It is He who created you from dust, then from a seed, then from an embryo, then
					He brings you out as an infant, then He lets you reach your maturity, then you
					become elderly-although some of you die sooner-so that you may reach a
					predetermined age, so that you may understand.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 68
			-
				-
					It is He who gives life and death; and when He decides on a thing, He just says
					to it, "Be," and it comes to be.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 69
			-
				-
					Have you not observed those who dispute regarding God's revelations, how they
					have deviated?
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 70
			-
				-
					Those who call the Book a lie, and what We sent Our messengers with-they will
					surely know.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 71
			-
				-
					When the yokes are around their necks, and they will be dragged by the chains.

			-
				-
					Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they will be consumed.
				-

				-
					Then it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to deify?
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 74
			-
				-
					Instead of God?" They will say, "They have abandoned us. In fact, we were
					praying to nothing before." Thus God sends the disbelievers astray.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 75
			-
				-
					That is because you used to rejoice on earth in other than the truth, and
					because you used to behave with vanity.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 76
			-
				-
					Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein forever. What a terrible dwelling

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 77
			-
				-
					So be patient. The promise of God is true. Whether We show you some of what We
					have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us they will be returned.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 78
			-
				-
					We sent messengers before you. Some of them We told you about, and some We did
					not tell you about. No messenger can bring a miracle except by leave of God.
					Then, when the command of God is issued, fair judgment will be passed, and
					there and then the seekers of vanity will lose.
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 79
			-
				-
					God is He who created the domestic animals for you-some for you to ride, and

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 80
			-
				-
					And in them you have other benefits as well, and through them you satisfy your

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 81
			-
				-
					And He shows you His signs. So which of God's signs will you deny?
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 82
			-
				-
					Have they not journeyed through the land, and seen the outcome for those before

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 83
			-
				-
					When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they rejoiced in the

				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 84
			-
				-
					Then, when they witnessed Our might, they said, "We believe in God alone, and
					we reject what we used to associate with Him."
				-
			-
				Surah 40 - The Forgiver: Ayah 85
			-
				-
					But their faith could not help them once they witnessed Our might. This has
					been God's way of dealing with His servants. And there and then the

					We had assigned companions for them, who glamorized to them what was in front

				-
			-
				Surah 41 - Explained In Detail: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Had We made it a Quran in a foreign language, they would have said, "If only

				-
			-
				Surah 41 - Explained In Detail: Ayah 45

				-
					To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit emerges from its sheath,

			-
				-
					And when We let him taste a mercy from Us, after the adversity that had

					them taste an awful punishment.
				-
			-
				Surah 41 - Explained In Detail: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					When We provide comfort for the human being, he withdraws and distances

				Surah 41 - Explained In Detail: Ayah 53

					As for those who take masters other than Him: God is in charge of them, and you

			-
				-
					Thus We inspired you with an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the Central City

				-
			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					Had God willed, He could have made them one community, but He admits into His

				-
			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 9

					Or have they adopted protectors besides him? But God is the Protector, and He

					Whatever matter you differ about, its judgment rests with God. "Such is God, my

				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 11
			-

					Originator of the heavens and the earth. He made for you mates from among

				-

				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 12

					To Him belongs absolute control of the heavens and the earth. He spreads the

				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					He prescribed for you the same religion He enjoined upon Noah, and what We
					inspired to you, and what We enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: "You

				-

				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					They became divided only after knowledge came to them, out of resentment among

					It is God who revealed the Book with the truth, and the Balance. And what will

					You will see the unjust terrified of what they have earned, and it will befall

				-

				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 23

					That is the good news God gives to His servants who believe and do good deeds.

					Or He could wreck them, because of what they have earned. And yet He pardons

					And those who, when wronged, defend themselves.

					Whoever God leaves astray has no protector apart from Him. And you will see the

				-
			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And you will see them exposed to it, cowering from disgrace, looking with

				-

					They will have no allies to support them against God. Whomever God leaves

			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					Respond to your Lord before there comes from God a Day that cannot be turned

				-
			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					But if they turn away-We did not send you as a guardian over them. Your only

					perpetrated, man turns blasphemous.
				-
			-
				Surah 42 - Council: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever

					It is not for any human that God should speak to him, except by inspiration, or

					I gave these and their forefathers some enjoyment, until the truth and a

			-
				-
					Is it they who allocate the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have allocated

					is better than what they amass.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Were it not that humanity would become a single community, We would have

				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And doors to their houses, and furnishings on which they recline.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but the stuff of this life. Yet the

					Whoever shuns the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We assign for him a devil,

					They hinder them from the path, though they think they are guided.

			-
				-
					Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, "If only there were between me and you

					Ask those of Our messengers We sent before you: "Did We appoint gods besides

				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					We sent Moses with Our revelations to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, "I
					am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds."
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					But when he showed them Our signs, they started laughing at them.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					Each sign We showed them was more marvelous than its counterpart. And We

				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					They said, "sorcerer, pray to your Lord for us, according to His pledge to you,

				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					But when We lifted the torment from them, they immediately broke their promise.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying, "my people, do I not own the
					Kingdom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath me? Do you not see?
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					Am I not better than this miserable wretch, who can barely express himself?
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on him, or they angels came with him in
					procession?"
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him. They were wicked people.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					And when they provoked Our wrath, We took retribution from them, and We drowned
					them all.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					Thus We made them a precedent and an example for the others.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					And when the son of Mary was cited as an example, your people opposed.
				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					They said, "Are our gods better, or he?" They cited him only for argument. In

				-
			-

			-
				-
					He was just a servant whom We blessed, and We made him an example for the

			-

					God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him-this is a straight path."

					But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the

			-
				-
					Are they only waiting for the Hour to come upon them suddenly, while they are

			-
				-
					On that Day, friends will be enemies of one another, except for the righteous.

			-
				-
					O My servants, you have nothing to fear on that Day, nor will you grieve.

			-
				-
					It will never be eased for them. In it, they will be devastated.

			-
				-
					We did them no injustice, but it was they who were the unjust.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					And they will cry, "Malek, let your Lord finish us off." He will say, "You are

					We have given you the truth, but most of you hate the truth.

			-
				-
					Have they contrived some scheme? We too are contriving.
				-
			-

				-
					Or do they think that We cannot hear their secrets and their conspiracies? Yes

			-
				-
					Say, "If the Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship."

			-
				-
					Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne,

			-
				-
					So leave them to blunder and play, until they encounter their Day which they

			-
				-
					It is He who is God in heaven, and God on earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.

			-
				-
					And blessed is He Who has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and what

					Those they invoke besides Him are incapable of intercession; only those who

				-
			-
				Surah 43 - Ornaments Of Gold: Ayah 87
			-
				-
					And if you asked them, "Who created them?", they would say, "God." Why then do

			-
				-
					Saying, "Hand over God's servants to me. I am an honest messenger to you."

					"Set out with My servants by night-you will be followed.

				-
					And plantations, and splendid buildings.

			-
				-
					Have you considered him who has taken his desire for his god? God has knowingly

				-

			-
				-
					When you encounter those who disbelieve, strike at their necks. Then, when you

				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					God was pleased with the believers, when they pledged allegiance to you under

				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 19

					And abundant gains for them to capture. God is Mighty and Wise.

				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					God has promised you abundant gains, which you will capture. He has expedited

				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 21

				-
					And other things, of which you were incapable, but God has encompassed them.

			-
				-
					If those who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned back and fled,

					It is God's pattern, ongoing since the past. You will never find any change in

				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					It is He who withheld their hands from you, and your hands from them, in the

				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					It is they who disbelieved, and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, and
					prevented the offering from reaching its destination. Were it not for faithful
					men and faithful women, whom you did not know, you were about to hurt them, and
					became guilty of an unintentional crime. Thus God admits into His mercy
					whomever He wills. Had they dispersed, We would have punished those who
					disbelieved among them with a painful penalty.
				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					Those who disbelieved filled their hearts with rage-the rage of the days of
					ignorance. But God sent His serenity down upon His Messenger, and upon the
					believers, and imposed on them the words of righteousness-of which they were
					most worthy and deserving. God is aware of everything.
				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					God has fulfilled His Messenger's vision in truth: "You will enter the Sacred
					Mosque, God willing, in security, heads shaven, or hair cut short, not fearing.
					He knew what you did not know, and has granted besides that an imminent
					victory."
				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, to

				-
			-
				Surah 48 - Victory: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Those with him are stern against the
					disbelievers, yet compassionate amongst themselves. You see them kneeling,
					prostrating, seeking blessings from God and approval. Their marks are on their
					faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah,
					and their description in the Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes strong,
					grows thick, and rests on its stem, impressing the farmers. Through them He
					enrages the disbelievers. God has promised those among them who believe and do
					good deeds forgiveness and a great reward.

				-

					And know that among you is the Messenger of God. Had he obeyed you in many

				-
					If two groups of believers fight each other, reconcile between them. But if one

			-
				-
					O you who believe! No people shall ridicule other people, for they may be
					better than they. Nor shall any women ridicule other women, for they may be
					better than they. Nor shall you slander one another, nor shall you insult one
					another with names. Evil is the return to wickedness after having attained

				-
			-
				Surah 49 - The Private Apartments: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					O you who believe! Avoid most suspicion-some suspicion is sinful. And do not

					is Most Relenting, Most Merciful.

					There is nothing to avert it.
				-

			-
				-
					Those who play with speculation.
				-
			-

					The Day when they are shoved into the Fire of Hell forcefully.
				-

			-
				-
					"This is the Fire which you used to deny.
				-
			-

					Is this magic, or do you not see?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 16

				-
					Burn in it. Whether you are patient, or impatient, it is the same for you. You

				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					But the righteous will be amid gardens and bliss.
				-

					Enjoying what their Lord has given them, and their Lord has spared them the

					Eat and drink happily, for what you used to do.

					Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and We will couple them with gorgeous

				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Those who believed, and their offspring followed them in faith-We will unite

					Every person is hostage to what he has earned.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					And We will supply them with fruit, and meat; such as they desire.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					They will exchange therein a cup; wherein is neither harm, nor sin.
				-

					Serving them will be youths like hidden pearls.
				-

			-
				-
					And they will approach one another, inquiring.
				-
			-

				-
					But God blessed us, and spared us the agony of the Fiery Winds.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is the Good, the Compassionate."
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you are neither a soothsayer, nor a

				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					Or do they say, "A poet-we await for him a calamity of time"?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					Say, "Go on waiting; I will be waiting with you."
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Or is it that their dreams compel them to this? Or are they aggressive people?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Or do they say, "He made it up"? Rather, they do not believe.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					So let them produce a discourse like it, if they are truthful.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they the creators?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they are not certain.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord? Or are they the controllers?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					Or do they have a stairway by means of which they listen? Then let their
					listener produce a clear proof.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					Or for Him the daughters, and for you the sons?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					Or do you demand a payment from them, and they are burdened by debt?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Or do they know the future, and they are writing it down?
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					Or are they planning a conspiracy? The conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					Or do they have a god besides God? God transcends what they associate.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					Even if they were to see lumps of the sky falling down, they would say, "A mass
					of clouds."
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					So leave them until they meet their Day in which they will be stunned.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					The Day when their ploys will avail them nothing; and they will not be helped.
				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					For those who do wrong, there is a punishment besides that; but most of them do

				-
			-
				Surah 52 - The Mount: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					So patiently await the decision of your Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and
					proclaim the praises of your Lord when you arise.
				-
			-

					And glorify Him during the night, and at the receding of the stars.

					Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he erred.

				-
					Nor does he speak out of desire.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					It is but a revelation revealed.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 6
			-

					The one of vigor. He settled.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					While he was at the highest horizon.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					Then he came near, and hovered around.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					He was within two bows' length, or closer.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					Then He revealed to His servant what He revealed.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					The heart did not lie about what it saw.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					Will you dispute with him concerning what he saw?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 13
			-
				-
					He saw him on another descent.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					Near which is the Garden of Repose.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					As there covered the Lotus Tree what covered it.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 17
			-
				-
					The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 18
			-
				-
					He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 19
			-
				-
					Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 20
			-
				-
					And Manat, the third one, the other?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 21
			-
				-
					Are you to have the males, and He the females?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 22
			-
				-
					What a bizarre distribution.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 23
			-
				-
					These are nothing but names, which you have devised, you and your ancestors,
					for which God sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and
					what the ego desires, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 24
			-
				-
					Or is the human being to have whatever he desires?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					To God belong the Last and the First.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 26
			-
				-
					How many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession avails nothing,
					except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 27
			-
				-
					Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels the names of females.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 28
			-
				-
					They have no knowledge of that. They only follow assumptions, and assumptions
					are no substitute for the truth.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 29
			-
				-
					So avoid him who has turned away from Our remembrance, and desires nothing but
					the present life.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 30
			-
				-
					That is the extent of their knowledge. Your Lord knows best who has strayed
					from His path, and He knows best who has accepted guidance.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 31
			-
				-
					To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. He will
					repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and recompense those who do
					good with the best.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 32
			-
				-
					Those who avoid gross sins and indecencies-except for minor lapses-your Lord is
					of Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever since He created you from the
					earth, and ever since you were embryos in your mothers' wombs. So do not
					acclaim your own virtue; He is fully aware of the righteous.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 33
			-
				-
					Have you considered him who turned away?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 34
			-
				-
					And gave a little, and held back?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 35
			-
				-
					Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, and can therefore foresee?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 36
			-
				-
					Or was he not informed of what is in the Scrolls of Moses?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 37
			-
				-
					And of Abraham, who fulfilled?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					That no soul bears the burdens of another soul.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 39
			-
				-
					And that the human being attains only what he strives for.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 40
			-
				-
					And that his efforts will be witnessed.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 41
			-
				-
					Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest reward.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 42
			-
				-
					And that to your Lord is the finality.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 43
			-
				-
					And that it is He who causes laughter and weeping.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 44
			-
				-
					And that it is He who gives death and life.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 45
			-
				-
					And that it is He who created the two kinds-the male and the female.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 46
			-
				-
					From a sperm drop, when emitted.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 47
			-
				-
					And that upon Him is the next existence.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 48
			-
				-
					And that it is He who enriches and impoverishes.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 49
			-
				-
					And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 50
			-
				-
					And that it is He who destroyed the first Aad.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 51
			-
				-
					And Thamood, sparing no one.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 52
			-
				-
					And the people of Noah before that; for they were most unjust and most
					oppressive.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 53
			-
				-
					And He toppled the ruined cities.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 54
			-
				-
					And covered them with whatever covered them.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 55
			-
				-
					So which of your Lord's marvels can you deny?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 56
			-
				-
					This is a warning, just like the first warnings.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 57
			-
				-
					The inevitable is imminent.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 58
			-
				-
					None besides God can unveil it.
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 59
			-
				-
					Do you marvel at this discourse?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 60
			-
				-
					And laugh, and do not weep?
				-
			-
				Surah 53 - The Star: Ayah 61
			-
				-
					Lost in your frivolity?
				-

					So bow down to God, and worship!

				-
					The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn away, and say, "Continuous magic."
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 3
			-
				-
					They lied, and followed their opinions, but everything has its time.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					And there came to them news containing a deterrent.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					Profound wisdom-but warnings are of no avail.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 6
			-
				-
					So turn away from them. On the Day when the Caller calls to something terrible.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 7
			-
				-
					Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge from the graves, as if they were
					swarming locusts.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 8
			-
				-
					Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbelievers will say, "This is a difficult
					Day."
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 9
			-
				-
					Before them the people of Noah disbelieved. They rejected Our servant, and
					said, "Crazy," and he was rebuked.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 10
			-
				-
					So he appealed to his Lord, "I am overwhelmed, so help me."
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 11
			-
				-
					So We opened the floodgates of heaven with water pouring down.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 12
			-
				-
					And We made the earth burst with springs, and the waters met for a purpose

			-
				-
					And We carried him on a craft of planks and nails.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 14
			-
				-
					Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him who was rejected.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 15
			-
				-
					And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone who would take heed?
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 16
			-
				-
					So how were My punishment and My warnings?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there anyone who would learn?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Aad denied the truth. So how were My punishment and My warnings?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					We unleashed upon them a screaming wind, on a day of unrelenting misery.
				-

			-
				-
					Plucking the people away, as though they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.

					They said, "Are we to follow one of us, a human being? We would then go astray,
					and end up in Hell.
				-
			-
				Surah 54 - The Moon: Ayah 25
			-
				-
					Was the message given to him, out of all of us? In fact, he is a wicked liar."

					The people of Lot rejected the warnings.

					A blessing from Us. Thus We reward the thankful.

				-

				-
					Are your unbelievers better than all those? Or do you have immunity in the

					The multitude will be defeated, and they will turn their backs.

					Then We sent in their wake Our messengers, and followed up with Jesus son of

					It is He who evicted those who disbelieved among the People of the Book from

					When Moses said to his people, "my people, why do you hurt me, although you

				Surah 61 - The Ranks: Ayah 6

					And when Jesus son of Mary said, "Children of Israel, I am God's Messenger to

					O you who believe! Be supporters of God, as Jesus son of Mary said to the

					It is He who sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves; reciting

					That is God's grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. God is Possessor of

				Surah 62 - The Congregation: Ayah 5
			-
				-
					The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but then failed to

				Surah 62 - The Congregation: Ayah 6

				-
					Say, "you who follow Judaism; if you claim to be the chosen of God, to the

				-
			-
				Surah 62 - The Congregation: Ayah 7

				Surah 62 - The Congregation: Ayah 11

				-

				Surah 63 - The Hypocrites: Ayah 4
			-
				-
					When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you

				-

				Surah 63 - The Hypocrites: Ayah 5

					And when it is said to them, "Come, the Messenger of God will ask forgiveness

				-
			-
				Surah 63 - The Hypocrites: Ayah 6

					It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask

				-
			-
				Surah 63 - The Hypocrites: Ayah 7

					It is they who say: "Do not spend anything on those who side with God's

				Surah 63 - The Hypocrites: Ayah 8

					O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of

					not evict them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have

					Once they have reached their term, either retain them honorably, or separate

					As for those of your women who have reached menopause, if you have any doubts,

					We will brand him on the muzzle.

					We tested them, as We tested the owners of the garden, when they vowed to

			-
				-
					Without any reservation.
				-

			-
				-
					"No poor person is to enter it upon you today."
				-
			-

			-
				-
					But when they saw it, they said, "We were wrong.
				-
			-

			-
				-
					We are now deprived."
				-
			-
				Surah 68 - The Pen: Ayah 28

			-
				-
					What is the matter with you? How do you judge?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Or do you have a scripture in which you study.
				-
			-
				Surah 68 - The Pen: Ayah 38
			-
				-
					Wherein there is whatever you choose?
				-
			-
				Surah 68 - The Pen: Ayah 39

				-
					Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until the Day of Resurrection, that you

					Ask them, which of them will guarantee that.

			-
				-
					So leave Me to those who reject this discourse; We will proceed against them

			-
				-
					And I will give them respite. My plan is firm.
				-

				-
					Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are burdened with debt?
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Or do they know the future, and so they write it down?
				-
			-
				Surah 68 - The Pen: Ayah 48

				-
					So wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord, and do not be like the Fellow

					Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it,
					or one-third of it, along with a group of those with you. God designed the
					night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has
					pardoned you. So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some
					of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God's
					bounty; and others fighting in God's cause. So read of it what is possible for
					you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend God a generous
					loan. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God,
					better and generously rewarded. And seek God's forgiveness, for God is
					Forgiving and Merciful.
