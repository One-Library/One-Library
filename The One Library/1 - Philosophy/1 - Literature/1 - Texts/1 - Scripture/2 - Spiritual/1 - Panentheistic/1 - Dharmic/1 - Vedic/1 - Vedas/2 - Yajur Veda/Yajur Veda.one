							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of
							the contest, deposited in Agni their desirable riches (thinking),'This
							will still be ours, if they defeat us. Agni desired it and went away
							with it. The gods having defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous
							of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept;
							in that he wept (arodit), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that
							prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of connexions
							himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the
							offspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should
							re-establish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is
							appeased. He should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the
							Naksatra for the re-establishing; verily by establishing it under its
							own deity he becomes resplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for
							variety. He establishes with Darbha; verily winning it from the waters
							and the plants he establishes it. The sacrificial cake is offered on
							five potsherds; the seasons are five; verily he wins it from the
							seasons and establishes it.

							He who removes the fire casts away the sacrifice and cattle. The

							Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods;
							Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the
							Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is
							fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the
							hero he re-establishes the fire does he win him. Now he who removes the
							fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor of
							the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven potsherds to Agni
							and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the recompense he
							delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined.

							Kasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their
							worn-out skins. With the verses of the queen of serpents he establishes
							the Garhapatya, and so renewing it he establishes it as immortal. Pure
							food did not come to the earth; she, he says, for sevenfold in
							seven-wise are the dear forms of Agni; verily he wins them. 'Return
							with strength', 'Return with wealth', (with these words) he offers
							oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with strength
							and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The Adityas
							went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder
							world, having returned to this world and having established the fire,
							they offered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the world of
							heaven. He, who establishes a fire after the second establishment,
							should offer these oblations; be prospers with the prosperity where
							with the Adityas prospered.

							There is no sacrifice without a Saman. 'As we approach the sacrifice',
							he says; verily he yokes a Stoma with it. 'Approach', he says;
							offspring and cattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle
							and offspring and this world. 'After his ancient splendour', he says;
							the ancient is the world of heaven; verily he mounts upon the world of
							heaven. 'Agni is the head of the sky, the height', he says; verily he
							makes him the head, he says; man lives a hundred years and has a
							hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. This is a pipe with
							projections; by it the gods made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras;
							in that he takes up the kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer
							hurls the hundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay
							(him) low without fail. 'Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of
							the sun', he says; 'that thou art, thus may I be', he says in effect.
							'Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun', he says; verily he

							they are greatness. 'Ye are might; may I share your might', he says,
							for they are might. 'Ye are strength; may I share your strength', he
							says, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. May we (set) thee
							around, O Agni, as a fort', he says; verily he sets around a barrier,
							that nothing be spilt. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says; that is
							according to the text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred
							winters may I kindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of
							his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. 'This blessing I invoke
							bringing light for the race', he should say, who has no son born;
							verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. 'This blessing I
							invoke bringing light for N. N.', he should say who has a son born;
							verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.

							He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer's own,
							that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is
							the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then
							grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours
							seed, and makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when
							poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many
							modifications of seed when poured the benediction of him who has
							established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire.
							Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he
							recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with
							the metres, he seeks to recover his own. 'There is not monotony then',
							they say, 'if one pays reverence day by day.' If a man pays reverence
							to the fire facing it, it burns him; if with averted (face), he is
							deprived of offspring and cattle; he should pay reverence with (face)
							somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn him, he is not
							deprived of offspring or cattle.

							Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new
							and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in
							competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not?
							He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices
							to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the
							gods, between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya
							pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates; he
							eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon
							himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he
							were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of
							water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra
							does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the
							enemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway
							smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 1: Chapter 6: Verse 8
					-
						-
							He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his
							sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with
							faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his
							sacrifice. They say, 'They foam over the barrier, they foam over
							speech, but over mind they do not foam.' He brings them forward with
							mind; mind is this (earth). Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods
							and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the
							taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he
							sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice.
							Now Prajapati performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the
							sacrifice with mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the
							sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the
							yokers. 'Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee', he says. Ka is
							Prajapati--verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the
							yokers.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 1: Chapter 6: Verse 9
					-
						-
							Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the
							full moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the
							Atiratra. These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the
							Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra
							that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the
							Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing
							thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the
							Ukthya he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump
							of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the
							wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the
							melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon
							sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an
							abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with
							pairings.

							'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily
							he makes them secure.' 'Thou art dread; may I be dread among my
							equals'; verily he makes them harmonious. 'Thou art overcoming; may I
							be overcoming among my equals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who
							rises against him. 'I yoke thee with the divine Brahman', he says; this
							is the yoking of the fire; verily, with mind and true existence do thou
							enter me', he says; mind is derived from Prajapati, the sacrifice is
							derived from Prajapati; verily he confers upon himself mind and the
							sacrifice. 'Thou art speech, derived from Indra, destroying the foe; do
							thou enter me with speech, with power', he says; speech is derived from
							Indra; verily he confers upon himself speech as connected with Indra.

							He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the
							sacrifice rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from
							the sacrifice. 'Do thou proclaim' has four syllables; 'Be it
							proclaimed' has four syllables; 'Utter' has two syllables; 'We that do
							utter' has five syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the
							seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows
							thus rests secure through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the
							sacrifice. He who knows the beginning, the support, the end of the
							sacrifice he confers the eating of food upon himself. 'Thou art a
							deceiver; may I be undeceived; may I deceive N. N.', he says; by that
							deceit the gods deceived the Asuras; verily by this he deceives his
							foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be a slayer of
							foes', he says; by means of Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra; verily by
							means of them he lays low his foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Indra and
							Agni, may I be powerful and an eater of food', he says; verily he
							becomes powerful and an eater of food. 'By sacrifice to the god Indra,
							may I be powerful', he says; verily he becomes powerful. 'By sacrifice
							to the god Mahendra, may I attain superiority and greatness', he says;
							verily he attains superiority and greatness. 'By sacrifice to the god
							Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying
							long life', he says; verily he confers long life upon himself and
							attains security through the sacrifice.

							Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established a fire.
							The cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the
							sacrifice between the fore- and the after-offerings. Over it as it is
							brought up he should say, 'O thou of fair rain colour, come hither';
							the cattle are the Ida; verily he summons cattle. The gods milked the
							sacrifice, the sacrifice milked the Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by
							the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who knowing the milking of the
							sacrifice sacrificial fee which he gives at the sacrifice his cattle
							accompany; he having sacrificed is like to become without cattle; 'the
							sacrificer must so arrange', they say, 'that he may place among the
							gods what is given, but keep his cattle with himself.' 'Swell, O ruddy
							one', he says; the ruddy one is the sacrifice; verily he magnifies the
							sacrifice; thus he places among the gods what is given, but keeps his
							cattle with himself. 'May (my act) as I give be not destroyed', he
							says; verily he avoids destruction; 'May (my act) as I work not
							perish', he says; verily he attains prosperity.

							Samçravas Sauvarcanasa said to Tumiñja Aupoditi: 'When thou hast been a
							Hotr of Sattrins, what Ida hast thou invoked?' 'Her I have invoked', he
							said, 'who supports the gods by her expiration, men by her
							cross-breathing, and the Pitrs by her inspiration.' 'Does she divide,
							or does she not divide' (he asked). 'She divides', he replied. 'Her
							body then hast thou invoked', he said. Her body is the cow, this
							(earth) supports people in distress and succours them as they improve;
							he who knows thus finds support. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'in
							whose step people drink the ghee they live upon.' 'Does she divide, or
							does she not divide?' (he asked). 'She does not divide', he said, 'but
							she propagates.' 'Indeed hast thou invoked the Ida herself ', he
							replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of rain people drink the ghee
							they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated with offspring; he
							becomes an eater of food.

							Secretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The
							gods who receive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in
							sacrifice; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess--the Brahmans are the
							gods openly--them he verily delights. This is his sacrificial fee:
							verily he mends the rent in the sacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is
							harsh or is injured, that he makes good (anvaharati), he says; verily
							he unites Prajapati with his own portion. 'Full of strength and milk',
							he says; verily he confers upon him strength and milk. 'Protect my
							expiration and inspiration; protect my breathing together and
							cross-breathing', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'Thou art
							imperishable, for imperishableness thee; mayst thou not perish for me,
							yonder, in yonder world', he says. Food perishes in yonder world, for
							given hence in yonder world people live upon it; in that he touches
							thus, he makes it imperishable; his food perishes not in yonder world.

							'By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children',

							offspring. 'By sacrifice to the god Naraçansa, may I be possessed of
							cattle', he says; by Naraçansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he
							creates cattle. 'By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain
							security through the sacrifice, having long life', he says; verily he
							confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With
							the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices, may I impregnate
							seed', he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed
							upon himself. 'By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form
							of cattle'; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and
							thereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. 'The wives of the
							gods, Agni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by
							sacrifice to these deities may I be propagated with a pair.' 'Thou art
							the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain', he says; by the bundle (vedena)
							the gods won (avindanta) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that
							is why the bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe's he may covet, the
							name of that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. 'May the
							bundle bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a
							thousandfold, strong', he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his
							offspring a strong one is born who knows thus.

							Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through
							the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through
							the swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
							sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Let the
							Dhruva swell with ghee', he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell;
							through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
							sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuo - h the sacrificer offspring.
							'Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with
							the sacrificer', he says. He goes to the bath along with the creatures
							which attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won
							these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes
							the steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by
							the metres so as to be irrecoverable. 'Thou art the step of Visnu,
							smiting imprecations', he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the
							atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the
							quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins
							these worlds in order.

							low', he says; that is according to the text. 'Thou art good, the best
							of rays; thou art life-bestowing, bestow life upon me', he says; verily
							he invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who, for
							atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not
							back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it
							does turn back; 'The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being',
							he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he
							restores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having
							established a fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a
							Brahman. Having sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say,
							'Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer'; he
							wins his retinue, he obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a

							The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases,
							and Piçacas on the other. Of the gods the little blood they drew the
							Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and
							dead. The gods understood, 'Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who
							kill.' They invited the Raksases; they said, 'Let us choose a boon;
							what, to Agni with the face. In that he offers to Agni, the forward, he
							repels thereby the foe who is superior to him; in that (he offers) to
							Agni, the overcomer, he repels thereby (the foe) who is equal to him;
							in that (he offers) to Agni with the face, he repels thereby the foe
							which is inferior to him. He repels the foe who is superior, he
							surpasses him who is like, the inferior does not equal him who knowing

							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods said, 'Let us hold

							from tribulation; this is that which drives away the foe; this is that
							which has power' if no foe; in that (he offers) to Indra, the driver
							away of the foe, he smites away thereby his foes; in that (he offers)
							to Indra, the powerful, he bestows thereby power upon himself; he
							offers a cake on thirty-three potsherds; the gods are thirty-three;

							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Gayatri, grasping and

							therefore they style this offering the gatherer. He who has foes should
							in conflict sacrifice with this offering. To Agni, the gatherer, he

							'Thou art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts',
							(with these words) he puts on a black garment with a black fringe; that
							is the hue of rain; verily becoming of like hue he causes Parjanya to
							rain. 'Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon', (with these words) he
							pushes back the west wind; verily he produces the east wind, to win the
							rains. He makes offering to the names of the wind; the wind rules the
							rain; verily he has recourse to the wind with its own share; verily it
							makes Parjanya rain for him. Eight offerings he makes them move
							forward. Thou art the fetter of the strong horse; for rain I yoke
							thee', he says the horse is strong, Parjanya is strong; becoming black
							as it were he rains; verily he unites him with his hue, to win the
							rains.

							'O gods having wealth, O gods granting protection, O gods drinking

							he daily seeks rain. If it should rain, so much only should be offered;
							if it should not rain, on the next day he should offer an oblation.
							Mitra and Varuna are day and night, by day and night Parjanya rains,
							for by night or by day he rains; verily he has recourse to Mitra and
							Varuna with their own share; verily they make Parjanya rain for him;
							even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. 'Let free the rain from
							heaven; with waters fill the ocean', he says; verily these and yonder
							waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters). 'Thou
							art born of waters, first-born; thou art the might of the ocean', he
							says; that is according to the text. 'Flood the earth', (with these
							words) he offers in a Boerhavia procumbens; this of plants is that
							which wins rain, and thereby he causes rain to fall. 'The gods whose
							portion is in the sky', (with these words) he shakes the black antelope
							skin; verily to him these worlds become dear and desired.

							metres. The Usnih is the Gayatri; the four syllables over are
							fourfooted cattle; just as cake is over cake, so it is with the
							syllables which are over the verse; if he were to close with a Jagati;
							he gives the silken garment; verily he wins cattle; he gives a cow;
							verily he wins his prayers; gold is the colour of the Saman, the silken

							Tvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an
							invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), 'Thou hast
							slain my son.' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly
							drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya
							(fire), saying, 'Hail! wax great, Indra's foe. While (the fire) was
							flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed; whether so
							much was before knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him;
							he accepted it, and (saying), 'Thrice hast thou furthered me', gave it
							to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), 'Let Indra place power in us.' In
							that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the
							threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he
							gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu.
							Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the
							Yajuses. A thousand he gave to him; therefore there are a thousand

							The gods were afraid of the warrior on his birth. While still within

							continually slay his foes', one should offer for him the offering for
							Indra and Brhaspati, for the warrior is connected with Indra, Brhaspati
							is the holy power (Brahman); verily by the holy power (Brahman) he
							frees him from the bond that fetters him. The sacrificial present is a

								Viçvarupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and
								the sister's son of the Asuras. He had three heads, one which drank
								Soma, one Sura, and one which ate food. He promised openly the
								share to the gods, secretly to the Asuras. Men promise openly the
								share to every one; if they promise any one secretly, his share is
								indeed promised. Therefore Indra was afraid (thinking), 'Such an
								one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).' He took his bolt and
								smote off his heads. (The head) which drank Soma anoints herself
								has a skin disease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is
								bald and feeble; (the son born) of one who anoints (her eyes) is
								blind; (the son born) of one who cleans her teeth has dirty teeth;
								(the son born) of one who cuts her nails has bad nails; (the son
								born) of one who spins is a eunuch; (the son born) of one who
								weaves ropes is unrestrained; (the son born) of one who drinks from
								a leaf is drunken; (the son born) of one who drinks from a
								mutilated (vessel) is mutilated. For three nights he should keep a
								vow and should drink from his hand or from a perfect vessel, to
								guard his offspring.

							Tvastr, his son being slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra
							desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying)
							'Thou hast slain my son.' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and
							forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the
							Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), 'Hail! wax great, Indra's foe.' In that he
							cast it (avartayat), Vrtra is Vrtra; in that he said, 'Hail! wax great,
							Indra's foe', therefore, 'Let me choose a boon; ye shall feed off both
							when they are in me.' The cow brought the (brilliance); therefore they
							feed off both things that are in the cow; ghee indeed is the brilliance
							of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma. He who knows thus the brilliance
							of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say, 'What is the
							deity of the full moon (rite)?' He should reply, 'Prajapati; by means
							of it he established his eldest son, Indra.' Therefore they establish
							their eldest sons with wealth.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 2: Chapter 5: Verse 3

							When Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this
							enemy-dispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full
							moon. He offered it, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the
							enemy-dispelling (oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full
							moon, the sacrificer by it drives away his enemies. Indra, having slain
							Vrtra, lost the gods and his power. He saw the (offering) to Agni on
							eight potsherds at the new moon, and the curds for Indra dwells', for
							Indra is the treasure of the gods, and that is why the new moon night
							has its name (ama-vasya), 'home dwelling'). The theologians say, What
							is the deity of the Samnayya?' 'The All-gods', he should reply, for so
							the All-gods won that as their share.' Or rather he should reply,
							'Indra, for it was in healing Indra that they won it.'
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 2: Chapter 5: Verse 4
					-
						-
							The theologians say, 'He would indeed offer the new and full moon
							(sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.' At the full moon there
							is the subsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by
							it the full moon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon;
							verily the new moon has Indra. He who knowing thus offers,' the new and
							full moon sacrifices, offers them with Indra, and day after day it
							becomes better for him who has so sacrificed. What the gods did at the
							sacrifice, the Asuras did. The gods his own deity, being sacrificed to,
							kindles him with prosperity and he becomes richer. After the year he
							should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, lord of vows; verily
							for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take up the vow who has
							slain his foe (vrtra). Thereafter he may sacrifice at will.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 2: Chapter 5: Verse 5

							No one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the
							milk of him who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who
							is not a Soma sacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does
							wrong, and (his milk) is poured forth in vain. A Soma sacrificer only
							should offer the Samnayya. Soma is milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily
							with milk he places milk in himself. The moon deprives him of offspring
							and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on whose sacrifice when
							offered it rises in the east. Just as a great man who has attained
							(fortune) desires (and does), so he does. If he misses the mark he
							becomes worse; if he does not, he remains the same. One who desires
							distinction should sacrifice with it, for this sacrifice has a razor
							edge, and swiftly he becomes holy or perishes. His vow is: he shall not
							speak untruth; be shall not eat meat; he shall not approach for all a
							woman; they shall not clean his raiment with cleansing stuff; for all
							these things the gods do not do.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 2: Chapter 5: Verse 6

							The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the chariot of the gods. He,
							who having offered the new and the full moon (sacrifices) Sacrifices
							with Soma, rests in the chosen resting-place of the gods which is
							conspicuous for its chariot (tracks). The new and the full moons are
							the limbs and joints of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new
							and the full moon (sacrifices) thus unites the limbs and joints of the
							year. The new and the full moon are the eyes of the year; he who
							knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus sees
							with them along the world of heaven; from us let the gods be sacrificed
							to.' Therefore of the series of nights it is on the new and the full
							moon night that the gods are sacrificed to; for they are the appointers
							of portions for the gods. Men appoint portions to him who knows thus.
							Creatures slew hunger, man at once, the gods at the half-month, the
							Pitrs in a month, trees in a year. Therefore day by day men desire
							food, at the half-month the gods are sacrificed to, every month
							offering is made to the Pitrs, in a year trees produce fruit. He who
							knows thus slays the enemy, hunger.

							The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could
							they rest. He makes the noise 'Him'; verily he makes the Saman. He
							makes the noise 'Him'; where the gods rested, there he sets them in
							motion. He makes the noise 'Him'; this is the yoking of speech. He
							makes the noise 'Him'; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He
							repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the
							end of the sacrifice. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his
							inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the
							Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this
							is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his
							elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were
							not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer's
							offspring and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects
							them together, and being so connected and secured they yield him all
							his desires.

							Without a Saman there is no sacrifice. 'O Agni, come hither for the

							the kindling-sticks, O Angiras', he says; this is the character of the
							Vamadevya. 'The great and powerful one, O Agni', he says. This is the
							character of the Brhat. In that he repeats this Trca, he makes the
							sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder world, the sun in this; these
							worlds were disturbed. 'Choose ye the bearer of the oblation', he says;
							'let him choose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi's
							family; verily he departs not from the connexion, (and so it serves)
							for continuity. He chooses, beginning at the further end, in order of
							descent; therefore the Pitrs drink after men in order of descent,
							beginning at the further end.

							kindled him. 'Kindled by Manu', he says, for Manu kindled him after the
							gods. 'Praised by the Rsis', he says, for the Rsis praised him.
							'Rejoiced in by sages', he says. If he were to say two as it were, he
							would produce an enemy for him. 'Take, Adhvaryu, the spoon (sruc) with
							ghee', he says; verily by it he causes the sacrificer to wax great.
							'Pious', he says, for he aids the gods, 'With all boons', he says, for
							he aids all. 'Let us praise the gods worthy of praise; let us honour
							those worthy of honour; let us sacrifice to those worthy of sacrifice',
							he says. Those worthy of praise are men; those worthy of honour are the
							Pitrs; those worthy of sacrifice are the gods; verily he sacrifices to

							sorts of men are there besides the warrior, the Brahman, Vaiçya and
							Çudra; verily he makes them obedient to him. He should repeat fifteen
							(Samidhenis) in the case of a Rajanya; the Rajanya is fifteenfold;
							verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. Let him surround it
							with a Tristubh; the Tristubh is power, the Rajanya sacrifices in
							desire of power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. If he
							desires. He should repeat forty-four for one who desires power, the
							Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily by the
							Tristubh he secures power for him. He should repeat forty-eight for one
							who desires cattle; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are
							connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he secures cattle for
							him. He should repeat all the metres for one who makes many sacrifices,
							for all the metres are won by him who makes many sacrifices. He should
							repeat indefinitely to win that which is not definite.

								The thread is worn around the neck for men, over the right shoulder
								for the Pitrs, over the left for the gods. He puts it over the left
								shoulder; verily he makes the mark of the gods. He repeats
								standing, for standing he speaks more audibly. He repeats standing,
								to conquer the world of heaven. He sacrifices sitting; verily he
								finds support in this world. In that he repeats in the Krauñca,
								note, that is connected with the Asuras, in the low note, that is
								connected with men, in the intermediate note, that is connected
								with the gods. One should repeat in the intermediate note, to
								secure the gods. Clever indeed; verily also the world of the gods
								and the world of men he conquers.

								The gods having repeated the Samidhenis could not see the
								sacrifice. Prajapati in silence performed the sprinkling of the
								butter. Then indeed did the gods see the sacrifice. In that he
								silently sprinkles, (it serves) to light up the sacrifice. Verily
								also he anoints the kindling-sticks. He who knows thus becomes
								soft. Verily also he delights them. He delights in offspring and
								cattle prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man, who knows thus
								and for whom they chose his list of ancestors, prospers himself,
								his enemy is defeated. If a Brahman and a non-Brahman have a
								litigation, one should support the Brahman; if one supports the
								Brahman, one supports oneself; if one opposes the Brahman, one
								opposes oneself therefore one should not oppose a Brahman.

							He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he wins spring among the

							offers to the oblations; verily he wins the rains. He offers to the
							sacrificial strew, verily lie wins autumn. He offers with the cry of
							'Hail!'; verily he wins the winter. Therefore in winter animals over
							which the cry of 'Hail!' is raised perish. He offers to the
							kindling-sticks; verily he wins the dawns of the goddesses. He offers
							to Tanunapat; verily he wins the sacrifice. Therefore they say, who
							know it or who know not, 'How is it the son's only, how is the father's
							common?' That which spills when the fore-sacrifices are offered is not
							really spilt. The Gayatri conceives through it, and produces offspring

							The two portions of the oblation are the eyes of the sacrifice. In that
							he offers the two portions of the oblation, he inserts the two eyes of
							the sacrifice. He offers in the front place; therefore the eyes are in
							front. He offers evenly; therefore the eyes are even. By Agni the
							sacrificer discerns the world of the gods, by Soma the world of the
							Pitrs; in the north part he offers to Agni, in the south to Soma, for
							these worlds are thus, as it were, to illumine these worlds. Agni and
							Soma are the kings of the gods establishes him with the Vasat call. The
							Puronuvakya has three feet; these worlds are three; verily he finds
							support in these worlds. The Yajya has four feet; verily he wins four
							footed cattle. The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two
							feet; verily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is
							the Gayatri, the Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted
							Çakvari. Whatever the gods were fain to do by it, that they were able
							to do; he who knows thus can do whatever he is fain to do.

							Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods. He placed in himself the

							the oblation, let them pour out (a layer), let them sprinkle (it).'
							Therefore they offer the portions of the oblation, they pour out (a
							layer), and sprinkle (it). The theologians say, 'For what reason are
							the other offerings worn out, but the oblation fresh?' He should reply,
							'Because it is Prajapati's. If it be lost, be should make an offering
							on two potsherds to the Açvins, and on one potsherd to sky and earth.
							The Açvins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them he heals it.
							Then is offered an offering on one potsherd to sky and earth; in them

							restraint. 'Thou art a hundred-edged, of the tree, slayer of the foe',
							he says; verily he sharpens the bolt, being about to hurl it at his
							enemy. He throws away the grass with a Yajus. The earth is the size of
							the altar; verily he deprives his enemy of so much of that in making an
							altar. (With the words) 'Thou art the holder, thou art the self
							holder', it is made smooth, for healing. He places the sprinkling
							waters; the waters are Raksas-slaying; (verily they serve) for slaying
							the Raksases. He places them in the path made by the sword, for the
							continuity of the sacrifice. He should think of any one whom he hates;

							The theologians say, 'Thou hast sprinkled the offerings with water; but

							for verily he sprinkles the offerings with water, and the waters with
							the holy power (Brahman). He sprinkles the kindling-wood and the
							sacrificial strew; verily he makes it pure. He sprinkles the altar, the
							altar was rough, hairless, and impure; verily he makes it pure. 'To the
							sky thee, to the atmosphere thee, to earth thee', (with these words) he
							places the sacrificial strew and sprinkles it go to the world of
							heaven. The sacrificer is rent in that they smooth the bundle; he
							throws the strew along after it, for calming. The Adhvaryu has no
							support, and he is liable to be seized by shivering. (With the words),
							'Thou art firm (dhruva)', he strokes it; the Dhruva is this (earth);
							verily he finds support in it, and shivers not. 'Has he gone, O Agnidh?
							he says. If (the Agnidh) were to say, 'Agni has gone?' he would make
							Agni go into the fire, and exclude the sacrificer from the world of
							heaven. So he should say only 'Has he gone?' Verily he makes the
							sacrificer go to the world of heaven.

							Agni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the

							start him up. The fish proclaimed him, and he cursed it, 'At Pleasure
							may they slay thee, since thou hast proclaimed me.' So they slay the
							fish at pleasure, for he is cursed quarter; verily he appeases Rudra in
							his own quarter. He sprinkles it twice, to make it divided into four.
							The former offerings are cattle, Agni is Rudra here; if he were to pour
							over the former offerings, he would give Rudra cattle, and the
							sacrificer would be without cattle. He offers leaving the former
							oblations aside, to protect the cattle.

							therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. 'The
							Rathantara is invoked with the earth', he says, he says. The highest
							sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine
							abode is the world of heaven. (With the words), 'Thou art this; thou
							art this', he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. 'All that is
							dear to it is invoked', he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.

							Food is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his

							'Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat', he says; verily he delights
							speech with a share. 'Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat', he
							says, for completion.' (The food) is divided. in four; what is divided
							in four is the offering, what is divided in four is cattle; if the Hotr
							were to eat it, the Hotr would, 'It will harm me when I have eaten.'
							'With the belly of the Brahman', he said, for nothing harms the belly
							of the Brahman. 'With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati', (he
							said), for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths
							indeed depart from him who eats this offering; by purifying it with
							water he grasps the breaths; the breaths are ambrosia, the waters
							ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths according to their places.

							He takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose

							each once, for the sacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes
							up four, cattle are four-footed; verily he wins cattle. 'O Brahman,
							will we set out?' he says; there indeed is the sacrifice placed. 'Agni
							shall win, god, from the gods, we men from Agni', he says, 'Agni wins
							from the gods, we from men', he says in effect. 'Here is the path of
							favour, and this our homage to the gods', he says; to both the gods
							whom he sacrifices to and those to whom he does not sacrifice, he pays
							homage, for his own security.

							The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the
							sacrifice. They spoke to Çamyu Barhaspatya, 'Perform the Svaga call at
							this sacrifice for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon; if a faithless
							man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the
							blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.' Therefore if a faithless man
							sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of
							such a sacrifice goes to Çamyu Barhaspatya. 'That is mine', he said,
							'What is to belong to my offspring? in that the fore-sacrifices are
							offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with
							butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he
							offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The
							sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered
							five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth
							is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an
							end.

							Prajapati desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance, he created
							serpents. He desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance a second
							time, he created birds. He desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did
							penance a third time, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke
							it. Then indeed did he create offspring. In that after undergoing
							penance he speaks the speech of the consecrated, the sacrificer thus.
							'From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati be thy forerunner',
							he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily he
							grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. 'Here we have
							come (a-idam) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods', he
							says, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices.
							'Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced', he says, for all the gods
							delight in it, in that the Brahmans so do. 'Accomplishing (the rite)
							with Rc, Saman, and Yajus', he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes
							(the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus. 'Let us rejoice in fullness of
							wealth, in sustenance', he says; verily he invokes this blessing.

								He who purchases King Soma after making it go to the world of
								lordship, becomes lord of his own (people). The world of lordship
								of King Soma is the metres; he should utter these verses before the
								purchase of Soma. It is to the world of lordship that he makes it
								go when he buys (Soma) possession is the beaker. If he were to call
								without holding the Vayu cup or the beaker, he would lose his own;
								therefore he must hold it when he calls; verily he loses not his
								own. If he begins the litany without placing the Soma," the Soma is
								not supported, the Stoma is not supported, the hymns are not
								supported, the sacrificer is not supported, the Adhvaryu is not
								supported. The support of the Soma is the Vayu cup, the support of
								it is the beaker, (the support) of the Stoma is Soma, (the support)
								of the hymns is the Stoma. He should grasp the cup or fill up the
								beaker, and then begin the litany; a support to the Soma he verily
								(eva) gives, to the Stoma, to the hymns; the sacrificer finds
								support, the Adhvaryu finds support.

							They gather together the sacrifice when (they gather the dust of) the
							foot-print of the Soma cow; the oblation-holders are the mouth of the
							sacrifice; when they move forward the oblation-holders, then he should
							oil the axle with it; verily he extends the sacrifice in the mouth of
							the sacrifice. They lead Agni forward, they take the wife forward, and
							they make the carts follow after. Now the altar of him (Agni) is
							deserted; he broods on it, and is liable to become terrible (rudrá),
							and lay to rest the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. When they
							are leading northward the sacrificial animal over which the Apris have
							been said, he should take (from the altar the fire) for cooking it;
							verily he makes him share in it. The Ahavaniya is the sacrificer; if
							they take (the fire) for cooking the victim from the Ahavaniya, they
							tear the sacrificer asunder; the fire should therefore be thus, or he
							should make it by friction, so that the sacrificer's body may remain
							together. If a portion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an
							equivalent portion of the butter; that is then the atonement. If men
							disturb his victim and he wish of them, 'May they come to ruin', he
							should make an offering in the Agnidh's altar with the Rc containing
							the word 'paying of homage' (and beginning), 'What then?' Verily he
							appropriates their paying of homage and speedily do they go to ruin.

							Cattle belong to Prajapati; their overlord is Rudra. In that he

							support. Having prepared them, he offers five libations; cattle are
							fivefold; I verily he wins cattle. Now the victim is led to death, and
							if he should lay hold on it, the sacrificer would be likely to die. '
							The breath of the sacrifice is apart from the victim', he says, for
							distinction. 'If the victim has uttered a cry'--(with these words) he
							offers a libation, for calming. 'O ye slayers, come to the sacrifices',
							he says; that is according to the text. When the omentum. is being
							taken, the strength goes away from Agni. 'Thee they keep to carry the
							offering'--(with these words) he pours a libation over the omentum;
							verily he wins the strength of Agni; (it serves) also for making (the
							victim) ready. In the case of some gods the cry of 'hail!' is uttered
							before (an offering), in the case of others the cry of 'hail!' is
							uttered after. 'Hail to the gods, to the gods hail!'--(with these
							words) he pours a libation on either side of the omentum; verily he

								Manu divided his property among his sons. He deprived
								Nabhanedistha, who was a student, of any portion. He went to him,
								and said, 'How hast thou deprived me of a portion?' He replied, 'I
								have not deprived you of a portion; the Angirases here are
								performing a Sattra; they to me.' They have not the power to do
								that', he replied, (whatever is left on the place of sacrifice is
								mine.' Then one should not resort to a place of sacrifice. He said,
								'Give me a share in the sacrifice, and I will not have designs
								against your cattle. He poured out for him the remnants of the
								mixed (Soma). Then indeed had Rudra no designs against his cattle.
								When one who knows thus offers the remnants of the mixed (Soma),
								Rudra has no designs against his cattle.

							He who sacrifices knowing the 'ascent' verses of the Pavamana (Stotras)

							over in safety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I
							grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the
							Jagati for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety', he says.
							These, and with its being split the breath of the Adhvaryu would be

								Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw
								this great sacrifice, they extended it, they performed the
								Agnihotra as the vow; therefore one should perform the vow twice,
								for twice they offer the Agnihotra. They performed the full moon
								rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni and Soma. They performed the
								new moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni. They performed the
								sacrifice to the All-gods as the morning pressing. They performed
								the Varunapraghasas, as the midday pressing. They performed the
								Sakamedhas, the sacrifice to the fathers, and the offering to
								Tryambaka, as the third pressing. The Asuras sought to follow their
								sacrifice, but could not get on its tracks. They said, 'These gods
								have become inviolable (adhvartavyah). That is why the sacrifice
								(adhvara) is inviolable. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were
								defeated. He who knowing thus offers the Soma, prospers himself,
								the enemy is defeated.

									likely to die; if a dog touch it, his fourfooted cattle would
									be likely to die; if it were to be spilt, the sacrificer would
									be likely to die. The speckled butter is the cattle; his cattle
									fall, if his speckled butter falls; in that he takes again the
									speckled butter, he takes again cattle for him. The speckled
									butter is the breath; his breath falls, if his speckled butter
									falls; in that he takes again the speckled butter, he takes
									again breath for him. He takes it after placing gold (in the
									ladle), gold is immortality, the speckled butter is the breath;
									verily he places immortality in his breath. It is of a hundred
									measures, man has a hundred years of life, a hundred powers;
									verily on life and power he rests. He makes a horse sniff it,
									the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily from his own
									place of origin he fashions offspring for him. His sacrifice is
									broken whose speckled butter is spilt. He takes it again with a
									Rc addressed to Visnu; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he unites
									the sacrifice by the sacrifice.

							The sacrifice of him whose offering is too large is unsuccessful;
							'Surya, the god, for those that sit in the sky', he says; verily with
							the aid of Brhaspati and Prajapati he makes good the deficiency in the
							sacrifice. Now the Raksases infest the victim if it being offered to
							one deity is greater (than normal); 'Thou who hast a tawny embryo', he
							says; verily he sends it to the gods, to smite away the Raksases.
							'Bring near, O bringer', he says, the inspiration behind; verily he
							cuts off from the whole extent of the victim. He offers to Visnu
							Çipivista; Visnu Çipivista is the redundancy of the sacrifice, the
							greatness of the victim, the prosperity thereof; verily in the
							redundant he deposits the redundant, to appease the redundant. The
							sacrificial fee is gold of eight measures, for the (victim) has eight
							feet; the self is the ninth; (verily it serves) to win the victim. It
							is enveloped in a turban in an inner box, for so as it were is the
							victim, the omentum, the skin, the flesh, the bone; verily he obtains
							and wins the whole extent of the victim. He, for whom in the sacrifice
							this expiration is offered, by his sacrificing becomes richer.

								These two were together, Vayu blew them apart; they conceived a

								it to another god, still one should first offer on eight potsherds
								to Agni; verily redeeming it from Agni he offers it. Because; if a
								cloud should appear when it has been offered, he should either cast
								it into the waters or eat it whole; if he were to cast it into the

							The Vasat call cleft the head of the Gayatri; its sap fell away, it

							oblations are full of sap. Soma was in the third sky from hence; the
							Gayatri fetched it, a leaf of it was cut off, that became the Parna,
							that is why the Parna is so called. He whose ladle is made of Parna
							wood puts over the people. The Parna is the royalty, the Açvattha is
							the people; in that the ladle is made of Parna wood and the spoon of
							Açvattha, verily he puts the royalty over the people. Prajapati

							Vikankata; there he created offspring; the oblation of him whose

							He offers the Savitr offerings, for instigation. He offers with (an
							oblation) ladled up four times, cattle have four feet; verily he wins
							cattle; the quarters are four; verily he finds support in the quarters.
							The metres departed from the gods (saying), 'We will not carry your
							oblation without sharing (in it)'; for them they kept this (oblation)
							ladled up four times, for the Puronuvakya the Yajya, the deity, the
							Vasat call; in that he offers what has been ladled up four times, he
							delights the metres, and they delighted carry to the gods his oblation.
							If he desire of a man, for prosperity. With four (verses) he takes up
							the spade; the metres are four; verily (he takes it up) with the
							metres. 'On the instigation of god Savitr', he says, for instigation.
							Agni went away from the gods, he entered the reed; he resorted to the
							hole which is formed by the perforation of the reed; the spade is
							perforated to make it his birthplace; wherever he lived, that became
							black; (the spade) is stained, for perfection of form; it is pointed at
							both ends, for the winning of light both hence and from yonder world;
							it is a fathom long; so much is the strength in man; (verily it is)
							commensurate with his strength; it is unlimited in girth, to win what

							That part of the sacrifice is unsuccessful which is performed with no

							up the horse's halter, to make a Yajus and to make successful the
							sacrifice. 'Swiftly run hither, O steed', (with these words) he halters
							the horse; verily he proclaims its greatness in this form. 'Yoke ye the
							ass', (with these words) (he halters) the ass; verily he establishes
							the ass on the non-existent; therefore the ass is less real than the
							horse. 'In each need more strong', he says, he says, to light up (the
							heaven). 'The steed coming, from the way', 'Coming to earth, O steed',
							he says; verily he wishes for it with the first and obtains it with the
							second; with two (verses) he makes it come, for support; (with two) of
							the same form, therefore cattle are born of the same form. 'Thy back is
							the sky, thy abode earth', he says; Prajapati quickened him from these
							worlds; verily he proclaims its greatness in this form. The steed is
							possessed of the thunderbolt, by its incisors it is more puissant than
							those with one row of incisors, by its hair than those with two rows;

							which is without fire, the Adhvaryu would be; with a Gayatri verse he
							draws a line around, the Gayatri is brilliance; verily with brilliance,

							'On the instigation of the god Savitr thee', (with these words) he

							Agni on birth afflicted creatures with pain, him the gods appeased by

							the lotus leaf. He gathers with four (verses), the metres are four;
							verily (he gathers) with the metres. (He gathers) with Gayatri verses
							for a Brahman, for the Brahman is connected with the Gayatri; with
							Tristubh verses for a Rajanya, for the Rajanya is connected with the
							Tristubh; if he desire of a man, 'May he be richer', he should gather
							for him with both sets; verily upon him he bestows brilliance and power
							together. With eight (verses) he gathers; the Gayatri has eight
							syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri; verily he gathers all
							the extent of Agni. 'Sit thou, O Hotr', he says; verily he makes the
							deities sit down for him; 'The Hotr down', (with these words he makes)
							men (sit down); 'Sit thou down', (with these words he makes) birds (sit
							down); 'Be born noble in the forefront of the days', he says; verily he

							In that he digs he acts as it were harshly to this (earth); he pours

							'To him, O goddess, be Vasat with thee' in him', he says; Agni's
							portion is the plants; verily he unites him with them. 'Rich in flowers

							Agni when tied up is connected with Varuna; 'With extending blaze',

							lets loose on all sides the wrath of Varuna that is in him. He pours
							water down; the waters are appeased; verily by the waters appeased he
							calms his pain; with three (verses) he pours (it) down, Agni is three
							fold; verily he calms Agni's pain throughout his whole extent. 'Mitra
							having united the earth', he says; Mitra is the auspicious one of the
							gods; verily; and also (it serves) for support. He hands (the pan) over
							with one set (of verses), and addresses it with another, to make a
							pairing. He makes it with a triple stand; these worlds are three;
							(verily it serves) to obtain these worlds. He makes (it) with the

							makes a hole with a Yajus, for discrimination. He makes it so great, of
							equal girth with Prajapati, the beginning of the sacrifice. He makes it
							with two breasts, for the milking of sky and earth; he makes it of four
							breasts, for the milking of cattle; he makes it of eight breasts, for
							the milking of the metres. For him who practises witchcraft he should
							make it nine cornered; verily gathering together the threefold
							thunderbolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. 'Having made the
							great pan', (with these words) he deposits (it); verily he establishes
							it among the deities.

							He fumigates with horse-dung; the horse is connected with Prajapati;
							(verily it serves) to connect it with its place of birth. 'May Aditi
							thee', he says; Aditi is this (earth); verily with Aditi in Aditi he
							digs, to avoid injury to it, for one hurts not oneself. 'May the wives
							of the gods thee', he says; the wives of the gods made it first, he
							says; therefore Agni shines along all the quarters. 'Arise, become
							great, stand upright, be thou firm', he says, for support. A bowl that
							is not poured upon is connected with the Asuras; he pours upon it;
							verily he makes it to be with the gods; with goats' milk he pours upon
							it; the milk of the goat is the highest form of draught; verily he
							pours upon it with the highest draught; (he pours) with a Yajus, for
							discrimination. He pours with the metres; with the metres it is made;

							With twenty-one beans he approaches the head of the man; beans are
							impure, the man's head is impure; verily by the impure he redeems its
							impurity and making it pure takes it. There are twenty-one; man is
							composed of twenty-one parts; (verily they serve) to obtain man. The
							man's head is impure as bereft of the breaths; he deposits (it near) an
							ant-heap pierced in seven places; the breaths in the head are seven;
							verily he unites it with the breaths, to make it pure. Of all those,
							with the seasons the year. 'Illuminate all the quarters of the earth',
							he says; therefore Agni illuminates all the quarters. 'The Açvins
							removed death from him', he says; verily from him he repels death. 'We
							from the darkness', he says; the darkness is the evil one; verily from
							him he smites away the evil one. 'We have come to the highest light',
							he says; the highest light is yonder sun; verily he attains unity with
							the sun. The year lags not, his future fails not, for whom these are
							performed. The last he recites with the word 'light' in it; verily he

							are seven; verily he consecrates him with the metres. 'Let every man of
							the god that leads', with the final Anustubh he offers; the Anustubh is
							speech; therefore speech is the highest of the breaths. The first
							quarter foot is deficient by one syllable; therefore men live upon the
							incomplete part of speech. He offers with a full (one), for Prajapati
							is full as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He puts on
							(a stick) of Vikankata wood; verily he wins radiance; he puts on one of
							Çami, for atonement. 'Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother', with
							three (verses) he adores (the fire) when born; three are these worlds;

							Formerly Agni would not burn what was not cut by the axe, but Prayoga,

							thee', (with these words) he puts on a kindling-stick; verily he makes
							what is not cut by the axe acceptable to him; all is acceptable to him
							who knows thus. He puts on one of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is
							strength; verily he confers strength upon him. Prajapati created Agni;
							him on creation the Raksases he supports him with the breaths. Sitting
							he puts (it) on; therefore offspring are born sitting; the black
							antelope skin is above; gold is brilliance, the black antelope skin is
							holy power; verily on both sides he encircles him, with brilliance and
							with holy power. The sling is of six fathoms in extent; the seasons are
							six; verily he raises him with the seasons; if it is of twelve fathoms,
							(he raises him) with the year. It is of Muñja grass; the Muñja is
							strength; verily he unites him with strength. 'Thou art the bird of
							fair feathers', (with these words) he gazes; verily he declares his
							greatness in that form. 'Go to the sky, fly to the heaven', he says;

							Headed by Visnu the gods won finally these worlds by the metres; in
							that he strides the strides of Visnu, the sacrificer becoming Visnu
							wins finally these worlds. 'Thou art the step of Visnu, overcoming
							hostility', he says; the earth is connected with the Gayatri, the
							atmosphere with the Tristubh, the sky with the Jagati, the quarters
							with the Anustubh; verily he wins in order these worlds with the
							metres. Prajapati created Agni; he being created went away from him, he
							wins with it this world; in that he strides the steps of Visnu, he wins
							by them yonder world. On the first day he strides forth, on the next
							day he pays reverence; therefore the minds of some creatures are set on
							energy, those of others on rest; therefore the active lords it over him
							who takes his ease therefore the active fixes upon a man who takes his
							ease. He clenches his fist, he restrains his speech, for support.

							'O lord of food, accord us food', he says; the lord of food is Agni;
							verily he grants him food. 'Uninjurious, impetuous', he says; he means
							in fact 'free from disease'. 'Do thou further the donor, bestow
							strength on our bipeds, our quadrupeds', he says; verily he invokes
							this blessing. 'May the All-gods bear thee up', he says; the All-gods
							are the breaths, the Rudras, the Vasus kindle thee again', he says;
							these deities first kindled him; verily by them he kindles him.
							'Hearken', 'Be thou', (with these words) he pays reverence; verily he
							awakens him; therefore after sleeping creatures awake. In his place he
							pays reverence, and therefore cattle returning go to their place.

							Yama holds the overlordship of the whole extent of earth; he who
							without asking from Yama a place of it for divine sacrifice piles up
							the fire is piling it for Yama. 'Go hence', (with these words) he makes

							divine sacrifice, he piles the fire for himself. Seeking they could not
							find so much as an arrow point of it which was not covered with death;
							the gods saw this Yajus, 'Go hence'; in that he makes him fix with this
							in these worlds. He who piles for a third time should pile in one
							layer; the world of heaven is in one place; verily he goes to the world
							of heaven by the single (layer). He makes (them) firm with mortar;
							therefore the bone is covered with meat; he who knows thus does not
							become diseased of skin. There are five layers, he makes firm with five
							(sets of) dust; they make up ten, the Viraj has ten syllables, the
							Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, in proper food.

							The Agni that was before and the one in the fire-pan are at variance;

							with the holy power; in that after uniting (them) he separates (them),
							therefore the holy power separates from the kingly power. With the

							'Abode and collector of riches', he says; rich are offspring and

							With man's measure he metes out; man is commensurate with the
							sacrifice; verily he metes him with a member of the sacrifice; so great
							is he as a man with arms extended; so much strength is there in man;
							verily with strength he metes him. Winged is he, for wingless he could
							not fly; these wings are longer by an ell; therefore birds have
							strength by their wings. The wings and the tail are a fathom in
							breadth; so much is the strength in man should eat of what has not been
							obtained, he would be separated from what has been obtained. Those
							trees which bear fruit he should sprinkle in the kindling-wood, to
							obtain what has not been obtained. From the quarters he gathers clods;
							verily winning the strength of the quarters, he piles the fire in the
							strength of the quarters; he should take a clod from the quarter where
							is he whom he hates, (saying), 'Food and strength do I take hence',
							verily he wins from that quarter food and strength, and hungry is he
							who is in that quarter. He scatters over the high altar, for on the
							high altar is the fire piled; the high altar is cattle; verily he wins
							cattle; (verily it serves) for the avoidance of passing over a limb of
							the sacrifice.

							'O Agni, strength and fame are thine', (with these words) he scatters

							seasons, Agni Vaiçvanara is the year; verily straightway he wins
							Vaiçvanara. This metre is called the ocean; offspring are born like the
							ocean; in that he scatters sand with this (hymn), (it is) for the
							propagation of offspring. Indra; it departed from the fire in the form
							of a black antelope, it entered the horse, it became the intermediate
							hoof of the horse; in that he makes the horse advance, he wins the
							sacrifice which has entered the horse. 'By Prajapati must the fire be
							piled', they say; the horse is connected with Prajapati; in that he
							makes the horse advance, by Prajapati he piles the fire. He puts down a
							lotus leaf; the lotus leaf is the birthplace of the fire; verily he
							piles the fire with its own birthplace. 'Thou art the back of the

							'The holy power born', (with these words) he puts down the gold disk.
							Prajapati created creatures with the Brahman class as first; verily the

							becomes who knows thus. The theologians say, 'Nor on earth, nor in the
							atmosphere, nor on sky should the fire be piled'; if he were to pile
							(it) on earth, he would afflict the earth with pain; nor trees, nor
							plants would in yonder world. 'In the Viraj should the fire be piled',
							they say; the Viraj is the ladle; in that he puts down two ladles, he
							piles Agni in the Viraj. As each beginning of the sacrifice is being
							performed, the Raksases seek to destroy the sacrifice; the golden disk
							is a beginning of the sacrifice; in that he pours butter over the gold
							disk, he smites away the Raksases from the beginning of the sacrifice.
							With five (verses) he pours butter; the sacrifice is fivefold; verily
							he smites away the Raksases from the whole extent of the sacrifice; he
							pours butter transversely; therefore animals move their limbs
							transversely, for support.

							He puts down the naturally perforated brick; the naturally perforated
							brick is this (earth); verily he puts down the (earth). He makes the
							horse sniff it; verily he bestows breath upon it; now the horse is
							connected with Prajapati; verily he piles the fire with Prajapati. The
							first brick that is put down obstructs the breath of cattle and of the
							sacrificer; it is a naturally perforated one, to permit the breath to
							pass, and also to reveal the world of heaven. 'In the fire must the
							fire be piled', they say; the Brahman to the east facing west the
							animals attend the sacrifice. If he piles the fire without a navel,
							(the fire) enters the navel of the sacrificer, and is liable to injure
							him. He puts down the mortar; this is the navel of the fire; verily he
							piles the fire with its navel, to avoid injury. (The mortar) is of
							Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength; in
							the middle he puts it down; verily in the middle he bestows strength
							upon him; therefore in the middle men enjoy strength. So large is it,
							commensurate with Prajapati, the mouth of the sacrifice. He pounds;
							verily he makes food; he puts (it) down with (a verse) addressed to
							Visnu; the sacrifice is Visnu, the trees are connected with Visnu;
							verily in the sacrifice he establishes the sacrifice.

							The pan is the concentrated light of these lights; in that he puts down

							middle we reverence the light; with sand he fills (it); that is the
							form of Agni Vaiçvanara; verily by his form he wins Vaiçvanara. If he
							desire of a man, 'May he become hungry', he should put down for one (a
							pan) deficient in size. If he were to put it down looking with the
							heads of the animals, (the snakes) would bite the animals of the
							village; if turned away, those of the wild; he should speak a Yajus, he
							wins the brilliance that is in the snake, he injures not the animals of
							the village, nor those of the wild. Or rather should it be put down; in
							that he puts down, thereby he wins the brilliance that is in the
							serpent; in that he utters a Yajus, thereby is it appeased.

							The fire is an animal, now the birthplace of the animal is changed in

							water bricks are seed; be puts down the water bricks; verily he places
							seed in the womb. Five he puts down (on the east) cattle are fivefold;
							verily he produces cattle for him; five on the south, the water bricks
							are the thunderbolt; verily with the thunderbolt he smites away the
							Raksases from the south of the sacrifice; five he puts down on the west
							is not worthy of heaven; the fire is worthy of heaven; in that he puts
							down the unifying (bricks), he unifies it; verily he makes it worthy of
							heaven. 'The eighteen-month-old calf the strength, the Krta of throws
							at dice', he says; verily by the strengths he wins the throws, and by
							the throws the strengths. On all sides (these verses) have the word
							wind', and therefore the (wind) blows on all sides.

							prospered, the Asuras were defeated. In that he puts down the
							Aksnayastomiyas in one place after reciting in another, (it is) to
							overcome foes: he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. 'The swift,
							the triple', (with these words) he puts down on the east; the triple is
							the beginning of the sacrifice; therefore the left hand is most to be
							maintained. 'Inspiration, the thirty-onefold', (with these words) he
							puts down on the east; inspiration is speech, speech is the beginning
							of the sacrifice; verily he establishes the beginning of the sacrifice
							on the east. 'The surface of the tawny one, the thirty fourfold', (with
							these words he puts down) on the south; the surface of the tawny one is
							yonder sun; verily he places splendour on the south; therefore the
							right side is the more resplendent. 'Support, the thirty threefold',
							(with these words he puts down) on the west, for support. 'The vault,
							the thirty-sixfold', (with these words he puts down) on the north'; the
							vault is the world of heaven; (verily it serves) to attain the world of

							'Thou art the portion of Agni', (with these words he puts down) on the

							beginning of the sacrifice, holy power is the beginning of the
							sacrifice, the threefold is the beginning of the sacrifice; verily on

							verily on birth he gives him food; therefore on birth he eats food.
							'The birthplace saved, the seventeenfold Stoma', he says; the

							are put down the dawn breaks; verily he smites away the dark.

							By the 'sitters on the vault' the gods went to the world of heaven;

							(ná-ákam); the 'sitters on the vault' are the home of the sacrificer;
							in that he puts down the 'sitters on the vault', the sacrificer thus

							brilliance of the Prstha (Stotras); in that he puts down the 'sitters
							on the vault' and of the sacrificer; there fore no other brick should
							be put down higher. He puts down the naturally perforated brick; the
							naturally perforated brick is yonder (sky); verily he puts down yonder
							(sky). He makes the horse sniff it; verily be places breath in it;
							again the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he

							The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse;
							because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva)
							has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who
							sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he
							becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for
							everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods
							overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil he overcomes, he
							overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and
							he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled;
							therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right
							from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace
							in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it
							in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the
							thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in

							The waters were the wives of Varuna; Agni longed for them, he had union

							he puts down two Viraj (bricks) he puts down these two (worlds). Now
							the seed which yonder (sky) impregnates, finds support in this (earth),
							it is propagated, it becomes plants; that is the head of the fire;
							verily he piles the fire with its head. He becomes possessed of a head
							in yonder world who know thus. The fire is piled for the world of
							heaven; whatever is done out of order, that is not heavenly; the fire
							is heavenly; having put down the layer he should stroke it, (saying),
							'May the wise discern wisdom and folly, like backs straight and
							crooked, like men; for wealth and good offspring, O god, grant us
							freedom, and keep bondage from us.' Verily he puts it down in order. He
							piles (the fire) facing east; it becomes heavenly for him.

							He draws cups of water; the cups are the royal consecration; the fire
							is the consecration; the royal consecration is the consecration of
							Varuna; (the fire) to be piled is Agni's consecration; verily by them
							is he consecrated; verily also he conquers both the worlds, that of him
							who has offered the royal consecration and that of the piler of the
							fire. There are waters; the waters are foes of Agni; in that he puts
							the waters down below the fire, (they serve) to overcome his foe; he
							prospers himself, his foe is defeated. The waters are ambrosia he wins
							food for him; in the middle he puts (them) down; verily he bestows food
							on him in the middle; therefore in the middle is food eaten. It is
							offered to Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods: verily
							by holy power he wins food for him. 'Thou art splendour; for splendour
							thee!' he says; brilliant and resplendent does he become, for whom
							these are put down, and he who knows it thus.

							He puts down the bricks of being; in every place is death born;

							his witchcraft turns upon him (who does so) and lays him low. He who
							piles the fire is consecrated; these are the offerings of the divine
							consecrators; so many are the consecrations of the gods, and they is
							the form of the royal consecration. He who knowing thus piles the fire
							conquers both the worlds, that of him who has offered the royal
							consecration and that of the piler of the fire. When Indra had been
							consecrated, his power and strength fell away in ten places; the gods
							brought it together with the Sautramani; he who piles the fire is
							consecrated; having piled the fire he should sacrifice with the
							Sautramani; verily collecting power and strength he places them in

								that is the northern quarter; (the brick) which he put down above
								became the back, that is the zenith. Agni of the five bricks is
								this (earth); therefore when they dig in it they knock up against
								the brick, against gravel. Now all this (earth) in the eyes of the
								birds shines at night, therefore birds do not at night rest upon
								it. He who knowing this piles a fire finds support, and conquers
								all the quarters. The Brahman is connected with Agni, therefore the
								Brahman finds prosperity in all the quarters; verily every quarter
								he goes to is his own. The fire is the nest of the waters;
								therefore waters draw the fire; verily they enter their own

							three potsherds; in the third year he should sacrifice with the Abhijit

							Gayatri has eight syllables, and the morning pressing is connected with
							Agni and the Gayatri, verily he supports by it the morning pressing and
							the Gayatri metre. In that there is (an offering) on eleven potsherds,
							the Tristubh has eleven syllables, and the midday pressing is connected
							with Indra and the Tristubh, verily he supports by it the midday
							pressing and the Tristubh saves this world by it; in that he piles the
							fire in the second year, he saves the atmosphere by it; in that he
							sacrifices in the third year, he saves yonder world by it. This (fire)
							Para Atnara, Kaksivant Auçija, Vitahavya Çrayasa, and Trasadasyu
							Paurukutsya piled, being desirous of offspring; then indeed did they
							win thousands each of children; he is extended with offspring, with

							he be consecrated; the year has twelve months; the Viraj is the year;
							he obtains the Viraj. He should be consecrated for thirteen nights; the
							year has thirteen months; the Viraj has thirty syllables; he obtains
							the Viraj. For a month should he be consecrated; the year is the month;
							the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For four months should he
							be consecrated; for four months the Vasus bore him, they conquered the
							earth, the Gayatri metre; for eight the Rudras, they conquered the
							atmosphere, the Tristubh metre; for twelve the Adityas, they conquered
							the sky, the Jagati metre; then they attained distinction, supremacy
							over the gods. Therefore after keeping the fire for twelve months,
							should one pile it up; the year has twelve months, the fire to be piled
							is the year, the bricks are days and nights; he piles him with the

								he would be deprived of seed. Or rather they say, 'If he were not

							He makes a hall with beams pointing east. The gods and men divided the
							quarters, the gods (obtained) the eastern, the Pitrs the southern, men
							the western, the Rudras the northern. In that he makes a hall with
							beams pointing east, the sacrificer approaches the world of the gods.
							He covers it over, for the world of the gods is hidden from the world
							of men. 'It is not easy', they say, 'to go from this world; for who
							knows if he is in yonder world or not.' He makes at the corners
							apertures. He says, 'Let the lord of thought purify thee'; the mind is
							the lord of thought; verily by the mind he purifies him. He says, 'Let
							the lord of speech purify thee'; verily by speech he purifies him. He
							says, 'Let the god Savitr purify thee'; verily being instigated by
							Savitr, he purifies him. He says, 'O lord of the purifier, with thy
							purifier, for whatsoever I purify myself, that may I have strength to
							accomplish.' Verily does he invoke this blessing.

							All the gods who purified themselves for the sacrifice waxed great. He
							who knowing thus purifies himself for the sacrifice waxes great. Having
							purified him without he makes him go within. Verily having purified him
							in the world of men, he leads him forward purified to the world of the
							gods. 'He is not consecrated by one oblation ', they say; verily he
							offers four with the dipping-ladle for consecration; the fifth he
							offers with the offering-ladle; the Pankti has five syllables, the
							sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. 'To the purpose,
							to the impulse, to Agni, it is a Gayatri. Because it has eleven
							syllables it is a Tristubh. Because it has twelve syllables, it is a
							Jagati. This Rc indeed is all the metres. In that he consecrates him
							with this Rc, he consecrates him with all the metres. The first quarter
							verse is of seven syllables; the Çakvari is of seven syllables, the
							Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. The first quarter-verse is
							defective by one syllable. Therefore men live on what of speech is
							defective. He offers with a full (verse) to win Prajapati; full as it
							were is Prajapati. He offers with a defective (verse), for the creation
							of offspring, for from what is defective Prajapati created offspring.

							The Rc and the Saman, unwilling to remain with the gods for the
							sacrifice, taking the form of a black antelope departed and remained
							away. The (gods) reflected, 'He whom they shall resort to will become
							all this world.' They called to them, and they depositing their might
							in day and night came up to them. This is the colour of the Rc, the
							white of the skin of the black antelope; the black is the colour of the
							Saman. 'Ye are images of the Rc and Saman', he says; verily he wins the
							Rc and the Saman his offspring would be liable to the itch; if he were
							to smile, they would become naked. He scratches himself with the horn
							of the black antelope and smiles, holding it for the protection of his
							offspring. He should not let go the horn of the black antelope before
							the bringing of the gifts (to the priests). If he were to let go the
							horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts, the womb
							of his offspring will be liable to miscarriage. When the gifts have
							been brought, he casts away the horn of the black antelope in the pit.
							The pit is the womb of the sacrificer; the horn of the black antelope
							is the womb; verily he places womb in womb, that the sacrificer may
							have a womb.

							Speech went away from the gods, not being willing to serve for the

							voice that is heard in the drum, the lute, and the flute. In that he
							offers the staff of the initiated, he wins speech. The (staff) is of
							Udumbara wood; the, Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength. It
							is level with his mouth; verily from the mouth (downwards) he wins
							strength for him. Therefore from the mouth they enjoy strength and bear
							more hither', he says; verily he obtains innumerable cattle. 'Thou art
							gold; be for my enjoyment', he says; verily he takes each according to
							its deity. He says, 'To Vayu thee, to Varuna thee!' If he did not so
							specify them, he would put the gifts out of correspondence with the
							deities, and would be brought low to the deities. Because he thus
							specifies them, he puts the gifts in correspondence with the deities,
							and is not brought low to the deities. 'O divine waters, son of the
							waters', he says. 'That divine part of yours, which is pure and fit for
							the sacrifice, may I not step upon', that he says in effect. 'The
							unbroken web of earth may I follow', he says; verily making a bridge he

							The gods, having fixed up a place of sacrifice, could not distinguish

							distinguish them, by thee.' They fixed upon Aditi, (saying, 'By thee
							shall we distinguish them.' She said, 'Let me choose a guerdon. Let the
							opening oblation in the sacrifice be mine, and the concluding oblation
							be mine.' Therefore the opening oblation of the sacrifice belongs to
							Aditi, and the concluding oblation belongs to Aditi. He offers to five
							gods; there are five quarters, (and so it serves) for the distinction
							of the quarters. Verily the opening oblation should be performed with
							both fore- and after-offerings, and the concluding oblation should be
							performed both with fore- and after offerings. He does not omit the
							self, nor offspring; the sacrifice does not come to ruin, nor the
							sacrificer. He offers the concluding oblation in the scrapings of the
							opening oblation; this is the course of the sacrifice. Now if he were
							to make the Yajya verses of the opening libation the Yajya verses of
							the concluding libation, he would mount to the other world away from
							this, and would be liable to die. The Puronuvakya verses of the opening
							libation should be made the Yajya verses of the concluding libation;
							verily he finds support in this world.

							Kadru and Suparni had a dispute (for the stake of) each other's form.
							Kadru defeated Suparni. She said, 'In the third heaven from here is the

							Suparni yonder (heaven), the descendants of Suparni the metres. She
							said, 'For this do parents rear children; "in the third heaven from
							here is the Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release". He buys Soma
							with a (cow) one year old; verily he buys it with the whole of speech.
							Therefore men utter speech when one year old. He buys with a cow which
							has no horns, small ears, is not one-eyed or lame, and has not seven
							hooves; verily he buys it with all. If he were to buy it with a white
							cow, the sacrificer would become leprous. If he were to buy with a
							black one, it would be a funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be
							likely to die. If with one of both colours, it would be one sacred to
							Vrtrahan, and he would either overcome his foe or his foe him. He buys
							with a ruddy, yellow-eyed one. This is the form of Soma; verily he buys
							it with its own deity.

							That became gold. Therefore they purify gold forth from the waters. The

							gold, placing it in the ghee, therefore are offspring produced, through
							that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones. The ghee is Agni's
							loved abode, the gold, is radiance. 'This is thy body, O pure one. This
							is thy splendour', he says; verily he unites Agni with his radiance and
							his body one of the gods; verily he places him below her, for guiding
							hither. He does as it were a harsh thing when he recites that (text) of
							Rudra's. 'In the path of Mitra', he says, for soothing. He buys indeed
							by speech when he buys by the cow with which the Soma is bought. Hail!
							Return with Soma as thy comrade, with wealth', he says, verily having
							purchased by means of speech, he restores speech to himself. The speech
							of him who knows thus is not likely to fail.

							He follows six steps. Speech does not speak beyond the sixth day. He
							wins speech in the size in which she is found in the path of the year.
							He offers in the seventh footprint. The Çakvari has seven feet, the
							Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. There are seven domesticated
							animals, and seven wild; there are seven metres to win both sets of
							animals. 'Thou art a Vasvi, thou art a Rudra', he says; verily thus by
							her form he expounds her greatness does not deprive himself of cattle.
							Saying 'Thine be wealth', he hands it to the sacrificer, and so bestows
							wealth on the sacrificer. Saying 'Thine be wealth', (the sacrificer
							hands it) to his wife. For a wife is the half of oneself, and to do so
							is as it were to deposit it in one's house. 'Let me attend on thee with
							Tvastr's aid', he says. Tvastr is the maker of the forms of offspring,
							of pairings; verily he places form in cattle. For this world the
							Garhapatya fire is piled up; for yonder world the Ahavaniya. If he were
							to cast it on-the Garhapatya fire, he would be rich in cattle in this
							world; if on the Ahavaniya, he would be rich in cattle in yonder world
							he casts it on both; verily he makes him rich in cattle in both worlds.

							The theologians say, 'Should the Soma be clarified or not?' Soma indeed
							is the king of plants; whatever falls upon it is swallowed by it. If be
							were to clarify it, it would be as when one expels from the mouth what
							has been swallowed; if he were not to clarify it, it would be as when
							something falls upon the eye and moves to and fro; the Adhvaryu would
							be hungry, the sacrificer would be hungry. 'O Soma-seller, purify the
							Soma', he should say; so whether it be the one; verily he unites it
							with all the gods, the Soma is cattle; (with the words) 'For expiration
							thee', he ties it; verily he confers expiration upon cattle. (With the
							words) 'For cross-breathing thee', he looses it; verily he confers
							cross-breathing upon cattle; therefore the vital breaths do not desert
							a sleeper.

							If he were to barter (it) in response (to the words), 'Let me buy with
							one-sixteenth (of the cow) from thee, with one-eighth', he would make
							the Soma not worth a cow, the sacrificer not worth a cow, the Adhvaryu
							not, worth a cow, but he would not depreciate the mightiness of the
							cow. 'With a cow let me buy from thee', verily he should say; verily he
							makes the Soma worth a cow, the sacrificer worth a cow, the Adhvaryu
							worth a cow, yet still he does not depreciate the mightiness of the
							cow. He buys (it) with a she-goat; verily he buys it full of fervour;
							he buys (it) with gold; verily he buys it bright, Bhraja', he says;
							they indeed in yonder world guarded the Soma; from them they grasped
							the Soma; if he were not to indicate to them those that serve as the
							price of Soma, he would not have purchased the Soma, and they would not
							guard the Sonia for him in yonder world. In that he indicates to them
							those that serve as the price of Soma, he really purchases the Soma,
							and they guard the Soma for him in yonder world.

							The Soma when bought and tied up is connected with Varuna. Come as a

							purchased in the right thigh of Indra; now the sacrificer is Indra;
							therefore he says thus. 'With life, with fair life', he says; verily
							seizing the gods. 'Honour to the radiance of Mitra and Varuna', he
							says, for atonement. They bring forward this Soma, it rests with Agni,
							they in uniting overpower the sacrificer. Now the consecrated person
							has for long been holding himself ready for the sacrifice. In that he
							offers an animal to Agni and Soma, that is a buying-off of himself;
							therefore of it he should not eat; for as it were it is a buying-off of
							a man. Or rather they say, 'By Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra'. In that
							he offers an animal to Agni and Soma, it slays hostile things for him;
							therefore he should eat of it. He honours it with a verse addressed to
							Varuna; verily he honours it with its own deity.

							If he should offer hospitality after unyoking both (the oxen), he would
							break up the sacrifice. If (he should offer) before he has unyoked
							both, it would be as when hospitality is offered to one who has not yet
							arrived. One ox is unyoked, one ox is not unyoked; then he offers
							hospitality, for the continuance of the sacrifice. The wife (of the
							sacrificer) holds on (to the cart); for the wife is mistress of the
							household gear; verily he offers what is approved by the wife. The
							share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair; so the wife also,
							'There are both Agni and Soma here; why is hospitality offered to Soma
							and not to Agni?' In that having kindled fire he places it on the fire,
							by that verily is hospitality offered to Agni. Or rather they say,
							'Agni is all the gods.' In that he kindles fire after placing the
							oblation, he thus produces all the gods for the oblation when it has
							been placed.

							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods fell out among

							separated in five bodies, Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras,
							Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas, Brhaspati with the
							All-gods. They reflected, 'Our foes, the Asuras, we are profiting in
							that we are falling out among ourselves; let us remove (from us) and
							deposit together those bodies which are dear to us; from these shall he
							depart who, making Agni their protection, overcame the Asuras. Now he
							as it were enters Agni who undergoes the intermediate consecration,
							(and it serves) for the overcoming of his foes; he prospers himself,
							his foe is overcome. He protects himself by the consecration, his
							offspring by the intermediate consecration. The girdle he makes
							tighter; for his offspring are closer to him than himself. He drinks
							warm milk, and rubs himself with bubbling water; for fire is
							extinguished by cold, (and these serve) for kindling. 'Thy dread form,
							O Agni', he says; verily with its own deity he consumes the hot milk,
							for unity, for atonement.

							The Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was

							They made ready an arrow, Agni as the point, Soma as the socket, Visnu
							as the shaft. They said, 'Who shall shoot it?', the half-months number
							twenty four; verily he delights the half-months. He should perform an
							awl-shaped intermediate consecration who wishes, 'May there be
							prosperity for me in this world', (that is) one to begin with, then
							two, then three, then four; this indeed is the awl-shaped intermediate
							consecration; verily there is prosperity for him in this world. He
							should perform an intermediate consecration broader at the top than
							below who wishes, 'May there be prosperity for me in yonder world',
							(that is) four to begin with, then three, then two, then one; this
							indeed is the intermediate consecration broader at the top than below;

							They go to the world of heaven who perform the Upasads. Of them he who
							takes out (a little food) is left behind; one must take out carefully,
							(thinking) 'I have not taken out anything.' He who is left behind
							wearied among those who go on their own mission sticks behind and lives
							at (home). Therefore after once taking out, one should not take out a
							second time. One should take out of curd, that is the symbol of cattle;
							verily by the symbol he wins cattle. All this earth is the Vedi, but
							they measure off and sacrifice on so much as they deem they can use.
							The back cross-line is thirty feet, the eastern line is thirty-six
							feet, the front cross-line is twenty-four feet. These make up tens; the
							Viraj has ten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he wins
							food. He digs up (the earth); verily he digs away whatever in it is
							impure. He digs up; therefore the plants perish. He spreads the
							sacrificial strew; therefore the plants again revive. He spreads over
							the strew the upper strew. The strew is the people; the upper strew is
							the sacrificer; verily he makes the sacrificer higher than the man who
							does not sacrifice; therefore the sacrificer is higher than the man who
							does not sacrifice.

							twelve in the Ahina, to preserve the strength of the sacrifice; thus it

							fortunate. So he takes one teat for his milk drink, then two, then
							three, then four. That, his foe is overcome. Now the man who is
							consecrated is a foetus, the consecration-shed is the womb (in which he
							is). If the man who is consecrated were to leave the consecration-shed,
							it would be as when a foetus falls from the womb. He must not leave, to

							if the man who is consecrated were to leave (the shed), he would be
							likely to spring up and slay him. He must not leave, to protect
							himself. He lies on the right side; that is the abode of the sacrifice;

							they besprinkle the high altar before (they sprinkle) the fire, for
							that was its chosen boon. He measures (it) round with the yoke-pin; the
							swift of mind with the Pitrs on the right, the wise one with the Rudras
							behind, and Viçvakarman with the Adityas on the left. In that he
							sprinkles the high altar, verily thus does the sacrificer repel his
							foes from the quarters. Indra gave the Yatis to the Salavrkas; them
							they ate on the right of the high altar. Whatever is left of the
							sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the high altar;
							whatever cruel is there that he appeases thereby. He should think of

							(with the words), 'Thou art a lioness, bestowing fair offspring, hail!'
							They obtained offspring. They having obtained offspring,' Return to us;
							bear the offering for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon. Whatever of
							the offering when taken up falls outside the enclosing sticks, let that
							be the portion of my brothers.' Therefore whatever of the offering when
							taken up falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their portion;
							verily therewith be delights them. He reflected, 'My brothers of old
							perished because they had bones. I will shatter bones.' The bones he
							shattered became the Buteafrondosa, the flesh which died on them
							bdellium. In that he brings together these paraphernalia, verily thus
							be brings Agni together. 'Thou art the rubble of Agni', he says, for

							He loosens the knot; verily he sets them free from the noose of Varuna;
							verily he makes them fit for the sacrifice. Having sacrificed with a
							verse to Savitr, he brings forward the oblation-holders; verily on the
							instigation of Savitr he brings them forward. The axle which is tied on
							both sides is Varuna of evil speech; if it were to creak, it would
							creak against the house of the sacrificer. 'With fair voice, O god, do
							thou address the dwelling', he says; the dwelling is the house; (verily
							it serves) for atonement. The wife (of the sacrificer), with this Rc
							verse which contains a blessing he strikes in the prop of the southern
							oblation-holder; verily the sacrificer at the beginning of the
							sacrifice wins blessings. Now Danda Aupara split by the Vasat call the
							axle of the third oblation-holder; the third cover put on the
							oblation-holder (serves) to make up the third oblation-holder, The
							oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice. 'Thou art the forehead of
							Visnu: thou art the back of Visnu', he says. Therefore so often is the
							head divided. 'Thou art the string of Visnu; thou art the fixed point
							of Visnu', he says, for the oblation-holder is connected with Visnu as
							its deity. Now the knot which he first ties, if he were not to unloose
							it, the Adhvaryu would perish from suppression of urine; therefore it
							must be unloosed.

							thou art the, woman', he says, to appease it. Now, as each part is
							performed, the Raksases seek to injure the sacrifice; 'The Raksas is
							encompassed, the evil spirits are encompassed', he says, to smite away
							the Raksases in the middle they enjoy strength. In the world of the
							sacrificer are the southern coverings, in that of his foe are the
							northern; he makes the southern the higher; verily he makes the
							sacrificer higher than the man who does not sacrifice; therefore the

							the crevices, for distinction; therefore people depend on the forest.
							'May our songs, O lover of song', he says; that is according to the

							the spell, and which are of Visnu', he says, for the sounding-holes
							have Visnu for their deity. The Asuras in retreat dug in spells against
							the vital airs of the gods; they found them at the distance of an arm;
							therefore they are dug an arm's length deep. 'Here do I cast out the
							spell, the sounding-holes are the vital airs, the pressing-boards the

							the mouth, the high altar the nose, the Sadas the stomach. When he eats

							(the juice) with the pressing-stones on the oblation-holder over the
							skin, sacrifice in the Ahavaniya, retire towards the west, and consume
							(the Soma) in the Sadas. He who knows the milking of the Viraj in the

							its hide, the pressing-boards its udder, the sounding-holes its teats,
							the pressing-stones its calves, the priests the milkers, Soma the milk.
							He, who knows thus, milks her.

							From the pit he scatters (earth) on the altars; the pit is the
							birthplace of the sacrifice; (verily it serves) to unite the sacrifice
							with its birthplace. The gods lost by conquest the sacrifice; they won
							it again from the Agnidh's altar; the Agnidh's altar is the invincible
							part of the sacrifice. In that he draws off the altar fires from that
							of the Agnidh, he renews the sacrifice from the invincible part of it.
							Conquered as it were they go who creep to the Bahispavamana (Stotra)
							when the Bahispavamana has been sung, and his voice would fail. The
							theologians say, 'The Adhvaryu should not go beyond the Sadas to the
							west before the Soma offering is completed. Then how is he to go to
							offer the sacrifices in the southern fire? Because that is the end of
							the fires. But how are the gods to know whether it is the end or not?'
							He goes round the Agnidh's altar to the north and offers the sacrifices
							in the southern fire; verily he does not mingle the breaths. Some of
							the altars are besprinkled, some not; those which he besprinkles he
							delights; those which he does not besprinkle he delights by indicating
							them.

							The Vaisarjana offerings are made for the world of heaven. He offers in
							the Garhapatya with two verses; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it
							serves) for support. He offers in the Agnidh's fire; verily he
							approaches the atmosphere; he offers in the Ahavaniya; verily he makes
							him go to the world of heaven. The Raksases sought to harm the gods as
							they were going to the world of heaven; they smote away the Raksases
							through Soma, the king, and making themselves active went to the world
							of heaven, to prevent the Raksases seizing them. The Soma is ready at
							hand; so he offers. 'Here (may) I (be free) from Varuna's noose', he
							says; verily he is freed from Varuna's noose. 'O Agni, lord of vows,'
							(he says). 'One should recover one's former body', they say, 'for who
							knows if the richer, when his will is accomplished will restore it or
							not.' The pressing-stones are the troop of thieves of King Soma; him,
							who knowing thus, places the pressing-stones on the Agnidh's altar, the
							troop of thieves finds not.

							Having sacrificed with a verse addressed to Visnu, he approaches the
							post. The post has Visnu for its deity; verily he approaches it with
							its own deity. 'I have passed by others, I have not approached others',
							he says, for he passes by others, and does not approach others. I have
							found thee nearer than the farther, farther than the near', he says,
							for he finds it nearer than the farther, farther than the near. 'I
							welcome thee that art of Visnu, for the sacrifice to the gods'. (He
							should cut one) of six cubits for one who desires support; the seasons
							are six; verily he finds support in the seasons. (He should cut one) of
							seven cubits for one who desires cattle; the Çakvari has seven feet,
							the Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. (He should cut one) of
							nine cubits for one who desires brilliance, commensurate with the
							Trivrt Stoma; the Trivrt is brilliance; verily he becomes brilliant.
							(He should cut one) of eleven cubits for one who desires power; the
							Tristubh has eleven syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily he becomes
							powerful. (He should cut one) of fifteen cubits for one who has foes;
							the thunderbolt is fifteenfold; (verily it serves) for the overcoming
							of foes. (He should cut one) Of seventeen cubits for one who desires
							offspring; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves) to gain
							Prajapati. (He should cut one) of twenty-one cubits for one who desires
							support; the Ekavinça is the support of the Stomas; (verily it serves)
							for support. It has eight corners; the Gayatri has eight syllables, the
							Gayatri is brilliance, the Gayatri is the beginning of the sacrifice;
							verily it is commensurate with brilliance, the Gayatri, the beginning
							of the sacrifice.

							'To earth thee! To atmosphere thee! To sky thee!' he says; verily for
							these worlds he anoints it. He anoints from the foot upwards, for
							upwards as it were is the world of heaven. Cruel as it were is that
							which he does when he digs; he pours water over, for expiation he pours
							(water) mixed with barley; barley is strength. The post is of the
							height of the sacrificer. As great as is the sacrificer, so much
							strength does he put in it of the post is the part above the top; that
							is their share; verily by it he delights them. The gods when the Soma
							sacrifice was complete cast the offering-spoons (into the fire) and the
							post; they reflected, 'Here we are making a disturbance of the
							sacrifice', they saw a ransom in the bunch of grass for the
							offering-spoons, in the chip for the post. When the Soma sacrifice is
							complete he casts (in the fire) the bunch of grass, he offers the chip,
							to avoid disturbing the sacrifice.

							The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They
							offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni, for they found nothing else to
							offer; thence indeed these creatures were born; in that he casts the
							fire on the fire after producing it, (it serves for) the propagation of
							offspring. Now the fire is Rudra, the beast the sacrificer; if he were
							to produce the fire after offering the beast, he would place the
							sacrificer in the power of Rudra, 'For him who is being cast forward
							recite', he says; verily as each part is performed he completes him. He
							recites all Gayatri verses; Agni has the Gayatri as his metre; verily
							he unites him with his own metre. The fire is in front; having produced
							fire he casts it forward; the two uniting overpower the sacrificer; 'Be
							of one mind with us', he says, to appease (them). He offers after
							casting (the fire) forward; verily he gives him food on birth; he
							offers with melted butter; the melted butter is the dear home of Agni;
							verily he unites him with his dear home, and also with brilliance.

							'For food thee!' (with these words) he takes up the strew, for he who
							sacrifices strives (icháte) as it were. 'Thou art the impeller', he
							says, for he brings them up. 'To the gods the servants of the gods have
							come', he says, for being the servants of the gods they go to the gods.
							'The priests, the eager ones', he says; the priests are the priests,
							the eager ones, therefore he says thus. 'O Brhaspati, guard wealth'
							thee, for the plants thee I sprinkle', be says, for from the waters,
							from the plants, the beast is born. 'Thou art a drinker of the waters',
							he says, for he is a drinker of the waters who is offered in sacrifice.
							'O ye divine waters, make it palatable, a very palatable offering for
							the gods', he says; verily he makes it palatable. From above he
							sprinkles (it); verily he makes it pure from above; he makes it drink;
							verily within he makes it pure; from below he besprinkles (it); verily
							all over he makes it pure.

							By means of Agni as Hotr the gods defeated the Asuras. Recite for Agni
							as he is kindled', he says, for the overcoming of foes. He recites
							seventeen kindling-verses; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it
							serves) to win Prajapati. He recites seventeen; there are twelve months
							and seven seasons, that is the year; offspring are born in the course
							of the year; (verily it serves) for the propagation of offspring. The
							gods, after reciting the kindling-verses, could not discern the
							sacrifice; Prajapati silently performed. He chooses the priests, verily
							he chooses the metres, he chooses seven; there are seven tame animals,
							seven wild; there are seven metres, (and so it serves) to win both. He
							offers eleven fore-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the
							body is the eleventh; verily his fore-offerings are of the same size as
							the beast. One (of them) lies around the omentum; verily the body lies
							around the body. The axe is a thunderbolt, the splinter of the
							sacrificial post is a thunderbolt, the gods by making a thunderbolt of
							the ghee smote Soma. 'Anointed with ghee, do ye guard the beast', he
							says; verily, overpowering it by means of the thunderbolt, he offers
							it.

							He encircles (it) with fire; verily he makes it completely offered,
							that nothing may be lost, for that which falls of the oblation is
							(thus) not lost. He encircles (it) with fire thrice, for the sacrifice
							is thrice repeated; also (it serves) to smite away the Raksases. The
							theologians say, 'Should the beast be grasped hold of, or not?' Now the
							beast is led to death; if he were to grasp hold of it, the sacrificer
							would be likely to die. Or rather they say, 'The beast is led to the
							world of heaven'; verily he pays homage to them. 'Come forward,
							irresistible', he says; the resisting is the foe; (verily it serves) to
							beat away the foe. 'Along the stream of ghee, with offspring, with
							increase of wealth', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'O ye
							waters, goddesses, purifying', he says; that is according to the text.

							When the beast is offered in sacrifice, pain seizes its vital airs.
							'Let thy speech swell, let thy breath swell' he says; verily he removes
							the pain from the vital airs. From the vital airs the pain enters the
							earth; (with the words) 'Hail to the and night!' he pours it down;
							verily he removes the pain of the earth by day and night. 'O plant,
							protect him', 'O axe, harm him not', he says; the axe is a thunderbolt,
							for the completion of the sacrifice. The speckled butter is the
							expiration and inspiration of cattle, the omentum is the body; having
							poured butter on the speckled ghee,' he pours on the omentum; verily in
							the body of cattle he deposits expiration and inspiration. 'Hail! Go to
							Urdhvanabhas, the offspring of the Maruts', he says; Urdhvanabhas, the
							offspring of the Maruts, used to cast forward the omentum-forks of the
							gods; verily through him he casts them forward. He casts them forward
							in opposite directions; therefore expiration and inspiration are in
							opposite directions.

							Having offered in sacrifice the beast, he strews over (it) a cake,
							verily he sacrifices it with its sap. Having performed the rite with
							the omentum, he performs with the cake; the cake is strength; verily he
							places strength in the midst of cattle; verily also he closes the cut
							in the beast. Having made offering of the speckled ghee, he thrice
							asks, 'Is the oblation cooked, Çamitr?' for the gods found truth in
							three (cookings). He who says what is not cooked is cooked (is
							burdened) with sin. The speckled butter is the expiration and the
							inspiration of cattle. He said, 'Let me choose a boon; let me have a
							choice part of the beast.' He chose that choice part (of the beast),
							the shoulder from the fore part, the intestines from the middle, the
							hip from the hind part. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were
							defeated; in that he makes portions of three members it is for the
							overcoming of his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. He
							cuts off transversely; therefore cattle move forward their limbs
							transversely, for support.

							He covers the dipping-spoons with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat;
							verily he bestows on cattle their distinguishing mark. He covers (them)
							after putting (the fat) on the soup; the soup is the sap of cattle;
							verily he bestows sap upon cattle. He stirs the oblation of fat with
							the rib; the rib is the middle of cattle, the fat is the sap of cattle;
							in that he stirs the oblation of fat with the rib, he places sap in the
							middle of cattle. Now they kill, in the middle the beast, last the
							speckled butter; therefore the fore-sacrifices are performed with
							butter, the beast (is offered) in the middle, and the after-sacrifices
							with speckled butter. Therefore that is mixed as it were, for it was
							created last. He offers eleven after-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs
							of the beast, the body is the eleventh; he offers as many
							after-sacrifices as is the size of the beast. Now they kill the beast
							when they dispose of it; the speckled butter is the expiration and the
							inspiration of cattle; in that he per forms the after-sacrifices with
							speckled butter, verily he bestows expiration and inspiration upon
							cattle.

							By means of the sacrifice Prajapati created offspring; verily he
							created them by the subsidiary sacrifices; in that he offers the
							subsidiary sacrifices, verily thus the sacrificer creates offspring. He
							cuts off from the hind portion, for from the hind portion offspring are
							born; he cuts off from the thick side, for offspring are born from the
							thick side; he cuts off without confusion, to prevent confusion of the
							vital airs. He does not turn (it) round; if he were to turn (it) round,
							disease would be likely to seize his offspring. 'Go to the ocean,
							hail!' he says verily thus he produces seed. if he were to place the
							heart-spit on the earth, he would cause pain to the earth; if on the
							waters, he would cause pain to the waters; he places it in the
							meeting-place of dry and wet, to appease both. He should think of
							whomsoever he hates; verily he causes him pain.

							The gods divided the sacrifice on the Agnidh's altar: of what was left
							over they said, 'Let this remain here.' That is why the Vasativari
							(waters) have their name. But in the morning they could not arrange (to
							divide it); they placed it in the waters, they became the Vasativaris.
							He takes the Vasativaris; the Vasativaris are the sacrifice; verily
							having taken from the beginning the sacrifice he stays (with it). If
							the sun set, on one who has not taken (the waters), his sacrifice would
							not be begun world he would have cattle. He places (them) on both;
							verily he makes him have cattle in both worlds. He carries (them) round
							everywhere, to smite away the Raksases. 'Ye are the share of Indra and
							Agni', he says; that is according to the text. He places (them) on the
							Agnidh's altar; the Agnidh's altar is the invincible part of the
							sacrifice; verily he places (them) on the invincible part of the
							sacrifice. Wherever in the performance of a sacrifice nothing is done,
							in that (place) the Raksases infest the sacrifice. In that he takes of
							the Vahantis, that part of the sacrifices lies being performed, to
							prevent the infestation of the Raksases, for they do not move them, but
							they lie around until the third pressing, for the continuity of the
							sacrifice.

							The theologians say, 'He indeed would be an Adhvaryu who in making Soma

							he says; verily he makes it for men; 'To mind thee!' he says; verily he
							makes it for the Pitrs; 'To the sky thee! To the sun thee!' he says;
							verily he makes it for the gods; so many are the gods; verily he makes
							it descend for them all. Before the utterance of speech. 'Thou art the
							dragger', he says; verily he removes dirt from them. 'I draw you for
							the sustenance of the ocean', he says; therefore the waters though
							eaten and drunk do not waste away. The pit is the birthplace of the
							sacrifice, the Vasairivaris are the sacrifice; bringing the bowls of
							the Hotr and the Maitravaruna into contact he pours in the Vasativaris
							reciprocally, so that the sacrifice may have its birthplace; verily he
							produces it from its own birthplace. 'O Adhvaryu, didst thou seek the
							waters?' he says; 'they came to me; look upon them', in effect he says.
							If it is an Agnistoma, he makes a libation; if an Ukthya, he rubs
							(butter) on the enclosing-sticks; if it is an Atiratra, he goes forward
							uttering a text, to distinguish the sacrifices.

							'On the instigation of god Savitr (with these words) he takes up the
							pressing-stone, for instigation, 'with the arms of the Açvins', he
							says; for the Açvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods; 'with the hands of
							Pusan', he says, for support. The Soma is cattle, the Upançu
							pressing-(stone) is cross breathing; in that he measures round the
							Upançu pressing-(stone), he confers cross-breathing upon cattle. 'To
							Indra thee! To Indra thee!' (with these words) he measures, for the
							Soma is taken for Indra. Five times he measures with the text; this is
							Soma's Soma-drinking; he who knows thus reaches not destruction from
							Soma. When they press Soma they kill him; he keeps back shoots; verily
							he protects him. The shoots are the vital airs, Soma is cattle; he
							later lets go the shoots; verily he bestows vital airs upon cattle; two
							by two he lets them go; therefore the vital airs are in pairs.

							The Upançu Cup is breath; in that the cups are drawn beginning with the
							Upançu, they follow on breath. Aruna Aupaveçi used to say, 'At the
							morning pressing I establish the sacrifice and then I proceed with it
							when it has been established.' He first presses eight times; the
							Gayatri has eight syllables, the morning pressing is connected with the
							Gayatri; verily thereby he obtains the morning pressing. (He presses)
							eleven times on the second occasion; the Tristubh has eleven syllables,
							the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh, he should put (it)
							down (with the words), 'I set thee down on the breath of N.N.'; the
							breath is restless; verily he brings his breath to rest. He purifies by
							means of six shoots; the seasons are six; verily he purifies him by
							means of the seasons; thrice he purifies these worlds are three; verily
							he purifies him by means of these worlds. The theologians say, 'For
							what reason is it that three animals take by the hand?' In that thrice
							he draws separately the Upançu with his hand, therefore there are three
							animals which take by the hand, man, the elephant, and the ape.

							Whatever the gods did as the sacrifice, that the Asuras did. The gods
							saw that the sacrifice must be established in the Upançu (cup), and
							they established it in the Upançu. The Asuras grasping the thunderbolt
							attacked the gods; the gods in fear ran up to Indra, Indra obstructed
							them' by means of the Antaryama (cup), and that is why the Antaryama
							has its name, 'the obstructor'. In that the Antaryama cup is drawn,
							verily thus the sacrificer obstructs his foes. 'Through thee I
							interpose sky and earth, to separate expiration and inspiration. The
							Upançu and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration, the
							Upançu pressing-(stone) is cross-breathing. If he desire of a man, 'May
							he be likely to die', he should set them down for him without being in
							contact; verily he severs his expiration and inspiration from
							cross-breathing; swiftly he dies. If he desire of a man, 'May he live
							all his days', he should set them down for him in contact; verily he
							connects his expiration and inspiration with cross-breathing; he lives
							all his days.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 6: Chapter 4: Verse 7

							The cup for Indra and Vayu is speech; in that the cups are drawn
							beginning with that to Indra and Vayu, verily they follow speech. The
							gods said to Vayu, 'Let us slay Soma, the king'; he replied, 'Let me
							choose a boon; let your cups be drawn with mine first.' Therefore the
							cups are drawn with those for Indra and Vayu first. They slew him; he
							became putrid; the gods could not endure him, they said to Vayu, 'Make
							him sweet for us'. 'Thou art taken with a support', he says, and
							thereby have they Aditi for their deity, for those vessels that are
							made of wood are born from her womb, those that are made of clay are
							clearly hers; therefore he says thus. Speech aforetime spoke without
							discrimination; the gods said to Indra, 'Do thou discriminate this
							speech for us'; he replied, 'Let me choose a boon; let this (cup) be
							drawn for me and for Vayu together.' Therefore the cup is drawn
							together for Indra and Vayu. Indra approaching it in the midst
							discriminated it; therefore is speech spoken distinctly. Therefore is
							it drawn once, in the middle, for Indra, and twice for Vayu, for he
							chose two boons.

							The gods said to Mitra, 'Let us slay Soma, the king'; he replied, 'Not
							I; for I am the friend of all'; they answered, 'Still we will slay
							him'; he replied, 'Let me choose a boon; let them mix the Soma for me
							with milk.' Therefore they mix with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and
							Varuna. From him cattle departed (saying), 'He that was a friend hath
							done a cruel deed'; a cruel deed as it were and Mitra together let this
							(cup) be drawn.' Therefore it is drawn for Mitra and Varuna together;
							therefore with a king as helper they slay a king, with a Vaiçya a
							Vaiçya, with a Çudra a Çudra. This was not day or night, but
							undiscriminated; the gods said to Mitra and Varuna, 'Make this to shine
							forth for us'; they replied, 'Let us choose a boon; let one cup only be
							drawn before ours.' Therefore the cup for Indra and Vayu is drawn
							before that for Mitra and Varuna, for the Upançu and the Antaryama
							(cups) are expiration and inspiration. Mitra produced the day, Varuna
							the night; then indeed did this shine forth; in that (a cup) is drawn
							for Mitra and Varuna, (it is) for shining forth.

							The head of the sacrifice was cut; the gods said to the Açvins, Ye are
							physicians; do ye replace the head of the sacrifice', they replied. Let
							us choose a boon; let there be drawn a cup for us also herein.' For
							them they drew this cup for the Açvins; then indeed did they replace
							the head of the sacrifice; in that (the cup) for the Açvins is drawn,
							(it is) to restore the sacrifice. The gods said of these two, 'Impure
							are they, wandering among men, he sets down full vessels; therefore the
							breaths are full within; wherever in the performance of the sacrifice
							nothing is done, in that place the Raksases attack the sacrifice; in
							that he sets down full vessels the part of the sacrifice being
							performed is deposited to prevent the entry of the Raksases. He sets
							down in the north track of the southern oblation-cart; verily he places

							Brhaspati was the Purohita of the gods, Çanda and Marka of the Asuras;
							the gods had the holy power (Brahman), the Asuras had the holy power
							(Brahman); they could not overcome one another; the gods invited Çanda
							and Marka; they replied, 'Let us choose a boon; let cups be drawn for
							us also herein.' For them they drew these cups for Çukra and Manthin;
							then did the gods prosper, the Asuras were defeated. He for whom
							knowing thus these Çukra and Manthin (cups) are drawn, prospers
							himself, his foe. In that the Manthin vessel is of Vikankata and he
							mixes with groats, verily thus he gathers together the eye of
							Prajapati. The theologians say, 'For what reason does the Manthin
							vessel not go to the Sadas?' 'It is the vessel of misfortune', he
							should say; if it were to go there, the Adhvaryu would be blind, he
							would be ruined; therefore it does not go there.

							Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw the

							they reach the top; he for whom knowing thus the cups are drawn with
							the Agrayana at their head reaches the top of his equals. With a verse
							containing the word 'destructive' he should draw for him who has a
							rival; verily having destroyed his rival he reaches the top of his
							equals. 'Ye gods that are eleven in the sky', he says; therefore the
							cow sniffs the calf on birth. The Agrayana is the self of the
							sacrifice; at each pressing he draws it; verily he continues the
							sacrifice in itself. He brings (it) up from above verily thus he
							impregnates seed; he takes (it) from below verily he generates it. The
							theologians say, 'For what reason does the Gayatri, the least of the
							metres, support the pressings?' 'The Agrayana is the calf of the
							Gayatri; verily turning back towards it it supports all the pressings.
							Therefore a cow turns back towards the calf which is taken away.

							desire, 'May I bestow upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice',
							he should pour (it) down standing between the Sadas and the
							oblation-holder; verily he bestows upon the sacrificer the glory of the
							sacrifice. If he desire, 'May I bestow upon the Sadasyas the glory of
							the sacrifice', he should pour (it) down, grasping the Sadas; verily he
							bestows upon the Sadasyas the glory of the sacrifice.

							The Dhruva (cup) is the life of the sacrifice; it is drawn the last of

							his equals. 'Vaiçvanara, born for holy order', he says, for life has
							Vaiçvanara as its deity. It is drawn with Vaiçvanara on both sides;
							therefore there are breaths on both sides, below and above. The other
							cups that are drawn make a half, the Dhruva makes a half; therefore.
							'Before the Uktha it should be poured down', they say, for in front one
							enjoys life; 'In the middle it should be poured down', they say, for
							the middle one enjoys life; 'In the latter part it should be poured
							down', they say, for with the last one enjoys life. He pours (it) down

							The season-cups are drawn for the world of heaven; Indra and Agni are

							Indra in league with the Maruts slew Vrtra at the midday pressing; in
							that (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn at the midday pressing, they
							are drawn for the sacrificer as slaying the foe. Of him, when he had

							(the cups) for the Maruts; then indeed did he discern the seasons; in
							that (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn with the season-vessel, (they
							serve) to reveal the seasons. (The cups) for the Maruts are a weapon
							which the sacrificer hurls at his foe; with the first; verily with the
							first he won expiration, with the second inspiration, himself with the
							third, (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn to save the self of the
							sacrificer; verily he wins expiration with the first, inspiration by
							the second, and himself with the third. Indra slew Vrtra; the gods said
							of him, 'Great hath he become who hath slain Vrtra'; that is why
							Mahendra (great Indra) has his name. He drew this libation for
							Mahendra, having slain Vrtra and being above the other deities; in that
							(the cup) for Mahendra is drawn, so the sacrificer draws this libation,
							being above other people. He draws with the Çukra vessel; (the cup) for
							Mahendra has the sacrificer as its deity, the Çukra is brilliance; in
							that he draws (the cup) for Mahendra in the Çukra-vessel, verily he

							Aditi, desirous of offspring, cooked a Brahman's mess for the Sadhya

							her the four Adityas were born. A second (mess) she cooked; she
							reflected, 'They have been born for me from the remains; if I eat
							first, then stronger ones will be born from me'; she ate first, she
							became pregnant, from her was born an egg which miscarried. She cooked
							a third (mess) for the Adityas. (The stone) for pressing out the Upançu
							(cup) is this Aditya Vivasvant; it lies round this Soma drink until the
							third pressing. 'O bright Aditya, this is thy Soma drink', he says;
							verily he unites the Aditya Vivasvant with the Soma drink. 'With the
							rain of the sky I mix thee', (with these words) he should mix for one
							who desires rain; verily he wins rain. If it should fall quickly,
							Parjanya would be likely to rain; if long, (he would) not (be likely).
							He does not place (the cup) down, for from that which is not depressed
							offspring are produced. He should not utter the secondary Vasat; if he
							were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring; after
							sacrificing he should not look after (it); if he were to look after
							(it) his eye would be likely to be destroyed; therefore he should not

							which is not depressed offspring are produced. He does -not utter the

							the Gayatri; in that he draws (the cup) for Savitr from the Agrayana
							with the Antaryama vessel, verily he draws it off from its own
							birthplace. The All-gods. He draws Soma in Soma; verily thus he
							impregnates seed. 'Thou givest good protection, and art well
							established', he says, for he draws Soma in Soma, for support. In this
							same cup (offering) is made for men, gods, and Pitrs; 'Thou givest good

							(it) for men; 'The great', he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for
							the gods; 'Homage', he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for the
							Pitrs; so many are the gods; verily he draws it for them all. 'This is

							The Upançu is the breath; in that the first and the, last cups are
							drawn with the Upançu-vessel, verily they follow forward the breath,
							they follow back the breath. The Agrayana is Prajapati, the Upançu is
							the breath, the wives produce offspring; in that he draws (the cup) for
							(Tvastr) with the wives from the Agrayana with the Upançu-vessel, (it
							serves) for the production of offspring. Therefore offspring are born
							in accordance with the breath. The gods desired that the wives should
							go to the world of heaven men do not give up even one worthy of death
							who has come for help. Therefore in (the cup) for the wives for Tvastr
							also a drawing is made. He does not put (the cup) down, for from what
							is not depressed offspring are produced. He does not utter the
							secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his
							offspring; if he were not to do so, the Agnidh would consume the Soma
							before it had been appeased; he says the secondary Vasat muttering, he
							does not let Rudra go after his offspring, the Agnidh consumes the Soma
							after it has been appeased. 'O Agnidh, sit on the lap of the Nestr; O
							Nestr, lead up the wife', he says verily the Agnidh impregnates the
							Nestr, the Nestr the wife. He causes the Udgatr to look (at the wife);
							the Udgatr is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for the production of
							offspring. He causes water to follow along; verily thus he pours seed;
							along the thigh he causes it to flow, for along the thigh is seed
							poured; baring the thigh he causes it to flow, for when the thigh is
							bared, they pair, then seed is poured, then offspring are born.

							Indra slew Vrtra; he forced out his skull-bone, it became the wooden

							bays; he reflected regarding it, 'Shall I offer, or shall I not offer?'
							He reflected, 'If I shall offer, I shall offer what is raw; if I shall
							not offer, I shall make confusion in the sacrifice.' He decided to
							offer; Agni said, Thou shalt not offer what is raw in me'; he mixed it
							with fried grains cattle would attend and wait on him; if he were not
							to crush them, many cattle would attend, but not wait on him; in his
							mind he crushes them together, and effects both; many cattle attend and
							wait on him. They await the invitation from the Unnetr; verily they win
							the Soma-drinking that is here. He throws down (the remnants) on the
							high altar; the high altar is cattle, (the grains) for the yoker of
							bays are cattle verily they make cattle find support in cattle.

							Offspring and cattle are born through the cups, goats and sheep through
							the Upançu and Antaryama, men through the Çukra and Manthin,
							whole-hooved animals through the season-cups, kine through the Aditya
							cup. The Aditya cup is drawn with the largest number of Rcs; therefore
							kine axe the most numerous of cattle; in that he thrice draws apart
							with his hand the Upançu (cup), therefore the female goat gives birth
							to two or three, but sheep are more numerous. The Agrayana is the
							father, the tub is the son; if the Agrayana is exhausted, he should
							draw from the tub; that is as when a father (a man) is a slayer of a
							Brahman (through slaying) an embryo which has not been discriminated.
							They go to the final bath; they deposit the pots, but lift up (the
							vessels) for Vayu; therefore they deposit a daughter on birth, a son
							they lift up. In that be utters the Puroruc, it is as when one brings
							(something) to a superior; in that he draws the cup, it is as when
							having brought (something) to a superior one proclaims (it); in that he
							puts it down, it is as when having deposited something with a superior
							one goes away. Whatever of the sacrifice is accompanied by a Saman or
							Yajus, is loose; whatever by a Rc is firm; they are drawn with a
							support in front to the accompaniment of a Yajus, (they are drawn) with
							a support behind to the accompaniment of a Rc, for the support of the
							sacrifice.

							again and again. Some vessels are used (repeatedly), and others not.
							Through those that are used once only the plants fade; through those
							which are used again; he found no stay in himself; he saw these cakes
							,as an addition to the pressing, them he offered, and with them he made
							a stay in himself; therefore as additional to the pressing the cakes
							are offered; therefore as additional to the pressing he should partake
							of the cakes; verily he makes a stay in himself, and the Soma does not
							flow through him. The theologians say, 'Neither by Rc nor by Saman is
							the five made up; what then is the fivefold character of the

							for leading to the world of heaven. 'Go to the sky, fly to heaven',

							six; verily he delights the seasons; he offers three with Yajuses or on
							the lord of the sacrifice? He replied, 'On the lord of the sacrifice.'
							'But in truth Srñjayas have been defeated', he said, 'the sacrifice
							should have been made to rest on the sacrifice, to prevent the defeat

							slayer of Raksases, is the Saman; (verily it serves) for the smiting
							away of the Raksases. Thrice he performs the finale; these worlds are

							would be possessed of cattle, but Varuna would seize him; if he were
							not to partake, he would have no cattle, but Varuna would not seize
							him; he should touch them only, he becomes possessed of cattle, Varuna

							sacrifice comes to ruin the sacrificer comes to ruin along with it; in
							that he completes (the offering) (for Tvastr) with the wives with
							butter, (it serves) to support the sacrifice, and as the sacrifice
							finds support, the sacrificer finds support along with it. The offering
							of the caul has been performed, the offering of the cow is not yet

							verily he performs it at the right moment; then indeed comes the
							conclusion. It is for Tvastr; Tvastr of the seed that is spilt moulds

							for its deity; whatever of the Saman they do amiss, that is the
							atonement for it. They look at he propitiates the well-performed part
							of the sacrifice, by Varuna the ill-performed; the sacrificer is not
							ruined. Even as men plough the field with the plough, so do the Rc and
							the Saman plough the sacrifice; in that he offers a cow to Mitra and
							Varuna, verily he rolls a roller over the ploughed-up sacrifice, for
							atonement. The metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out, the cow
							is the sap of the metres; in that he offers the cow to Mitra and

							gods deceived the Asuras with the Adabhya (undeceivable), that is why
							the Adabhya has its name. He who knows thus deceives his foe; his foe
							deceives him not. The Adabhya is the form of Prajapati, called the
							freer; he draws from (the Soma) which is tied up, for freedom; he who
							knows thus is set free from his evil foe. They kill the Soma in that
							they press it; in the slaying of the Soma the sacrifice is slain, with
							the sacrifice the sacrificer. The theologians say, 'What is it that the
							sacrificer does in the sacrifice whereby he goes alive to the world of
							heaven?' The Adabhya is the taking alive; he draws from (the Soma)
							before pressing; verily he makes him go alive to the world of heaven.
							Now they break the sacrifice asunder when they make it find support in

							The gods drew the cups in a line; Prajapati saw this Ançu, drew it, and

							drawn, prospers. He draws from (the Soma) when it has been once
							pressed, for once he prospered thereby. He draws with the mind, for
							Prajapati is mind as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati.
							He draws with (a vessel) of Udumbara; the Udumbara is strength; verily
							he wins strength; it has four corners; verily he finds support in the
							quarters. He who knows the foundation of the Ançu becomes possessed of
							a foundation. The Saman is that called the Vamadevya; singing in his
							mind that foundation he draws; verily he becomes possessed of a
							foundation. If the Adhvaryu were not to make a success of drawing the
							Ançu, for both the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer would it go ill; if he
							were to make a success, for both would it go well; he draws without
							breathing; this is its success. He breathes over gold; gold is
							immortality, breath is life; verily with life he quickens immortality;
							it is of a hundred (Krsnalas) in weight, man has a hundred (years of)
							life, a hundred powers; verily in life, in power he finds support.

							sixteenth Çastra, therefore is it the Sodaçin, and that is why the
							Sodaçin has its name. In that the Sodaçin is drawn, so the sacrificer
							bestows power and strength upon himself. To the gods the world of
							heaven; verily he wins four-footed cattle; two last; verily he wins
							two-footed (cattle); they make up an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech,
							therefore speech is the highest of the breaths. When the sun is
							half-set, he sets about the Stotra of the Sodaçin; in this world Indra
							slew Vrtra; verily straightway be hurls the bolt against his foe. The
							sacrificial fee is a reddish-brown horse; that is the form of the bolt;

							Production of offspring is light. Agni is the light of the gods; the

							is produced according to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two

							not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for
							they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths; the
							Pañcadaça the half-months; the Saptadaça Prajapati; these worlds are

								Soma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him. Yama
								approached them and said to them, 'May I have a share too in it.'
								They said to him, 'Be it so.' Yama saw in one of the (cows)
								strength. He said to them, 'This one has the strength of the
								thousand, this be mine, the rest yours.' They said, 'We all see
								that in this one is strength should be beautiful, perfect in form;
								for she is a boon; (verily it serves for) prosperity. Leading her
								round to the north of the Agnidh's place he makes her smell the
								wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying, 'Smell the tub, O great

							By the thousandth the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven. She makes

							thou make me go to the world of light', he says; verily she makes him
							go to the world of light. 'Do thou make me go to all holy worlds', he
							says; verily she makes him go to all holy worlds he says; verily she
							becoming gentle, well resting, auspicious, comes to him, and harms him
							not. The theologians say, 'Does the thousandth follow the thousand? or
							the thou sand the thousandth?' If he were to let her go to the east,
							the thousandth would follow the thousand; now the thousand has no
							understanding, and would not recognize the world of heaven. He lets her
							go to the west; the thousand follow after her. She knowing goes to the
							world of heaven. He lets her go towards the sacrificer. Quickly a
							thousand springs up. The (thousandth) is the last to be taken, but the
							first to go to the gods.

							Atri gave offspring to Aurva who was desirous of children. She deemed

							rite; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed were four sons
							born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good
							councillor. He, who knowing thus offers the four-night rite, has four
							sons born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good
							councillor. The Pavamana (Stomas) which are twenty-fourfold are
							splendour; the increasing Stomas are prosperity. Atri who had faith as
							his deity and offered sacrifices was not visited by the four strengths,
							brilliance, power, splendour, food. He saw these four Soma libations
							with the four Stomas; he grasped them and sacrificed with them. He won
							brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the
							third, food with the fourth. He, who knowing thus, grasps the four Soma
							libations with the four Stomas and sacrifices with them, wins
							brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the
							third, food with the fourth. With the success which Atri had, the
							sacrificer prospers.

							offers the five-night rite gains offspring. The seasons being created
							were not distinguished. They saw this five-night rite. They grasped it
							and sacrificed with it. Then they were distinguished; verily he stands
							firm in the year with its five seasons. Again the Pankti has five
							elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice.
							There is an Agnistoma characterized by the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he
							wins brilliance. There is a Pañcadaça (Stoma); verily he wins power.
							There is a Saptadaça (Stoma), for the obtainment of food; verily also
							he gains offspring by reason of it. There is an Agnistoma with the
							Pañcadaça (Stoma), for the gaining of Prajapati; (it has) the
							characteristics of the Mahavrata, for the gaining of food. There is a
							Viçvajit Atiratra, with all the Prstha (Stotras), for the winning of

							The Sadhya gods, desirous of heaven, saw this (rite) of six nights.
							They grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they go to the
							world of heaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of six
							nights, go to the world of heaven. (The rite) of six nights is a Sattra
							of the gods, for these Prsthas are obvious. Those, who knowing thus
							perform (the rite) of six nights, mount evidently upon the gods. (The
							rite) is of six nights; the seasons are six, the Prsthas are six. They
							go with the Sarasvati. This is the path that goes to the gods; verily
							they mount upon it. They go calling aloud; verily fastening misfortune
							on another they attain support. When ten (cows) make a hundred, then is
							one time to stop. Man is of a hundred (years of) life and of a hundred
							powers; verily in life and power do they find support. When a hundred
							make a thousand, then is one time to stop. Yonder world is measured by
							a thousand; verily they conquer yonder world. If one of them perish or
							they be oppressed, then is one time to stop, for that is a suitable
							opportunity.

							(Stoma); verily he wins brilliance, the last day would be as when one
							sits down to a cow which has already been milked; it would not be good
							enough for even a single night (rite). In the preceding days they
							perform the Brhat and the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth),
							the Brhat yonder (sky); verily they depart not from them; verily also
							in them do they find support. In that they perform the Prsthas in the
							Viçvajit in the obvious manner, it is as when one milks a cow which is
							ready to give.

							(Stoma); verily he wins brilliance. There is a Pañcadaça (Stoma);
							verily he wins power. There is a Saptadaça (Stoma), for the winning of

							There is an Agnistoma with the Pañcadaça (Stoma), to obtain Prajapati;

							indeed was he able to help offspring, When offspring are ahungered, one
							should sacrifice with (the rite) of nine nights, for these worlds are
							not fitted for them, and thus they are ahungered; verily he makes these
							worlds fitted for them, and as they become fitted he becomes fit for
							offspring along with them; these worlds become fit for him. (The rite)
							is of nine nights; verily in order he places brilliance on him. If a
							man be a long time ill, he should sacrifice with (the rite) of nine
							nights; for his breaths are loosened, and thus is he ill long; verily
							he supports his breaths in him, and even if his life be gone, yet he

							verily he creates by the Daçahotr (the rite) of ten nights, and by (the
							rite) of ten nights he is propagated. The sacrifice of ten nights is
							connected with the Viraj. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the
							rite) of ten nights, attains the Viraj. The sacrifice of ten nights is
							connected with Prajapati. There is an Ukthya with the Ekavinça (Stoma),
							and verses addressed to the sun, for support; verily he places radiance

							verses addressed to Prajapati, (called) the added oblation; verily he
							is invited by all. There are two Agnistomas, with the Trinava (Stoma)
							on either side (of the Ukthya), with verses addressed to Indra, for

							The seasons, desirous of offspring, could not procure offspring. They

							offspring, may we possess offspring.' They saw this (rite) of eleven
							nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they
							create offspring, win offspring, procure offspring, and possess
							offspring. They became the seasons, and that is why the seasonal
							periods are seasonal periods. They are the children of the seasons, and
							therefore, splendour is connected with the Gayatri; verily in the
							Gayatri and in splendour they find support. There is a Catucçatvarinça;
							the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily in
							the Tristubh and in power they find support. There is an
							Astacatvarinça; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are
							connected with the Jagati; verily in the Jagati and in cattle they find
							support. (The rite) is of eleven nights, the seasons are five, the
							seasonal periods are five; verily in the seasons, in the seasonal
							periods, and in the year they find support and win offspring. There are
							Atiratras on either side, to secure offspring.

							He should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first if he desire, 'May my
							offspring accord in order of seniority.' Offspring are in accord
							according to the arrangement of the sacrifice, and if the sacrifice is
							disarranged, they are at discord. Verily he makes his offspring in
							accord in order of seniority; the younger does not overstep the older.
							He should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first for one who is ill. For
							he who is ill is separated from breath, the cup for Indra and Vayu is
							breath; verily he unites him with breath. They should draw the cup for
							Mitra and Varuna first if when they are consecrated one die; verily
							with speech he yokes him. 'May we go not through thee to joyless
							fields', he says. The joyless fields are those of death; verily he goes
							not to the fields of death. He should draw full cups for one who is
							ill. Pain afflicts the breaths of him who is ill, the cups are breaths;
							verily he frees his breaths from pain, and even if his life is gone,
							yet he lives. He should draw full cups if rain does not fall. Pain
							afflicts the breaths of the people if rain does not fall, the cups are
							breaths; verily he frees the breaths of the people from pain, and rain
							soon falls.

							(The cup) for Indra and Vayu is connected with the Gayatri, the opening
							day is connected with the Gayatri, and therefore on the opening day
							(the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn; verily he draws it in its own
							abode. The Çukra is connected with the Tristubh, the second day is
							connected with the Tristubh, and therefore on the second day the Çukra
							is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The Agrayana is
							connected with the Jagati, the third day is connected with the Jagati,
							and therefore on the third day the Agrayana is drawn; verily he draws
							it in its own abode. In that it completes the metres, it completes the
							sacrifice, (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on this (day);
							therefore the Çukra is drawn on the seventh day, the abode of (the cup)
							for Indra and Vayu. The sixth day is the abode of the Agrayana, the
							Çukra is drawn on this (day); therefore the Agrayana is drawn on the
							eighth day, the abode of the Çukra. Verily thus does he exchange the
							metres, and he who knows thus obtains interchange with the richer;
							verily also he causes concord in the sacrifice for the gods. Therefore
							one gives this to another.

							Prajapati desired, 'May I be propagated.' He saw this (rite) of twelve
							nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was he
							propagated. He who desires, 'May I be propagated', should sacrifice
							with (the rite) of twelve nights; verily he is propagated. The
							theologians say, 'The sacrifices have Agnistomas at the beginning; why
							then is Atiratra first employed?' The two Atiratras are the eyes of the
							sacrifice, the two Agnistomas the pupils; if. The twelve nights' (rite)
							is Prajapati in twelve divisions. The two sides are the Atiratras, the
							eight Ukthyas within are the body; Prajapati in such guise touches
							truth with the Sattra, truth is the breaths; verily he touches the
							breaths. Those who perform the Sattra perform it with the breath of all
							people, and therefore they ask, 'Are these performers of a Sattra?'
							Dear to people and noble is he who knows thus.

							This (rite) with a Vaiçvanara on one side (only) was not able to win
							the world of heaven; it was stretched upwards and the gods piled round
							this Vaiçvanara, to overcome the world of heaven. The seasons made
							Prajapati sacrifice with it, and in them because of it he prospered. He
							prospers among the priests who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite)
							of twelve days. They were desirous of obtaining (their desires) from
							him. He gave to the spring the sap, with the third three he cleanses
							the vessels, and with the fourth three he purifies himself within. He
							who eats his victim, eats his flesh, who eats his sacrificial cake,
							eats his brains, who eats his fried grain, eats his excrement, who eats
							his ghee, eats his marrow, who eats his Soma, eats his sweat, and also
							he eats the excrements from his head, who accepts (a present) at the
							twelve-day (rite). Therefore one should not cause one to sacrifice with
							the twelve-day (rite), to avert evil.

							They go swiftly in that it is the tenth day. In that it is the tenth
							day they loosen their sins. He who among men going swiftly falls in
							with a trackless way, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are
							left out. So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief,
							is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he
							seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who
							pointed out (his error) is left out should point out (his error). If
							there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within
							the Sadas. If there be none there, then it should be pointed out by the
							Grhapati. At any rate it should be pointed out. They sing the verses of
							the serpent queen on that day. The queen of what creeps is this
							(earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever they have
							praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now whatever
							they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter, (it
							is done thinking), 'Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.'
							They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a
							mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in
							one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the
							Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the
							Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he
							should declare to the one who responds. That is the response.

							The theologians say, 'By the first day of the twelve-day rite what is
							it that the sacrificer takes from the priests?' 'Brilliance and power'
							is (the answer). 'What by the second?' 'The breaths and food.' 'What by
							the third?' 'These three worlds.' 'What by the fourth?' 'Four-footed
							cattle.' 'What by the fifth?' 'The Pankti with its elements.' 'What by
							the sixth?' 'The six seasons.' 'What by the seventh?' 'The Çakvari with
							its seven feet.' 'What by the eighth?' 'The Gayatri with its eight
							syllables.' 'What by the ninth?' 'The Trivrt Stoma.' 'What by the
							tenth?' 'The Viraj with its ten syllables.' 'What by the eleventh?'
							'The Tristubh with its eleven syllables.' 'What by the twelfth?' 'The
							Jagati with its twelve syllables.' So much is there as that. So much as
							that he takes from them.

							(The rite) of thirteen nights is a complete (rite of) twelve days, for
							the opening and concluding days are the same. There are three
							Atiratras, three are these worlds, for the obtaining of these worlds.
							The first Atiratra is the expiration, the second cross-breathing, the
							third inspiration; verily they find support in expiration, inspiration,
							out-breathing, and food, and reach their full life, who knowing thus
							perform (the rite) of thirteen nights. They say, '(The rite) of twelve
							days is the sequence of speech. They would cleave it if they put an
							Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder would be
							liable to fail.' They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas; verily
							they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder
							is not likely to fail. The Chandomas are cattle, the Mahavrata food; in
							that they perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support
							in cattle and in food.

							The Adityas desired, 'May we be prosperous in both worlds.' They saw
							this (rite) of fourteen nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with
							it. Then indeed they prospered in both worlds, this and yonder. Those,
							who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fourteen nights, prosper in both
							worlds, this and yonder. (The rite) is of fourteen nights, there are
							seven domesticated plants and seven wild; (verily it serves) to win
							both. In that the Prsthas are performed in succession, they conquer by
							them yonder world. In that the Prsthas are reversed, they conquer by
							them this world. There are two Trayastrinça Stomas in the middle;
							verily they attain sovereignty. (These two) are overlords; verily they
							become overlords of their peers. There are Atiratras on either side,
							for security.

							Prajapati went to the world of heaven. The gods followed him, and the
							Adityas and the cattle followed them. The gods said, 'The cattle on
							which we have lived have followed us.' They arranged this (rite) of
							fourteen nights away for them. The Adityas mounted the world of heaven
							with the Prsthas; they arranged the cattle in this world with the two
							Tryahas. By means of the Prsthas the Adityas prospered in yonder world,
							the cattle in this world by the Tryahas. The Prsthas are force and
							strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They
							proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is
							this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed;
							verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths
							of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of

							Indra was on a level with the gods, he was not distinguished from them.
							He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights. He
							grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became distinguished
							from the other gods. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite) of
							fifteen nights attain distinction from the evil enemy. The three days
							are Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the
							atmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they find support in these
							worlds. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that
							there axe Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the
							Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and
							strength, the strength, and in cattle, they Chandomas cattle; verily in
							force and find support. (The rite) is of fifteen nights; the bolt is
							fifteenfold; verily they hurl the bolt at their enemies. There are
							Atiratras on either side, for securing power.

							Indra was as it were loose and unfixed. He was afraid of the Asuras. He
							ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights as a
							bolt. With it he overcame and conquered the Asuras and attained
							prosperity. By the Agnistut he burned away the evil, by (the rite) of
							fifteen nights he placed force, might, power, and strength in himself.
							Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights overcome
							and conquer their enemies and attain prosperity. By the Agnistut they
							burn away the evil. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from
							earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed,
							for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in
							either world they cease (the rite). These (nights) are fifteen. As for
							ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by
							the Viraj they win food. As for five, the quarters are five; verily
							they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on either side,
							for securing power, strength, offspring, and cattle.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 3: Verse 8
					-
						-
							Prajapati desired, 'May I be an eater of food.' He saw this (rite of)
							seventeen nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he
							became an eater of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of
							seventeen nights, become eaters of food. There is a period of five
							days; the seasons are five in the year; verily in the seasons and the
							year they find sup port. Again the Pankti is of five elements, the
							sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the sacrifice. There can be no
							Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there
							is the sacrifice. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the
							Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle;
							verily in force and strength, and in cattle, they find support. (The
							rite is) of seventeen nights; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it
							serves) to obtain Prajapati. There are Atiratras on either side, for
							securing food.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 3: Verse 9

						-
							The Viraj dividing itself stayed among the gods with the holy power
							(Brahman), among the Asuras with food. The gods desired, 'May we
							acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food! They saw (the rite of)
							these twenty nights. Then indeed they acquired both the holy power
							(Brahman) and food, and became resplendent and eaters of food. Those,
							who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these nights, acquire both the
							holy power (Brahman) and food. If the Prsthas were on one side there
							would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance.
							The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and
							strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara
							(Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);
							verily with them do they proceed, verily also in them they find
							support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by
							them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of
							heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in
							succession. The Tryaha is re versed, for the return (from heaven), and
							for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite).
							There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour and food.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 3: Verse 10

						-
							Yonder sun was in this world. The gods surrounded it with the Prsthas
							and removed it to the world of heaven. They surrounded it from below
							with the Para (Samans), and placed it with the Divakirtya (Saman) in
							the world of heaven. They surrounded it from above with the Para
							(Samans), and with the Prsthas they descended (from heaven). Yonder sun
							indeed in yonder world is surrounded by the Para (Samans) on both
							sides. In that there are Prsthas the sacrificers go by them to the
							world of heaven; they surround it from below with the Para (Samans),
							and by the Divakirtya (Saman) find support, the sacrificers would
							either go mad or perish. In that the Prsthas are reversed they descend
							to this world with them; verily also they find support in this world,
							for sanity. Indra was unsettled. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him
							this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with
							it. Then indeed he became settled. Those, who sacrifice much and are
							unsettled, should perform (the rite) of twenty-one nights. There are
							twelve months, five seasons, three worlds here, and yonder sun as the
							twenty-first. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in
							order they find support. Yonder sun did not shine. He ran up to
							Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it,
							and sacrificed with it. Then in deed did he shine. Those, who knowing
							thus perform (the rite) of twenty one nights, shine also. (The rite) is
							of twenty-one nights, the Ekavinça (Stoma) is radiance; verily they
							attain radiance, and support also, for the Ekavinça is support. There
							are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour.

							Brhaspati desired, 'May the gods have faith in me, and may I become

							it, and sacrificed with it. Then the gods had faith in him, and he
							became their Purohita. In those who knowing thus perform the twenty
							four night (rite) men have faith, and they become their Purohitas.
							There are the three days Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this
							(earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky) proceed;
							verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths
							of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of
							heaven. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty four
							half-months make up the year; the year is the world of heaven; verily
							they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is
							of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the
							Gayatri they win splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to

							As are men, so were the gods in the beginning. They desired, 'Let us

							the gods.' They saw this twenty-four night (rite); they grasped it, and
							sacrificed with it. Then they struck off the misfortune, the evil of
							death, and reached the conclave of the gods. Those who knowing thus
							perform the twenty-four night (rite) strike off the misfortune, the
							evil, and win prosperity, for the conclave of the gods is in the case
							of man proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven
							turning away (from earth) who perform the Prsthas in succession. The
							six-day (rite) is reversed for the return (from the heaven), and for
							support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). They
							go from a Trivrt to a Trivrt, for the attainment of the Stomas, for pre
							eminence. There is an Agnistoma in the Jyotis form. This dwelling is
							this (world); verily by reason thereof they depart not from this
							dwelling. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty-four
							half-months make up the year, the year is the world of heaven; verily
							they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is
							of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the

							This (earth) was bare and hairless. It desired, 'Let me be propagated

							placing it within itself it won food, plants. Those who knowing thus
							perform (the rite of) these (nights) have both offspring and cattle.
							These go imperfect to the world of heaven, for they resort to various
							Stomas; in that the Stomas are arranged in order, they go in order to

							by the Viraj they win food. There are Atiratras on either hand, to

							Prajapati went to the world of heaven. But with whatever metre the gods

							connected with the Anustubh; verily having gained Prajapati by his own
							metre they mounted on him and went to the world of heaven. Those who
							knowing thus perform (the rite of) these thirty-two (nights)--the
							Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is connected with the
							Anustubh-gaining Prajapati by his own metre, go to prosperity. The
							Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do
							they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are
							the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the
							world of heaven. Those who perform the three days in succession mount
							upon the world of heaven turning away (from earth). There is a three
							day period reversed, for returning (from heaven), and also for support.
							Having prospered in both worlds they cease (the rite). These (nights)
							are thirty-two. As for thirty of them, the Viraj has thirty syllables,
							the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for the
							(remaining) two, they are days and nights, and by both forms they go to
							the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.

							There are two Sattras of the gods, that of twelve days and that of

							thirty-three days, mount openly upon the deities. As a great man who
							has reached (the goal) seeks (more), so he does. If he fail he becomes
							worse; if he fail not, he remains the same. Those, who knowing thus
							perform (the rite of) thirty-three days, are distinguished from the
							evil enemy. The gods in the beginning seized these (nights), sharing
							the days by means of a ten-nights' (rite) did Prajapati create
							offspring. In that there is a ten-nights' (rite), the sacrificers
							create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has declared the ten-night rite to
							be the prosperity of the Sattra. In that there is a ten-nights' rite,
							(it serves) for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is
							wrongly done in the former days, it serves to atone. These nights form
							two rows, the sacrificers are the Viçvajit, the first are sixteen with
							the Atiratra, the second are sixteen with the Atiratra. To those, who
							knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-three days, are born children
							in two rows. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.

							The Adityas desired, 'Let us go to the world of heaven.' They discerned

							world of heaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty
							six nights, discern the world of heaven, and go to the world of heaven.
							The Atiratra is light and strength they find support. (The rite has)
							thirty-six nights; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are
							connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati they win cattle. The
							Brhati obtained the sovereignty over the metres. They obtain
							sovereignty who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-six nights;
							verily they go to the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either
							side, for the securing of the world of heaven.

							Vasistha, his sons slain, desired, 'May I win offspring, and defeat the

							sacrificed with it. Then indeed did he win offspring and defeated the
							Sauddsas. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine
							nights, win offspring and defeat their enemies. There are three
							Agnistomas with the Trivrt; verily they sharpen the point of the bolt.
							There are ten Pañcadaças; the bolt is fifteenfold. There are many
							Sodaçins, for conquest. There are six (days) with the Açvina (Çastra),
							six are the seasons; verily they rest on the seasons. These nights are
							deficient and redundant. They are deficient in that they are fifty less
							one, redundant in that they are (one) more than forty-eight. Both from
							the deficient, indeed, and from the redundant Prajapati was propagated.
							Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform (the rite of)
							these nights; verily are they propagated with offspring and cattle.
							This sacrifice is connected with the Viraj because it is one of
							forty-nine (nights). Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of
							forty-nine nights, attain the Viraj, and become eaters of food. There
							are Atiratras on either side, for the securing of food.

							Those who are about to consecrate themselves for the year (rite) should

							year; on that night he dwells with her; verily they consecrate
							themselves grasping openly the year. Those who consecrate themselves on
							the Ekastaka consecrate themselves in the troubled part of the year,
							for then are the two months called the end. Those who consecrate
							themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate themselves on the torn part of
							the year, for them are the two seasons called the end. They should
							consecrate themselves on the full moon in Phalguni. The full moon in
							Phalguni is the beginning of the year the pressing-(day) falls on the
							first half (of the month), the months end in the first half, they
							complete (the rite) in the first half, and when they complete the rite
							the plants and trees come out after them. And after them follows the
							fair report, 'These sacrificers have succeeded', and therefore all
							succeed.

							with two their flesh, with two their bones, with two their marrow. In
							the Sattra the self is the sacrificial gift; verily taking the self as
							the gift they go to the world of heaven. They cut off the top-knot, for
							prosperity, (thinking), 'More swiftly may we attain the world of
							heaven.'

							The theologians say, 'The Atiratra is the highest of the forms of

							perform in order first the Agnistoma, then the Ukthya, then the
							Sodaçin, then the Atiratra, all the forms of sacrifice, and seizing and
							holding them, they keep drinking the Soma. They perform the Jyotistoma
							first; the Jyotistoma is the beginning of the Stomas; verily they
							commence the Stomas from the beginning. The Stomas being sung together
							make up the Viraj, and two verses are redundant; the Gostoma has one
							too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the world of
							heaven, the Viraj is strength; verily by it they go to the world of
							heaven. 'The Rathantara is used in the day, the Rathantara at night',
							say the theologians, 'what is used to avoid repetition?' The great
							Saman of Sobhari is used as the Brahmasaman at the third pressing; it
							they place in the middle, to separate them; verily there is no
							repetition.

							They first perform the Jyotistoma; verily by it they find support in
							this world. They perform secondly the Gostoma; verily by it they find
							support in the atmosphere. They perform thirdly the Ayustoma; verily by
							it they find support in yonder world. The Jyotis is this (earth), the
							Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky). In that they perform
							these Stomas, the performers of the Sattra keep finding support in
							these worlds. These, (Stomas) being sung together make up the Viraj.
							Therefore (the days) follow man. There are three Sadahas, they make up
							eighteen days, nine and nine. Nine are the breaths in man; verily they
							follow the breaths. There are four Sadahas, they make up twenty-four
							days. The year consists of twenty-four half-months; verily they follow
							the year. 'The year is not fixed', they say. 'It is greater than a
							support.' The Brahmana of the month is that of the year also verily
							they go finding support in each month.

								The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless, with the desire,
								'May horns be born to us.' For ten months they performed it, and
								then horns were born, and they ceased (the rite), (saying), 'We
								have obtained (our desire).' Then those whose horns were not born
								ceased (the rite) after making up the year, (saying), 'We have
								obtained (our desire).' Both those which obtained horns and those
								which did not ceased, (saying),'We have obtained (our desire).' The
								year is the cows' Sattra; verily as they go on they find support in
								the year. There are three hundred and sixty Stotriyas; so many are
								the nights of the year; verily they attain both forms of the year.

						-
							Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 1: Line 2

								They perform (the rites of) the next days for rest, for safety.
								There are six-day periods. The year has six seasons; verily they
								find support in the seasons, the year. The Go and the Ayus (Stomas)
								are the Stomas in the middle; verily they place a pair in the
								middle of the year. There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the
								world of the gods; verily they leave not the world of the gods.
								There are used various verses. The verses are the world of man;
								verily they keep mounting one world of gods after another from the
								world of men. There is the Brahman's Saman as the Abhivarta to win
								the world of heaven. There is the Abhijit (day) for the gaining of
								the world of heaven. There is the Viçvajit (day) for the gaining of
								all. Month by month they perform the Prsthas, month by month the
								Atigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month they place strength, for
								the support of the months. They perform the Prsthas in the latter
								part of the month. Therefore it is on the top that the plants bear
								fruit.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 2

							The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless and desiring to obtain
							horns. For ten months they performed it, and then horns appeared. They
							said, 'We have gained (them), let us cease (the rite), for we have
							attained the desire for the sake of which we began (the rite).' But
							others said, either half of them or as many as might be the case, 'Let
							us perform (the rite) for these months, the eleventh and the twelfth,
							and when we have made up the year, let us cease'. In their case their
							horns grew in the twelfth month. Whether by faith, or by lack of
							faith-that is, those which have no horns-both indeed were prosperous,
							those which gained horns and those which won strength. He who ceases
							after ten months is prosperous, and he who ceases after twelve also, if
							he knows thus. They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot
							attains (what he seeks). The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it
							productive of cows.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 3

							They perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the
							middle month, they perform them in the last month. They say, 'In the
							case of a cow which they milk thrice a day, she yields sparingly at the
							latter two milkings; how then can she be milked who is twelve times
							milked?' Having made up the year, they should perform the Prsthas once
							in the last month; verily the sacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle.
							It is an ocean without a near or a further shore that they enter upon
							who perform the year (rite). If they employ the Brhat and the
							Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to provide a boat in the
							middle of the ocean. Going continuously with the Brhat and the
							Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires;
							thus the sacrificers obtain all desires.

							The Rcs are the same. The Rcs are the world of men; verily they leave
							not the world of man. There are different Samans; the Saman is the
							world of the gods; verily they descend from the world of the gods to
							one world after another of men. They first use the Jagati, and the
							metres descend from the Jagati, the cups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas
							from the Brhat, the Stomas from the Trayastrinça. Therefore the younger
							descends before an elder. The Viçvakarman cup is drawn; verily by it
							the sacrificers win all rites. The cup for Aditi is drawn. Aditi is
							this (earth); verily they rest on this (earth). The one and the other
							are drawn, for pairing, for propagation. Of old Prajapati created
							offspring by means of the ten-night (rite); in that the ten-night rite
							is performed, the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has
							declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra, and the
							ten-night rite serves for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also
							whatever is done wrongly in the earlier days, this serves to atone for
							it.

								If two libations are offered simultaneously, then one should

								others). The strophe should contain the word 'strong (vrsan)';
								verily he takes Indra away from their morning pressing. Or rather
								they say, 'The strophe at the beginning of each pressing should be
								of this kind'; verily he takes Indra away from each of their

								Entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres, he takes away
								their metres. One should recite the Sajaniya hymn; one should
								recite the Vihavya hymn; one should recite the Kayaçubhiya hymn of
								Agastya. This indeed is so much as that, verily he takes away so
								much as is theirs. If at the early pressing the bowl is broken,
								they should sing verses addressed to Visnu and containing the
								epithet Çipivista. Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is
								redundant with regard to Visnu Çipivista; verily Visnu Çipivista
								places the redundant in the redundant. Verily having obtained the
								redundant by the redundant, they win it. If it is broken at the
								midday pressing, they should make the Saman have the Vasatkara as
								its finale. The support of the sacrifice is the Vasatkara; verily
								they make the Saman obtain support. If it breaks at the third
								pressing, the same thing (should be done).

							Having made up the month with the six-day periods they leave out a day,
							for they behold the months by the six-day periods. Having made up the
							months with the half-months, they leave out a day, for they behold the
							months by the half-months. Having made up the months by the new moon
							night, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the new moon
							night. Having made up the months by the full moon night, they leave out
							a day, for they behold the month by the full moon night. He who pours
							(liquid) into a full (vessel) wastes the liquid; he who pours out from
							a full (vessel), who leave out the day. The Samnayya is the fourth
							pressing. Because there is the Samnayya, they do not leave the
							pressing. They partake of it after uttering the invocation, for they
							have this then as their Soma drink. The deities who share in the
							pressings of those who leave out the day go to their places; they offer
							the sacrificial cakes in each of the pressings; verily they win the
							deities who share in the pressing from their several places. (They
							offer the cakes) on eight potsherds at the early pressing, on eleven
							potsherds at the midday pressing, and on twelve potsherds at the third
							pressing; verily they obtain and win the metres. They offer an oblation
							to the All-gods at the third pressing. The third pressing belongs to
							the All-gods; verily they leave not the third pressing.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 7

						-
							The theologians consider, 'Should (a day) be left out, or should it not
							be left out?' They say, 'It should be left out.' They say, 'It should
							be left out at the new moon and at the full moon, for these two guide
							the sacrifice.' 'These two must not be left out,' they say, 'for these
							two determine the dependent sacrifice.' '(The day) should be left out
							on the first Vyastaka,' they say, 'for this is what rends the month.'
							They should not leave out a day which is appointed. The third pressing
							belongs to the All-gods with the Rbhus. In that they offer to the
							All-gods a cake on twelve pot sherds, they make the gods share in it,
							and they approach the pressing with twelve. They offer a beast to
							Prajapati-Prajapati is the sacrifice that the sacrifice may not be
							abandoned. For six months (as they go) hence the Brahman's Saman should
							be the 'victorious'. The 'victorious' is the holy power (Brahman);
							verily they go winning the world of heaven by the holy power (Brahman);
							for the world of heaven is as it were opposite from hence. When they
							come thence the Brahman's Saman for six months should be 'O Indra, bear
							us strength, as a father to his sons. Guide us, O thou that art much
							invoked, on our path. Living, may we attain the light.' The light is
							this world, the light is offspring; verily they come, gazing on this
							world by repeating the verse.

							When the gods had come to the end, their power and strength departed.
							They won them again by the Kroça (Saman), and that is why the Kroça has
							the name. In that they sing the Kroça at the end of the pit, they win
							power and strength at the end of the sacrifice. They sing the Sattra
							syarddhi (Saman) at the end of the Ahavaniya; verily, making Agni a
							witness, they advance to prosperity. They sing the Prajapater Hrdaya
							within the shed; verily they win his favour. They sing the Çloka
							(Saman) in front of the Sadas they place glory in themselves. Therefore
							one breath protects all the limbs. Therefore, just as a bird about to
							fly upwards raises its head aloft, so the sacrificers are highest among
							people. The Udgatr mounts a throne; verily they attain rule. The Hotr
							(mounts) a swing; verily they mount the back of the firmament. The
							Adhvaryu (mounts) two mats; verily they reach the surface of the ruddy
							one. So many indeed are the worlds, and in them in order they find
							support. Then the sacrificers make thus a bridge to mount, for the
							gaining of the world of heaven.

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 9

						-
							By means of the Arkya (Saman) Prajapati created offspring in thousands.
							From them by means of the Ilamda (Saman) he took away the food they had
							gathered. In that there is the Arkya, the sacrificers create offspring;
							in that there is the Ilamda, they take away from the offspring which
							has been created the food they have gathered. Therefore, in whatever
							year the Sattra is performed, the offspring are hungry in that year,
							for they take their food and strength; in whatever year the Sattra is
							imperfect, the offspring are not hungry in that year; for they take not
							their food and strength. They raise a loud noise. As men being freed
							from bonds cry aloud, so the sacrificers freed from the bonds of the
							gods cry aloud, placing food and strength in themselves. The lute has a
							hundred strings. Man is of a hundred (years) of age, and of a
							hundredfold strength; verily they find support in age and strength.
							They run a race, to win what has not yet been won. They beat drums; the
							voice of the drum is the highest (form of) speech; verily they win the
							highest (form of) speech. They beat the earth-drum; verily they win
							that speech which has entered this (earth); verily also they conquer
							the earth. All (forms of) speech they utter, to gain all (forms of
							speech). Two strive on a dry hide, to gain strength. One reviles,
							another extols. He who reviles purifies them, he who extols places food
							in them after they are purified. They win by the first months what is
							done by the Rsis and by the gods; in that the Bhutechad Samans are
							used, both are gained. Those who perform the year rite lose their
							virility. There are a pair united within the sacrificial ground; verily
							they lose not virility.

							They pierce the hide; verily they remove the sin of the (sacrificers).

							on their heads, beating the ground with their feet, and singing 'This
							is honey.' Honey indeed is the chiefest food of the gods; verily they
							win the chiefest food. They beat the ground with their feet; verily
							they endow the (sacrificers) with might.

							Now for the fire which is produced on the fire-altar and for Soma, the

							which is piled up is cruel, and if one were not to cast upon the fire
							which has been piled up these oblations, the cruel fire would spring up
							in wrath, and injure the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. In
							that he casts the oblations on the fire which has been piled up, he
							appeases it with its own portion, and the cruel fire. In that he casts
							these oblations, (it is) for the winning of the quarters. The gods made
							Indra sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Indra's pressing; men made
							Manu sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Manu's pressing. As Indra
							among the gods, as Manu among men, becomes he who knowing thus
							sacrifices with this sacrifice. The Puronuvakyas contain the word
							'quarter', for the conquest of the quarters.

							He who knows the head of the sacrificial horse becomes possessed of a
							head and fit for sacrifice. The head of the sacrificial horse is the
							dawn, the eye the sun, the breath the wind, the ear the moon, the feet
							the quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the winking the day
							and night, the joints the half-months, the joinings the months, the
							limbs the seasons, the trunk the year, the hair the rays (of the gun),
							the form the Naksatras, the bones the stars, the flesh the mist, the
							hair the plants, the tail hairs the trees, the mouth Agni, the open
							(mouth) Vaiçvanara, the belly the sea, the anus the atmosphere, the
							testicles the sky and the earth, the membrum virile, the
							pressing-stone, the seed the Soma. When it chews, there is lightning;
							when it moves about, there is thundering; when it makes water, there is
							rain; its speech is speech. The Mahiman (cup) indeed is born before the
							birth of the horse as the day. The Mahiman (cup) is born after it as
							the night. These two Mahiman (cups) surround on either side the horse.
							As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Arvan (courser) the Asuras, as
							Vajin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Açva (horse) men. The birthplace of
							the horse, indeed, is the sea, its kindred is the sea.
