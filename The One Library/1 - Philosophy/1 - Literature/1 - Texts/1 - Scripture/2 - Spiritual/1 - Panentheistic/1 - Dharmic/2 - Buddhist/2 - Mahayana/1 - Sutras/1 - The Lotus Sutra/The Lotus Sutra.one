					are inconceivable and rare events. Who should I ask concerning them? Who could
					answer?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 26
			-
				-
					He further thought: "The Dharma Prince, Manjushri, has in the past drawn near

			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 27
			-
				-
					Thereupon the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and Upasikas, as well as the

					penetrations?"

				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 29
			-
				-
					"What are the reasons for these portents, these signs of spiritual
					penetrations, for the emanation of great light which illumines eighteen
					thousand lands to the east so that the adornments in all those Buddha worlds
					are fully seen?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 30
			-
				-
					Thereupon, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke verses
					asking:
				-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 30: Line 1
				-
					-
						"Manjushri, what is the reason

				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 30: Line 2

				-
					-
						trembles in six different ways.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 30: Line 13
				-
					-
						Then the four-fold multitude
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 30: Line 14
				-
					-
						rejoices altogether;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 30: Line 15
				-
					-
						in body and in mind enpaptured,

				-
					-
						The bright light from between the brows
					-
				-

					Honored One, now wishes to speak the great Dharma, to let fall the great Dharma
					rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, and to
					proclaim the great Dharma doctrine."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"Good men, I have, in the past, in the presence of other Buddhas, seen such
					portents. Having emitted this light, they immediately spoke the great Dharma.
					Therefore, it should be known that the manifestation of light by the present
					Buddha is also thus. Because he wishes to lead all living beings to hear and
					understand this Dharma which in the whole world is hard to believe, he
					therefore manifests these portents."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"Good men, it is jsut as in the past, limitless, boundless, inconceivable
					Asankhyeya aeons ago, there was at that time a Buddha named Brightness of

					Universal knowledge, One of Perfect Clarity and Conduct, Well-Gone One, an
					Unsurpassed Knight who Understands the World, a Hero Who Subdues and Tames, a
					Teacher of Gods and People, the Buddha, the World Honored One who expounded the
					proper Dharma, good at its beginning, good in its middle, and good at its end,

				Chapter 1: Verse 34
			-
				-
					"To those who sought to be Sound-Hearers, he responded with the Dharma of the
					Four Truths, by which one crosses over birth, aging, sickness, and death to the
					ultimate Nirvana; to those who sought to be Pratyeka Buddhas, he responded with
					the Dharma of the Twelve Conditioned Causes; for the sake of the Bodhisattvas,
					he responded with the Six Paramitas, causing them to attain
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi and realize the wisdom of all modes."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 35
			-
				-
					"Then, there was another Buddha, also named Brightness of Sun-Moon-Lamp, and

				-
					"Before the last Buddha left the home-life, he had eight royal sons. The first
					was named Intention, the second, Good Intention, the third, Limitless
					Intention, the fourth Jeweled Intention, the fifth, Increasing Intention; the
					sixth, Intention Rid of Doubt, the seventh, Resounding Intention, and the
					eighth, Dahrma Intention. The eight princes were of awesome virtue and

				Chapter 1: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"When the princes head that their father had left the home-life and attained

				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 39
			-
				-
					"At that time, the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness spoke a Great Vehicle Sutra
					named The Limitless Principles, a Dharma for instructing Bodhisattvas of which
					the Buddhas are protective and mindful. When he had finished speaking that
					Sutra, he then, in the midst of the assembly, sat in full lotus and entered the
					Samadhi of the Station of Limitless Principles; his body and mind were
					unmoving. Then from the heavens there fell a rain of Mandarava flowers,
					Mahamandarava flowers, Manjushaka flowers, and Mahamanjushaks flowers, which
					were scattered upon the Buddha and the entire great assembly. All the Buddha
					universes quaked in six ways. At that time the entire great assembly of
					Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, Upasikas, gods, dragons, Yakshas, Gandharvas,
					Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, beings human and non-human as well as the
					minor kings and the wheel-turning sage kings and so forth, all attained what
					they had never had before. The rejoiced and joined their palms and, with one
					heart, gazed upon the Buddha. Then the Thus Come One emitted from between his
					brows a white hair-mark light which illumined eighteen thousand Buddha-worlds
					to the east, omitting none of them. Just like all the Buddha lands now seen."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 40
			-
				-
					"Maitreya, it should be known that there were at that time in the assembly
					twenty million Bodhisattvas who took delight in listening to the Dharma. Upon
					seeing this bright light illumine all the Buddha lands, all the Bodhisattvas
					obtained what they had never had and wished to know the causes and conditions
					for this light."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 41
			-
				-
					"There was at that time a Bodhisattva by the name of Wondrous Light who had
					eight hundred disciples. The Buddha Brightness of Sun-Moon-Lamp then arose from
					Samadhi and, for the sake of the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light, spoke a Great
					Vehicle Sutra called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, a Dharma for
					instructing Bodhisattvas of which the Buddha is protective and mindful.
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 42
			-
				-
					"For sixty small aeons he did not rise from his seat. Those assembled listening
					also sat in one place for sixty small aeons with bodies and minds unmoving,
					listening to what the Buddha said as if it were but the space of a meal. At
					that time, in the assembly, there was not a single person who grew weary,
					either physically or mentally."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 43
			-
				-
					"At the end of sixty small aeons, having finished speaking the Stura, the
					Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness immediately announced to the assembly of
					Brahma, Mara, Shramanas, Brahmans, gods, humans, and Asuras, 'Today, at
					midnight, the Thus Come One will enter Nirvana without residue.' There was at
					that time a Bodhisattva by the name of Virtue Treasury to whom the Buddha
					Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness transmitted a prediction, telling all the Bhikshus,
					"The Bodhisattva Virtue Treasury will next become a Buddha with the name of
					Pure-Body-Tathagato rhan, Samyaksambuddhah. After that Buddha had transmitted
					the prediction, at midnight he entered Nirvana without residue."

				Chapter 1: Verse 44
			-
				-
					"Following the Buddha's crossing over into extinction, the Bodhisattva Wondrous
					Light upheld the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra for a full eighty small

					Brightness all served Wondrous Light as their master.. Wondrous Light taught
					and transformed them, causing them to become firmly established in
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 45
			-
				-
					"The princes, having made offerings to limitless hundrreds of thousands of tens
					of thousands of millions of Buddhas, all realized the Buddha Way. The very last
					to become a Buddha was one named Burner of the Lamp."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 46
			-
				-
					"Among the eight hundred disciples was one named Seeker of Fame, who was
					greedily attached to profit and offerings. Although he read and recited many
					scriptures, he did not comprehend them and forgot most of what he learned. For
					that reasons he was called Seeker of Fame. Because he had also planted good
					roots, he was able to encounter limitless hundreds of thousands of tens of
					thousands of millions of Buddhas, making offerings to them and honoring them,
					venerating and praising them."
				-
			-
				Chapter 1: Verse 47
			-
				-
					"Maitreya, it should be known, could the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light have been

				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 9
				-
					-
						Before that Buddha had left home,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 10
				-
					-
						The eight royal sons born to him,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 11
				-
					-
						Seeing the Great Sage leave him home,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 12
				-
					-
						Also followed him to practice Brahman conduct.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 13
				-
					-
						The Buddha then spoke a Great Vehicle
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 14
				-
					-
						Sutra by the name of Limitless Principles;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 15
				-
					-
						Amidst the assembly, and for their sake,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 16
				-
					-
						He set it forth in extensive detail.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 17
				-
					-
						When the Buddha had finished speaking the Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 18
				-
					-
						Seated in the Dharma-seat,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 19
				-
					-
						He sat in full lotus and entered the Samadhi
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 20
				-
					-
						Called the Station of Limitless Principles.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 21
				-
					-
						From the heavens fell a rain of Mandarava flowers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 22
				-
					-
						And heavenly drums of themselves did sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 23
				-
					-
						While all the gods, dragons, ghosts and spirits,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 24
				-
					-
						Made offerings to the Honored One;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 25
				-
					-
						And, within all the Buddha lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 26
				-
					-
						There occurred a mighty trembling.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 27
				-
					-
						The light emitted from between the Buddha's brows
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 28
				-
					-
						Manifested all these rare events.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 29
				-
					-
						The light illumined to the east
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 30
				-
					-
						Eighteen thousand Buddha lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 31
				-
					-
						Revealing the places of living beings'
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 32
				-
					-
						Karmic retributions of birth and death.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 33
				-
					-
						Seen, too, were Buddha lands adorned
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 34
				-
					-
						With a multitude of gems,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 35
				-
					-
						The color of lapiz lazuli and crystal,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 36
				-
					-
						Illumined by the Buddha's light.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 37
				-
					-
						Seen as well were gods and people,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 38
				-
					-
						Dragons, spirits, and Yaksha Hordes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 39
				-
					-
						Gandharvas and Kinnaras,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 40
				-
					-
						Each making offering to the Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 41
				-
					-
						Thus come ones, too, all were seen
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 42
				-
					-
						As they naturally accomplished the Buddha Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 43
				-
					-
						Their bodies' hue like mountains of gold,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 44
				-
					-
						Upright, serene, subtle, and fine,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 45
				-
					-
						As, within pure lapis lazuli
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 46
				-
					-
						Would appear an image of real gold.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 47
				-
					-
						The World Honored Ones in those assemblies
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 48
				-
					-
						Proclaimed the profound principle of the Law.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 49
				-
					-
						In all the Buddhas' lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 50
				-
					-
						Were Shravaka hosts, uncountable;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 51
				-
					-
						Through the illumination of the Buddha's light
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 52
				-
					-
						Those assemblies all were fully seen.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 53
				-
					-
						There were also Bhikshus who,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 54
				-
					-
						Dwelt within the mountain groves,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 55
				-
					-
						Vigorously upholding the pure precepts
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 56
				-
					-
						As if guarding brilliant pearls.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 57
				-
					-
						Also seen were Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 58
				-
					-
						Practicing giving, patience, and so forth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 59
				-
					-
						Their number like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 60
				-
					-
						Illumined by the Buddha's light.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 61
				-
					-
						Seen too were Bodhisattvas who
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 62
				-
					-
						Had deeply entered Dhyana Samadhi,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 63
				-
					-
						With bodies and minds still and unmoving
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 64
				-
					-
						They sought the Way unsurpassed.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 65
				-
					-
						Bodhisattvas, too, were seen who knew
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 66
				-
					-
						The Mark of Dharmas' still extinction;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 67
				-
					-
						Each one within his Buddhaland
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 68
				-
					-
						Spoke Dharma, seeking the Buddha's path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 69
				-
					-
						Then the four-fold multitudes
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 70
				-
					-
						Seeing the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 71
				-
					-
						Manifest great and powerful spiritual penetrations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 72
				-
					-
						In their hearts all rejoiced,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 73
				-
					-
						And inquired, each of the other,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 74
				-
					-
						"What is the reason for these events?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 75
				-
					-
						The Honored One, revered by gods and humans,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 76
				-
					-
						Just then from Samadhi did arise,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 77
				-
					-
						And praised the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light:
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 78
				-
					-
						"You act as eyes for the world,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 79
				-
					-
						All return to you in faith; you are
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 80
				-
					-
						Able reverently to hold the Dharma-store.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 81
				-
					-
						Dharma such as I do speak-
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 82
				-
					-
						You alone can certify to its understanding."
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 83
				-
					-
						The World Honored One having praised him,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 84
				-
					-
						And caused Wondrous Light to rejoice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 85
				-
					-
						Then spoke the Sutra of the Dharma Flower.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 86
				-
					-
						For a full sixty minor aeons
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 87
				-
					-
						He did not rise from his seat.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 88
				-
					-
						The supreme and wondrous Dharma that he spoke,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 89
				-
					-
						The Dharma Master Wondrous Light
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 90
				-
					-
						Was fully able to receive and hold.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 91
				-
					-
						The Buddha, having spoken The Dharma Flower,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 92
				-
					-
						And caused the assembly to rejoice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 93
				-
					-
						Later, on that very day,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 94
				-
					-
						Announced to the host of gods and humans;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 95
				-
					-
						"The meaning of the real mark of all Dharmas
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 96
				-
					-
						Has already been spoken for all of you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 97
				-
					-
						And now at midnight, I
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 98
				-
					-
						shall enter into Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 99
				-
					-
						You should single-heartedly advance with vigor,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 100
				-
					-
						And avoid laxness, for
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 101
				-
					-
						Buddhas are difficult indeed to meet,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 102
				-
					-
						Encountered but once in a million aeons."
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 103
				-
					-
						All of the disciples of the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 104
				-
					-
						Hearing of the Buddha's entry into Nirvana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 105
				-
					-
						Each harbored grief and anguish,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 106
				-
					-
						"Why must the Buddha take extinction so soon?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 107
				-
					-
						The sagely Lord, the Dharma King,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 108
				-
					-
						Then comforted the limitless multitude:
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 109
				-
					-
						"After my passage into extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 110
				-
					-
						None of you should worry or fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 111
				-
					-
						For the Bodhisattva Virtue Treasury,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 112
				-
					-
						With respect to the non-outflow mark of reality,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 113
				-
					-
						In heart has penetrated it totally;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 114
				-
					-
						He will next become a Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 115
				-
					-
						By the name of Pure Body, and
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 116
				-
					-
						Will also save uncounted multitudes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 117
				-
					-
						That night the Buddha passed into extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 118
				-
					-
						As a flame dies once its fuel has been consumed.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 119
				-
					-
						The Sharira were divided up,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 120
				-
					-
						And limitless stupas built.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 121
				-
					-
						The Bhikshus and Bhikshunis,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 122
				-
					-
						Their number like the Gange's sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 123
				-
					-
						Redoubled their vigor in advancing
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 124
				-
					-
						In their quest for the unsurpassed path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 125
				-
					-
						The Dharma Master Wondrous Light
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 126
				-
					-
						Reverently kept the store of the Buddha's Law;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 127
				-
					-
						For eighty minor aeons, he
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 128
				-
					-
						Widely spread the Sutra of the Dharma Flower.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 129
				-
					-
						All of the eight royal sons
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 130
				-
					-
						Taught and led by Wondrous Light,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 131
				-
					-
						Became solid in the unsurpassed path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 132
				-
					-
						And met with Buddhas beyond all count.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 133
				-
					-
						Having presented them offerings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 134
				-
					-
						They accordingly practiced the Great Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 135
				-
					-
						And in succession, became Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 136
				-
					-
						Transmitting prophecies in turn.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 137
				-
					-
						The last of these, a god among gods,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 138
				-
					-
						Was a Buddha by the name of Burner of the Lamp,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 139
				-
					-
						A guiding master of all the immortals,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 140
				-
					-
						Who brought release to countless multitudes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 141
				-
					-
						The Dharma Master Wondrous Light
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 142
				-
					-
						Had a disciple at that time
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 143
				-
					-
						Whose heart harbored laxness, and who
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 144
				-
					-
						Was greedily attached to fame and gain.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 145
				-
					-
						Seeking fame and gain untiringly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 146
				-
					-
						He often visited the great clans;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 147
				-
					-
						He cast aside his recitations
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 148
				-
					-
						Nelgelcted, forgot, and failed to comprehend them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 149
				-
					-
						These, then, were the reasons why
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 150
				-
					-
						He was given the name "Seeker of Fame."
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 151
				-
					-
						Yet he also practiced many good deeds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 152
				-
					-
						Enabling him to meet uncounted Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 153
				-
					-
						And make offerings to all of them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 154
				-
					-
						Accordingly he walked the great path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 155
				-
					-
						And perfected the Six Paramitas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 156
				-
					-
						Now he meets the Shakyan Lion;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 157
				-
					-
						Later, He will become a Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 158
				-
					-
						By the name of Maitreya,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 159
				-
					-
						Who will broadly take all beings over-
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 160
				-
					-
						Their number far beyond all count.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 161
				-
					-
						After that Buddha had passed into extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 162
				-
					-
						the indolent one was you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 163
				-
					-
						And the Dharma Master Wondrous Light,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 164
				-
					-
						Was I, myself, now present here.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 165
				-
					-
						I saw the Buddha Brightness of Lamp;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 166
				-
					-
						His light and portents were like these.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 167
				-
					-
						Thus I know the present Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 168
				-
					-
						Wishes to speak The Dharma Flower Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 169
				-
					-
						The present marks are like the portents past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 170
				-
					-
						Expedient devices of the Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 171
				-
					-
						The Buddha now puts forth bright light,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 172
				-
					-
						To help reveal the real mark's meaning.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 173
				-
					-
						All of you now should understand, and
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 174
				-
					-
						With one heart, join your palms, and wait;
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 175
				-
					-
						The Buddha will let fall the Dharma rain,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 176
				-
					-
						To satisfy all those who seek the Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 177
				-
					-
						Those who seek three vehicles,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 178
				-
					-
						Should they have doubts or regrets,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 179
				-
					-
						The Buddha will remove them now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Verse 49: Line 180
				-
					-
						So that they vanish and none remain.

			Chapter 2
		-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One arose serenely from Samadhi and told
					Shariputra, "The wisdom of all the Buddhas is extremely profound and unlimited.
					The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter.
					It cannot be known by any of the Sound Hearers or Pratyeka Buddhas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? The Buddhas have, in the past, drawn near to countless
					hundreds of thousands of tens of thousands of millions of Buddhas, exhaustively
					practicing the unlimited Dharmas of the Way of those Buddhas. They are forging
					ahead with courage and vigor and their names are known everywhere.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"They have accomplished the most profound Dharma, one which has never been
					before, and speak of it according to what is appropriate, but its purport is
					difficult to understand."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, from the time I realized Buddhahood, I have, by means of various
					causes and conditions and various analogies, extensively proclaimed the verbal
					teaching. With countless expedient devices, I have guided living beings,
					leading them to separate from all attachments.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"Why is this? The Thus Come One has already perfected his expedient devices and
					his knowledge and vision.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, the knowledge and vision of the Thus Come One is vast, great,
					profound, and far-reaching. He has profoundly entered, without boundary, the
					unlimiteds, the unobstructeds, the powers, the fearlessnesses, the Dhyana
					concentrations, and the Samadhis of liberation, accomplishing all those Dharmas
					never had before."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"Shariputa, the Thus Come One is able to make various discriminations, cleverly
					speaking all Dharmas. His speech is gentle and delights the hearts of the
					multitudes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 8
			-

				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"Stop."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, there is no need to speak further. Why is this? As to that
					foremost, rare, and hard-to-understand Dharma accomplished by the Buddha-only
					the Buddhas and the Buddha can exhaust the Real Mark of all Dharmas, that is to
					say, with regard to all Dharmas: the suchness of the marks, the suchness of the
					nature, the suchness of the substance, the suchness of the power, the suchness
					of the function, the suchness of the causes, the suchness of the conditions,
					the suchness of the effects, and suchness of the retributions, and the suchness
					of the ultimate equality from beginning to end."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 11
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 1
				-
					-
						Illimitable are the heroes of the world.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 2
				-
					-
						All the gods and people in the world,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 3
				-
					-
						And all the classes of living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 4
				-
					-
						Cannot know the Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 5
				-
					-
						The Buddhas' powers, fearlessnesses,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 6
				-
					-
						Liberations and Samadhis,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 7
				-
					-
						And other Dharmas of the Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 8
				-
					-
						Can be fathomed by no one.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 9
				-
					-
						Formerly, following countless Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 10
				-
					-
						I perfectly walked all the paths
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 11
				-
					-
						Of the wonderful Dharma, subtle and deep,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 12
				-
					-
						Hard to see and hard to understand;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 13
				-
					-
						Through limitless millions of aeons.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 14
				-
					-
						I walked down all these paths.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 15
				-
					-
						In the Bodhimanda, I realized the fruit,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 16
				-
					-
						And have fully known and seen it all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 17
				-
					-
						The great effect and retribution,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 18
				-
					-
						The varous natures, marks, and meanings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 19
				-
					-
						Are such that I and the ten-direction Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 20
				-
					-
						Alone can understand these matters.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 21
				-
					-
						This Dharma can't be demonstrated,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 22
				-
					-
						The mark of language being still and extinct;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 23
				-
					-
						Of all the kinds of living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 24
				-
					-
						None there is who can understand it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 25
				-
					-
						Except the host of Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 26
				-
					-
						Firm in the power of faith.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 27
				-
					-
						The host of the Buddha's disciples
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 28
				-
					-
						Who've made offerings to the Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 29
				-
					-
						And who have exhausted all outflows,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 30
				-
					-
						And dwell in their final bodies-
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 31
				-
					-
						The strength of people such as these
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 32
				-
					-
						Also proves inadequate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 33
				-
					-
						If the world were filled
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 34
				-
					-
						With those like Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 35
				-
					-
						Who together spent their thoughts to measure it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 36
				-
					-
						They couldn't fathom the Buddha's wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 37
				-
					-
						Truly, suppose the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 38
				-
					-
						Were filled with those like Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 39
				-
					-
						And that the remaining disciples filled
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 40
				-
					-
						All the lands in the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 41
				-
					-
						And that together they spent their thoughts to measure it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 42
				-
					-
						They also could not know it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 43
				-
					-
						If Pratyeka Buddhas of sharp wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 44
				-
					-
						Without outflows, in their final bodies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 45
				-
					-
						Also filled the ten-directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 46
				-
					-
						Their number like the bamboo in the forest,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 47
				-
					-
						And if they put their minds together,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 48
				-
					-
						Wishing to think about the Buddha's real wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 49
				-
					-
						Throughout measureless millions aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 50
				-
					-
						They could not know the smallest part of it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 51
				-
					-
						Suppose newly resolved Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 52
				-
					-
						Who've made offerings to countless Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 53
				-
					-
						Who understand the principle and the purport,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 54
				-
					-
						And are well able to speak the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 55
				-
					-
						Whose numbers are like rice, hemp, bamboo, and reeds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 56
				-
					-
						Filled the ten-direction lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 57
				-
					-
						And suppose with one mind and with wondrous wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 58
				-
					-
						They were all together to think it over,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 59
				-
					-
						Throughout aeons like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 60
				-
					-
						Even they couldn't know the Buddha's wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 61
				-
					-
						Suppose that non-retreating Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 62
				-
					-
						Their number like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 63
				-
					-
						With one mind thought to seek that wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 64
				-
					-
						They also could not know of it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 65
				-
					-
						And what is more, Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 66
				-
					-
						That inconceivable, non-outflow,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 67
				-
					-
						Most profound and subtle Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 68
				-
					-
						I have perfectly obtained,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 69
				-
					-
						And I alone know its mark,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 70
				-
					-
						Along with the ten-direction Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 71
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 72
				-
					-
						The words of the Buddhas do not differ.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 73
				-
					-
						In the Dharma spoken by the Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 74
				-
					-
						You should place the power of great faith.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 75
				-
					-
						When the World Honored One's Dharma's at its end,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 76
				-
					-
						The true and real must be spoken.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 77
				-
					-
						I tell the assembly of Sound Hearers
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 78
				-
					-
						And those who seek the Conditioned Enlightened Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 79
				-
					-
						That I will lead them to cast off suffering's bond,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 80
				-
					-
						And arrive at Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 81
				-
					-
						The Buddha uses the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 82
				-
					-
						Demonstrating the teaching of Three Vehicles,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 83
				-
					-
						So that living beings, attached in many places,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 11: Line 84
				-
					-
						May be guided to escape.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 12
			-
				-
					At that time in the assembly there were Sound Hearers, Arhats with outflows
					extinguished, Ajnatakaundinya and others, twelve hundred persons, as well as
					Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and Upasikas who had brought forth the resolve
					to become Sound Hearers and Pratyeka Buddhas. They all had the following
					thought:
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"Why, now, does the World Honored One repeatedly praise the expedient devices
					saying, 'The Dharma obtained by the Buddha is so extremely profound and
					difficult to understand and the purport of his speech is so difficult to know,
					that none of the Sound Hearers or Pratyeka Buddhas can grasp it.' The Buddha
					has spoken of but one principle of liberation and we have already obtained this
					Dharma and arrived at Nirvana. Now, we do not understand his intention."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 14
			-
				-
					At that time Shariputra, knowing the doubts in the minds of the four-fold
					assembly, and himself not yet fully understanding, addressed the Buddha saying,
					"For what reason has the World Honored One repeatedly praised the foremost
					expedient devices of the Buddhas and the extremely profound and wonderful
					Dharma which is difficult to understand? From the past onwards I have never
					heard the Buddha speak in such a way. Presently, the four-fold assembly all has
					doubts. I only pray that the World Honored One will expound upon this subject:
					Why has the World Honored One repeatedly praised the Dharma which is extremely
					profound, subtle, and hard to understand?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time, Shariputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 1
				-
					-
						O, Sun of Wisdom, Great Honored Sage,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 2
				-
					-
						Long have you waited to speak this Dharma;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 3
				-
					-
						Speaking of your attainments of such
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 4
				-
					-
						Powers, fearlessnesses, and Samadhis,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 5
				-
					-
						Dhyana Samadhis and liberations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 6
				-
					-
						And other inconceivable Dharmas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 7
				-
					-
						Concerning the Dharma attained in the Bodhimanda,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 8
				-
					-
						No one is able to raise a question.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 9
				-
					-
						I find its meaning hard to fathom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 10
				-
					-
						And am also unable to ask about it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 11
				-
					-
						So you speak unasked,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 12
				-
					-
						Praising the path you have walked
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 13
				-
					-
						And that wisdom fine and subtle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 14
				-
					-
						Attained by all the Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 15
				-
					-
						All the Arhats, without outflows,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 16
				-
					-
						And those who seek Nirvana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 17
				-
					-
						Have fallen into a net of doubts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 18
				-
					-
						"Why has the Buddha said this?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 19
				-
					-
						Those who seek Condition Englitenment,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 20
				-
					-
						The Bhikshus, the Bhikshunis,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 21
				-
					-
						Gods, dragons, ghosts, and spirits,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 22
				-
					-
						Gandharvas and others,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 23
				-
					-
						Look at one another, perplexed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 24
				-
					-
						And then gaze at the Doubly Complete Honored One.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 25
				-
					-
						"What is the meaning of this matter?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 26
				-
					-
						"We pray that the Buddha will explain."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 27
				-
					-
						Of the host of Sound Hearers
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 28
				-
					-
						The Buddha has declared me foremost,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 29
				-
					-
						And yet now with my own wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 30
				-
					-
						I cannot resolve my doubts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 31
				-
					-
						Is this Dharma ultimate?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 32
				-
					-
						Or is it the path to be walked?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 33
				-
					-
						Disciples born from the Buddha's mouth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 34
				-
					-
						With joined palms wait, expectantly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 35
				-
					-
						Pray put forth the subtle sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 36
				-
					-
						For it's time to tell it as it really is.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 37
				-
					-
						The gods, dragons, spirits, and others
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 38
				-
					-
						Their numbers like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 39
				-
					-
						Bodhisattvas seeking Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 40
				-
					-
						Numbering a full eighty thousand,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 41
				-
					-
						And, from myriads of millions of lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 42
				-
					-
						Wheel-Turning Sage Kings have come,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 43
				-
					-
						With joined palms and reverent minds
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 15: Line 44
				-
					-
						All wish to hear of the perfect way.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 16
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha told Shariputra, "Stop! Stop! There is no need to speak
					further. If this matter were spoken of, the gods and humans in all the worlds
					would be frightened and led to doubt."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Shariputra again addressed the Buddha saying, "World Honored One, I only pray
					that you will speak it. I only pray that you will speak it. What is the reason?
					In this assembly are countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of
					Asankhyeyas of living beings who have, in the past, seen the Buddhas. Their
					roots are keen and their wisdom bright. Hearing what the Buddha says they will
					be able to revere and believe it."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time, Shariputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke the following
					verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						Dharma King, Supremely Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						Do but speak; pray have no worries,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						For, within the limitless multitudes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						Are those who can revere and believe it.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 19
			-
				-
					The Buddha again stopped Shariputra, "If this matter were spoken of, the gods,
					humans, and Asuras in all the worlds would be frightened and led to doubt, and
					those Bhikshus of overweening pride would fall into a bid pit."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 20
			-
				-
					The the World Honored One restated his meaning in verse, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 20: Line 1
				-
					-
						Stop, stop. It must not be spoken.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 20: Line 2
				-
					-
						My Dharma is wonderful beyond conception,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 20: Line 3
				-
					-
						And those of undue pride who heard it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 20: Line 4
				-
					-
						Surely would neighter revere or believe it.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 21
			-
				-
					At that time, Shariputra further addressed the Buddha, saying, "World Honored
					One, I only pray that you will speak it; I only pray that you will speak it.
					Presently, within this assembly are those who are my equal, hundreds of
					thousands of myriads of millions of them. Life after life they have been
					transformed by the Buddha. People such as these will surely be able to revere
					and believe you. They will gain security and great benefit within the long
					night."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 22
			-
				-
					At that time, Shariputra, wishing to restate his meaning, recited the following
					verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 1
				-
					-
						Supreme and Doubly Honored One.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 2
				-
					-
						Pray speak the foremost Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 3
				-
					-
						I, the Buddha's eldest disciple,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 4
				-
					-
						Wish you wil but speak it in detail.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 5
				-
					-
						The limitless host here assembled,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 6
				-
					-
						Can revere and believe this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 7
				-
					-
						For the Buddha has, for life after life,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 8
				-
					-
						Taught and transformed such ones as these.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 9
				-
					-
						With one mind, with palms joined,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 10
				-
					-
						We all wish to hear the Buddha speak.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 11
				-
					-
						Twelve hundred of us there are,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 12
				-
					-
						And more, seeking Buddhahood.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 13
				-
					-
						Pray, for those assembled here,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 14
				-
					-
						Speak of it in detail;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 15
				-
					-
						Having heard this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 22: Line 16
				-
					-
						Great will our rejoicing be.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 23
			-
				-
					Thereupon the World Honored One told Shariputra, "Since you have earnestly
					requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen attentively,
					think upon it well, and be mindful of it; I will explain it in detail for your
					sake."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 24
			-
				-
					As he said these words, five thousand Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and
					Upasikas in the assembly rose from their seats, made obeisance to the Buddha
					and left. What was the reason? The roots of their offenses were deep and grave
					and they were of such overweening pride that they claimed to have obtained what
					they had not yet obtained and to have certified to that to which they had not
					yet certified to. With faults such as these they could not stay. The World
					Honored One remained silent and did not restrain them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 25
			-
				-
					The Buddha then told Shariputra, "My assembly has now been cleared of its
					branches and leaves and only the trunks remain. Shariputra, it is excellent
					that those of overweening pride have left. You should now listen well and I
					shall speak it for you."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 26
			-
				-
					Shariputra said, "So be it, World Honored One. I wish joyfully to hear it."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 27
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Shariputra, "A wonderful Dharma such as this is spoken only
					occasionally by the Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones, just as the Udumbara flower
					appears but once in a great while.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 28
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, you should all believe that which the Buddha says, for his words,
					are not vain or false. Shariputra, all the Buddhas speak the Dharma in accord
					with what is appropriate, but its purport is difficult to understand. What is
					the reason? I extensively speak all Dharmas by means of countless expedient
					devices, various causes and conditions, analogies, and expressions. This Dharma
					cannot be understood through deliberation or discrimination. Only the Buddhas
					alone can know it. Why is this? All the Buddhas, the World Honored Ones, appear
					in the world only because of the causes and conditions of the one great matter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 29
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, what is meant by 'All Buddhas, World Honored Ones, appear in the
					world only because of the causes and conditions of the one great matter? The
					Buddhas, the World Honored Ones, appear in the world because they wish to lead
					living beings to open the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas and gain purity.
					They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to all living beings
					the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas. They appear in the world because they
					wish to lead living beings to awaken to the knowledge and vision of the
					Buddhas. They appear in the world because they wish to lead living beings to
					enter into the Path of the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, these are the causes and conditions of the one great matter for
					which all the Buddhas appear in the world."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 31
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Shariputra, "All the Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones, teach and
					transform only Bodhisattvas. All their actions are always for the one matter,
					and that is only to demonstrate and enlighten living beings to the Buddha's
					knowledge and vision. Ones use only the Buddha-Vehicle. There are no other
					vehicles, whether two or three. Shariputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas of
					the ten directions is thus.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 32
			-
				-
					Shariputra, the Buddhas of the past, by means of limitless, countless expedient
					devices, various causes Dharmas to living beings. These Dharmas were all for
					the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma
					from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the Wisdom of All Modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, when the Buddhas of the future shall come into the world, they
					will also by means of limitless, countless expedient devices, various causes
					and conditions, analogies and expressions, proclaim all the Dharmas to living
					beings. These Dharmas will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle.
					Hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, all these living beings will ultimately
					attain to the Wisdom of all Modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 34
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, presently, all the Buddhas, World Honored Ones, throughout the ten
					directions in limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of
					Buddhalands, greatly benefit living beings and bring them peace and happiness.
					These Buddhas also by means of limitless, countless expedient devices, various
					causes and conditions, analogies, and expressions, extensively proclaim all the
					dharmas to living beings. These Dharmas are all for the sake of the One
					Buddha-Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas,
					ultimately attain the Wisdom of All Modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 35
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, all the Buddhas only teach and transform Bodhisattvas because they
					wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's knowledge and vision, because
					they wish to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowledge and vision, and
					because they wish to lead living beings to enter the Buddha's knowledge and
					vision."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 36
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, I, now, too am also like this. Knowing that living beings have
					various desires to which their hearts are deeply attached, according to their
					basic dispositions, and by means of various causes and conditions, analogies,
					expressions, and the power of expedient devices, I speak the Dharma to them."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 37
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, this is all done so that they may attain the One Buddha Vehicle
					and the Wisdom of All Modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there are not even two
					vehicles, how much the less three. Shariputra, all Buddhas appear in the world
					of the five evil turbidites, that is, the kalpa turbidity, the affliction
					turbidity, the living beings turbidity, the view turbidity, and the life
					turbidity. So it is, Shariputra, that in the time of the confusion of the kalpa
					turbidity, living beings are heavy-laden with impurities; because they are
					stingly, greedy, envious, and jealous, they develop unwholesome roots. For this
					reason, all the Buddhas, by means of the power of expedient devices, within the
					One Buddha Vehicle, make discriminations and speak of three.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 39
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, if a disciple of mine calls himself an Arhat or Pratyeka Buddha,
					but does not hear or know of the fact that all the Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones,
					only teach and transform the Bodhisattvas, he is not a disciple of the Buddha,
					nor is he an Arhat, nor is he a Pratyeka Buddha."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 40
			-
				-
					"Furthermore, Shariputra, it should be known that those Bhikshus and Bhikshunis
					who claim to have attained Arhatship and to dwell in their final bodies before
					ultimate Nirvana, but who do not further resolve to seek
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, are people of overweening pride. Why is this? It is
					impossible that any Bhikshu who had actually attained Arhatship should not
					believe this Dharma, except in the case when the Buddha has passed into
					extinction and no Buddha is in existence. Why is this? After the Buddha has
					passed into extinction, those who accept, uphold, read, recite, and understand
					the meaning of Sutras such as this will be hard to find. If they encounter
					other Buddhas, they will then obtain thorough understanding of this Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 41
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, all of you should, with one heart, believe, understand, accept and
					uphold the speech of the Buddha, for in the words of all the Buddhas there is
					nothing vain or false. There are no other vehicles; there is only the One
					Buddha Vehicle."
				-
			-
				Chapter 2: Verse 42
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke
					verses, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 1
				-
					-
						Those Bhikshus and Bhikshunis,

						Who harbor overweening pride,

						The arrogant Upasakas,

						Upasikas who don't believe,

						In the four-fold host, such ones as these.

						Numbering five thousand strong.

						Who do not see their own mistakes,

						Deficient in morality,

						And guarding imperfections,

						The chaff wihin the multitude is gone,

						Thanks to the Buddha's awesome virtue.

				-
					-
						These people, lacking blessings and virtue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 14

						Are unworthy of receiving this Dharma.

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 15
				-
					-
						The assembly is free of branches and leaves;

						The Dharma obtained by the Buddhas,

						Is spoken for living beings

						Through the power of limitless expedients.

				-

						The toughts in living being's minds,

				-
					-
						The various pathways they have walked,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 23

						The nature of their various desires,

				-
					-
						Their karma, good or ill, from former lives,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 25
				-

						The Buddha knows them all thoroughly.

				-
					-
						I cause them to rejoice.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 29
				-

						I may speak the Sutras,

						Gathas, or past events,

				-

						Analogies or geyas,

				-
					-
						Or the upadesha texts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 35
				-
					-
						To dull-rooted ones who delight in lesser Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 36
				-
					-
						And who are greedily attached to birth and death,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 37
				-
					-
						Who, under limitless Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 38
				-
					-
						Have not walked the deep and wondrous Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 39
				-
					-
						Oppressed by scores of sufferings,

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 40
				-
					-
						For them I speak of Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 41
				-
					-
						I have established these expedients
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 42
				-
					-
						To cause them to enter the Buddha's wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 43
				-
					-
						Never did I say, "All of you

				-
					-
						Will realize the Buddha Way."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 45
				-
					-
						I did not say as much because
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 46
				-
					-
						The time to speak had not yet come.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 47
				-
					-
						The time, now, is exactly right,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 48
				-
					-
						To speak the Great Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 49
				-
					-
						The nine divisions of my Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 50
				-
					-
						Are spoken to accord with living beings;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 51
				-
					-
						Intending to lead them into the Great Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 52
				-
					-
						I therefore speak this Sutra text.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 53
				-
					-
						For the Buddha's disciples, pure in heart,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 54
				-
					-
						Who are complaint and have been faculties,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 55
				-
					-
						Who, under countless Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 56
				-
					-
						Have walked the deep and wondrous Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 57
				-
					-
						I speak the Sutra of the Great Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 58
				-
					-
						I predict that such people
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 59
				-
					-
						In the future will realize the Buddha Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 60
				-
					-
						For with profound thoughts they recollect the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 61
				-
					-
						Cultivate and uphold pure morality.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 62
				-
					-
						When they hear that they will become Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 63
				-
					-
						Great will their rejoicing be.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 64
				-
					-
						The Buddha knows their thoughts and conduct,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 65
				-
					-
						And speaks the Great Vehicle for them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 66
				-
					-
						If Sound Hearers or Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 67
				-
					-
						Hear this Dharma that I speak,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 68
				-
					-
						Be it but a single verse,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 69
				-
					-
						They will become Buddhas, without a doubt.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 70
				-
					-
						In the Buddhalands of the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 71
				-
					-
						There is only the Dharma of One Vehicle;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 72
				-
					-
						There are not two or three,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 73
				-
					-
						Except those spoken by the Buddhas as expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 74
				-
					-
						And those are but false appellations
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 75
				-
					-
						Used to induce living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 76
				-
					-
						So that he may teach them the Buddha's wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 77
				-
					-
						The Buddhas appear in the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 78
				-
					-
						Only for the sake of this One Real Matter;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 79
				-
					-
						The other two are not the truth;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 80
				-
					-
						To the end they would not use the small vehicle
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 81
				-
					-
						To rescue living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 82
				-
					-
						The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 83
				-
					-
						And in accord with the Dharmas he's gained,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 84
				-
					-
						Adorned with the power of Samadhi and wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 85
				-
					-
						He uses these to save living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 86
				-
					-
						Having certified to the supreme path, myself,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 87
				-
					-
						The Great Vehicle's Dharma of equality,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 88
				-
					-
						Were I to teach my means of the small vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 89
				-
					-
						Even a single human being,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 90
				-
					-
						I would have fallen into stingy greed;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 91
				-
					-
						But such a thing could never be.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 92
				-
					-
						Should people rely, in faith, upon the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 93
				-
					-
						The Thus Come One will not deceive them;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 94
				-
					-
						He has no thoughts of envy or greed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 95
				-
					-
						And he has cut off all the evil in the Dharmas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 96
				-
					-
						Therefore, throughout the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 97
				-
					-
						The Buddha alone has nothing to fear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 98
				-
					-
						My body adorned with marks,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 99
				-
					-
						I brilliantly illumine the world.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 100
				-
					-
						Revered by countless multitudes
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 101
				-
					-
						I speak the Seal of the Real Mark.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 102
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 103
				-
					-
						That in the past I took a vow,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 104
				-
					-
						Wishing to lead the multitudes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 105
				-
					-
						To be identifical with me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 106
				-
					-
						That vow, made long ago,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 107
				-
					-
						Now has been perfectly fulfilled,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 108
				-
					-
						For I have transformed all beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 109
				-
					-
						Leading them into the Buddha Path."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 110
				-
					-
						If, when I met with living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 111
				-
					-
						I taught them just the Buddha Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 112
				-
					-
						Those lacking wisdom would be puzzled;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 113
				-
					-
						Confused, they would not accept the teaching.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 114
				-
					-
						I know that these living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 115
				-
					-
						Have never cultivated good roots.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 116
				-
					-
						They are firmly attached to the five desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 117
				-
					-
						And, out of stupidity and love, become afflicted.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 118
				-
					-
						Because of all their desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 119
				-
					-
						They fall into the three evil paths,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 120
				-
					-
						They turn on the wheel in the six destinies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 121
				-
					-
						Suffering utter misery.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 122
				-
					-
						They take a tiny form in the womb;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 123
				-
					-
						Life after life, it continues to grow.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 124
				-
					-
						With scanty virtue and few blessings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 125
				-
					-
						They are oppressed by scores of sufferings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 126
				-
					-
						They enter the dense forest of deviant views,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 127
				-
					-
						Those of existence, non-existence, and the like.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 128
				-
					-
						They become dependent on those views-
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 129
				-
					-
						Sixty-two of them in all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 130
				-
					-
						Deeply attached to illusory Dharms,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 131
				-
					-
						They cling to them firmly and cannot let them go.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 132
				-
					-
						Arrogant, they brag of their loftiness;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 133
				-
					-
						They are flatterers, their hearts insincere.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 134
				-
					-
						Throughout ten billion aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 135
				-
					-
						They never hear the Buddha's name,

				-
					-
						Nor do they hear the proper Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 137

						Therefore, Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 139
				-
					-
						I set forth expedients for them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 140
				-
					-
						Speak of the way to suffering's end,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 141
				-
					-
						And demonstrate Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 142
				-
					-
						Although I speak of Nirvana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 143
				-
					-
						It is not true extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 144
				-
					-
						All Dharmas from their origin,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 145
				-
					-
						Are ever marked by still extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 146
				-
					-
						When the Buddha's disciples have walked the Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 147
				-
					-
						In a future age they will become Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 148
				-
					-
						I possess the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 149
				-
					-
						And demonstrate the Dharma of Three Vehicles.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 150
				-
					-
						All the World Honored Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 151
				-
					-
						Speak the Dharma of One Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 152
				-
					-
						Now all of you assembled here,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 153
				-
					-
						Should cast your doubts aside.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 154
				-
					-
						The speech of all Buddhas is the same:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 155
				-
					-
						There is only One Vehicle, not two.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 156
				-
					-
						Throughtout countless aeons in the past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 157
				-
					-
						Innumerable extinct Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 158
				-
					-
						Hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 159
				-
					-
						A number beyond all calculation,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 160
				-
					-
						World Honored Ones such as these,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 161
				-
					-
						Used various conditions, analogies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 162
				-
					-
						And the power of countless expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 163
				-
					-
						To proclaim the marks of all Dharmas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 164
				-
					-
						All of those World Honored Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 165
				-
					-
						Spoke the Dharma of One Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 166
				-
					-
						Transforming beings without limit,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 167
				-
					-
						Leading them to the Buddha Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 168
				-
					-
						Further, all Great Sagely Lords,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 169
				-
					-
						Know the deep desires in the hearts
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 170
				-
					-
						Of all the gods, humans, and other beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 171
				-
					-
						Within all the worlds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 172
				-
					-
						Using different expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 173
				-
					-
						Which help to reveal the foremost principle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 174
				-
					-
						If there are living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 175
				-
					-
						Who have met with Buddhas in the past
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 176
				-
					-
						Heard the Dharma, practiced giving,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 177
				-
					-
						Morality, patience, and vigor
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 178

						Dhyana Samadhi, wisdom, and so on,

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 180
				-
					-
						Persons such as these

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 181
				-
					-
						Have all realized the Buddha path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 182
				-
					-
						When those Buddhas have become extinct
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 183
				-
					-
						If there are those with compliant hearts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 184
				-
					-
						Beings such as these
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 185
				-
					-
						Have attained the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 186
				-
					-
						After the extinction of those Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 187
				-
					-
						Those who have made offerings to their Sharira,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 188
				-
					-
						Building millions of kinds of stupas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 189

						Made of gold, silver, or of crystal,

				-
					-
						Worked to grace the stupas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 194
				-
					-
						Or should there be those who've built temples
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 195
				-
					-
						Out of stone, chandana, or aloeswood,

				-
					-
						Have piled up earth into a Buddha-shrine,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 200
				-
					-
						Or even children who, at play,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 201
				-
					-
						Have piled up sand to make a stupa,

						Played solely as offerings.

						If people with scattered minds

						Have given but a single flower
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 246

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 252
				-
					-
						As an offering to the images,

				-
					-
						And have, themselves, realized the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 255
				-
					-
						They will rescue countless multitudes,

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 256
				-
					-
						And enter Nirvana without residue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 257

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 261

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 262

						Be it from Buddhas of the past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 263
				-

					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 264
				-
					-
						Those who have heard this Dharma,

				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 265
				-
					-
						Have realized the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 266
				-
					-
						The World Honored Ones of the future,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 267
				-
					-
						Are limitless in number;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 268
				-
					-
						All of these Thus Come Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 269
				-
					-
						Will also speak the Dharma of expedient devices.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 270
				-
					-
						All of the Thus Come Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 271
				-
					-
						By means of limitless expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 272
				-
					-
						Help all living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 273
				-
					-
						To enter the Buddha's non-outflow wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 274
				-
					-
						Of those who have heard the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 275
				-
					-
						None will fail to become Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 276
				-
					-
						All the Buddhas have made this vow
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 277
				-
					-
						"As to the Buddha Way which I have walked,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 278
				-
					-
						I wish to lead all living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 279
				-
					-
						Alike to obtain this Path."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 280
				-
					-
						And although the Buddhas of the future
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 281
				-
					-
						Will speak a hundred thousand million,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 282
				-
					-
						Countless Dharma doors,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 283
				-
					-
						They are, in fact, for the sake of the Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 284
				-
					-
						All Buddhas, Doubly Perfect Honored Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 285
				-
					-
						Know the Dharmas are eternally without a nature.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 286
				-
					-
						The Buddha seed arises from conditions;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 287
				-
					-
						Thus they speak of the One Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 288
				-
					-
						This Dharma abides in the Dharma's position,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 289
				-
					-
						Dwelling forever in worldly marks.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 290
				-
					-
						Having understood this in the Bodhimanda,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 291
				-
					-
						The Guiding Master teaches it expediently.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 292
				-
					-
						Those who receive the offerings of gods and humans,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 293
				-
					-
						The Buddhas of the present in the ten dirrections,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 294
				-
					-
						Their number like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 295
				-
					-
						Manifest within the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 296
				-
					-
						To bring peace and comfort to living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 297
				-
					-
						And also speak Dharma such as this.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 298
				-
					-
						Knowing the foremost still extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 299
				-
					-
						They use the power of expedients
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 300
				-
					-
						To demonstrate the various paths,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 301
				-
					-
						In reality, for the sake of the Buddha Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 302
				-
					-
						Knowing the conduct of living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 303
				-
					-
						The thoughts deep within their minds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 304
				-
					-
						Their habitual actions in the past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 305
				-
					-
						The nature of their desire, the power of their vigor,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 306
				-
					-
						and their faculties, keen or dull,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 307
				-
					-
						They employ various causes and conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 308
				-
					-
						Analogies and verbal expressions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 309
				-
					-
						To teach them the appropriate expedients.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 310
				-
					-
						Now I, too, am like them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 311
				-
					-
						Using various Dharma doors,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 312
				-
					-
						I proclaim the Buddha Way
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 313
				-
					-
						To bring peace and comfort to living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 314
				-
					-
						I use the power of my wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 315
				-
					-
						To know the nature of beings' desires;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 316
				-
					-
						I speak all Dharmas expediently,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 317
				-
					-
						To lead them all to happiness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 318
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 319
				-
					-
						As I regard them with my Buddha eye,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 320
				-
					-
						I see living beings in the six paths,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 321
				-
					-
						Impoverished, lacking blessings and wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 322
				-
					-
						Entering the dangerous path of birth and death,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 323
				-
					-
						Where they suffer unremittingly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 324
				-
					-
						They are deeply attached to the five desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 325
				-
					-
						Like a yak caring for its tail,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 326
				-
					-
						They smother themselves with greed and love,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 327
				-
					-
						Blind, and in darkness, seeing nothing.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 328
				-
					-
						They do not seek the mighty Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 329
				-
					-
						Or the Dharma which cuts off suffering,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 330
				-
					-
						But instead they deeply enter into deviant views;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 331
				-
					-
						With suffering, they wish to cast off suffering.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 332
				-
					-
						For the sake of these beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 333
				-
					-
						I give rise to the Great Compassion Heart.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 334
				-
					-
						When first I sat in the Bodhimanda,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 335
				-
					-
						In contemplation, or walking about the tree,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 336
				-
					-
						For a full three times seven days,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 337
				-
					-
						I thought over matters such as these:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 338
				-
					-
						The wisdom which I have obtained,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 339
				-
					-
						Is subtle, wonderful, and foremost,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 340
				-
					-
						But living beings are dull-rooted,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 341
				-
					-
						Attached to pleasure, blinded by delusion;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 342
				-
					-
						Beings such as these,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 343
				-
					-
						How can they possibly be saved?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 344
				-
					-
						Just then the Brahma Heaven Kings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 345
				-
					-
						As well as the God Shakra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 346
				-
					-
						The Four World-Protecting God Kings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 347
				-
					-
						The god of the heaven of Great Comfort,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 348
				-
					-
						And the other heavenly multitudes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 349
				-
					-
						With retinues numbering in the billions
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 350
				-
					-
						Reverently placed their palms togehter,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 351
				-
					-
						And requested me to turn the Dharma Wheel.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 352
				-
					-
						I then thought to myself,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 353
				-
					-
						"Were I to praise only the Buddha Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 354
				-
					-
						Beings sunk in suffering
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 355
				-
					-
						Would be unable to believe this Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 356
				-
					-
						They would slander it out of disbelief,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 357
				-
					-
						And fall into the three evil paths.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 358
				-
					-
						It's better that I do not speak the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 359
				-
					-
						But quickly enter into Nirvana."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 360
				-
					-
						Then I recalled that the Buddhas of the past
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 361
				-
					-
						Practiced powerful expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 362
				-
					-
						And as I now have obtained the Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 363
				-
					-
						When I had been thinking thus,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 364
				-
					-
						The Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 365
				-
					-
						And with the Brahma sound encouraged me, saying,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 366
				-
					-
						"Good indeed, O Shakyamuni,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 367
				-
					-
						Foremost Guiding Master.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 368
				-
					-
						Having attained the supreme Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 369
				-
					-
						You follow the precedent of all Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 370
				-
					-
						To employ the power of expedient devices.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 371
				-
					-
						We have all obtained as well,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 372
				-
					-
						That foremost Dharma, most wonderful.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 373
				-
					-
						For the various kinds of living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 374
				-
					-
						We discriminate and teach Three Vehicles.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 375
				-
					-
						Those of little wisdom who delight in lesser Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 376
				-
					-
						Would not believe that they could become Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 377
				-
					-
						That is why we use expedient means,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 378
				-
					-
						To discriminate and teach the various fruits.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 379
				-
					-
						Although Three Vehciles are taught.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 380
				-
					-
						It is only for the sake of teaching Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 381
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 382
				-
					-
						That when I heard the Sagely Lions'
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 383
				-
					-
						Deep, pure, and wondrous sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 384
				-
					-
						I called out "Homage to all Buddhas."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 385
				-
					-
						And further had this thought,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 386
				-
					-
						"I have come into a turbid, evil world;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 387
				-
					-
						As the Buddhas speak,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 388
				-
					-
						I should follow in accord."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 389
				-
					-
						Having thought upon this matter,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 390
				-
					-
						I went straightway to Varanasi.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 391
				-
					-
						Since the still and extinct mark of all Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 392
				-
					-
						Cannot be expressed in words,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 393
				-
					-
						I used the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 394
				-
					-
						To instruct the five Bhikshus.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 395
				-
					-
						This was called the turning of the Dharma wheel.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 396
				-
					-
						Then came the sound of Nirvana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 397
				-
					-
						As well as "Arhatship,"
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 398
				-
					-
						"Dharma," and the "Sangha," various names.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 399
				-
					-
						From remote aeons onward,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 400
				-
					-
						I have praised and shown Nirvana's Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 401
				-
					-
						As the final end of birth and death's sufferings;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 402
				-
					-
						Always have I spoken thus.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 403
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 404
				-
					-
						I see disciples of the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 405
				-
					-
						Resolutely seeking the Buddha Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 406
				-
					-
						Limitless thousands of myriads of millions of them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 407
				-
					-
						All with hearts of reverence,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 408
				-
					-
						All coming before the Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 409
				-
					-
						They had heard, from former Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 410
				-
					-
						Expedient teachings of the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 411
				-
					-
						This causes me to think,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 412
				-
					-
						"The reason why the Thus Come One appears,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 413
				-
					-
						Is to teach the wisdom of the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 414
				-
					-
						And now the time is exactly right."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 415
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 416
				-
					-
						Those with dull faculties and slight wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 417
				-
					-
						Those attached to marks, the arrogant,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 418
				-
					-
						Cannot believe this Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 419
				-
					-
						I now rejoice and have no fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 420
				-
					-
						And among the Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 421
				-
					-
						I shall cast expedients aside,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 422
				-
					-
						To speak only of the supreme Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 423
				-
					-
						When the Bodhisattvas have heard this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 424
				-
					-
						The network of their doubts will be rent;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 425
				-
					-
						Twelve hundred Arhats
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 426
				-
					-
						Will all attain to Buddhahood.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 427
				-
					-
						As the Buddhas of the three periods of time
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 428
				-
					-
						In such a manner spoke the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 429
				-
					-
						So do I likewise now expound
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 430
				-
					-
						The undiscriminated Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 431
				-
					-
						All Buddhas come into the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 432
				-
					-
						But rarely, and are hard to meet;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 433
				-
					-
						And when they appear in the world,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 434
				-
					-
						It's hard for them to speak the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 435
				-
					-
						Throughtout countless ages, too,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 436
				-
					-
						It's difficult to hear this Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 437
				-
					-
						And those who can hear this Dharma-
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 438
				-
					-
						Such people too, are rare,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 439
				-
					-
						Like the udumbara flower,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 440
				-
					-
						In which all take delight,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 441
				-
					-
						Which the gods and humans prize,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 442
				-
					-
						For it blooms but once in a long, long time.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 443
				-
					-
						So one who hears this Dharma, gives joyful praise,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 444
				-
					-
						With even just a single word,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 445
				-
					-
						Has thereby made offerings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 446
				-
					-
						To all the Buddhas of the three periods of time.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 447
				-
					-
						Such people are extremely rare.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 448
				-
					-
						Rarer than the udumbara flower.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 449
				-
					-
						All of you should have no doubts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 450
				-
					-
						For I am the Dharma King;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 451
				-
					-
						I declare to the assembly:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 452
				-
					-
						I use only the path of One Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 453
				-
					-
						To teach and transform Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 454
				-
					-
						There are no Sound Hearer Disciples.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 455
				-
					-
						Shariputra, all of you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 456
				-
					-
						the Sound Hearers and Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 457
				-
					-
						Should know that this wondrous Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 458
				-
					-
						Is the secret essence of all Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 459
				-
					-
						In the evil world of five turbidities,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 460
				-
					-
						Beings who are blissfully attached
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 461
				-
					-
						To pleasures and desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 462
				-
					-
						Wil never seek the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 463
				-
					-
						Evil people of the future,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 464
				-
					-
						Hearing the Buddha speak of One Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 465
				-
					-
						In their delusion will not accept or believe it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 466
				-
					-
						But will slander it and fall into the evil paths.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 467
				-
					-
						Still, those with shame and purity,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 468
				-
					-
						Who resolutely seek the Buddha Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 469
				-
					-
						For such ones as these I praise
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 470
				-
					-
						The path of One Vehicle, extensively.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 471
				-
					-
						Shariputra, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 472
				-
					-
						The Dharma of all Buddhas is like this:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 473
				-
					-
						By means of millions of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 474
				-
					-
						I speak Dharma in accord with what's appropriate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 475
				-
					-
						But those who do not study it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 476
				-
					-
						Will never come to understand it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 477
				-
					-
						Since all of you already know
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 478
				-
					-
						All Buddhas, Masters of the World,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 479
				-
					-
						Work by means of appropriate expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 480
				-
					-
						You should have no further doubts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 481
				-
					-
						Let your hearts be filled with joy;
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Verse 42: Line 482
				-
					-
						You know you will reach Buddhahood.
					-
		-
			Chapter 3
		-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Thereupon, Shariputra, with joyful enthusiasm, rose, joined his palms together,
					and gazed reverently at the honored one's face and said to the Buddha, "Now,
					having heard this sound of Dharma from the World Honored One, my heart rejocies
					and I have obtained what I never had before."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? In the past, I heard a Dharma such as this from the
					Buddha, and saw the Bodhisattvas receive predictions of Buddhahood, but we had
					no part in this matter. I was deeply hurt that I had lost the limitless
					knowledge and vision of the Thus Come One.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, when I used to dwell alone in mountain forests at the foot
					of trees, whether sitting or walking I continually had this thought: 'We all
					identically enter into the Dharma nature. Why has The Thus Come One shown us
					deliverance by means of the Small Vehicle Dharma? It is our fault, not the
					World Honored One's.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? If we had waited for the lecture on the cause of realizing
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, we should certainly have been delivered by means of the
					Great Vehicle. But we did not understand that expedient devices were spoken in
					accord with what was appropriate. Therefore, when we first heard the
					BuddhaDharma, upon encountering it we immediately believed and accepted it,
					considered it, and took certification.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, from of old I have, day and night, continually reproached
					myself. Now, from the Buddha, I have heard what I never heard before, this
					Dharma which has never been before, and all my doubts have been severed. My
					body and mind are blissfull and I am at peace.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Today, indeed, I know that I am a true disciple of the Buddha, born from the
					Buddha's mouth, transformed from the Dharma; I have obtained a share of the
					Buddhadharma."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 7
			-
				-
					At that time Shariputra, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 1
				-
					-
						Hearing this Dharma sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 2
				-
					-
						I gain what I never had;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 3
				-
					-
						My heart is filled with great joy,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 4
				-
					-
						The net of doubts has been cast aside.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 5
				-
					-
						From the old, favored with the Buddha's teaching,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 6
				-
					-
						I had never lost the greater vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 7
				-
					-
						The Buddha's sound is extremely rare,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 8
				-
					-
						And can rid beings of their woes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 9
				-
					-
						I've already attained to the end of outflows,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 10
				-
					-
						Yet hearing it my woes also are dispelled.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 11
				-
					-
						As I dwelt in the mountain valleys,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 12
				-
					-
						Sometimes at the foot of trees,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 13
				-
					-
						Whether sitting or walking,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 14
				-
					-
						I constantly thought upon this topic:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 15
				-
					-
						"Ah," I cried in bitter self-reproach,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 16
				-
					-
						"Why have I deceived myself?
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 17
				-
					-
						We, too, are the Buddha's disciples,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 18
				-
					-
						And equally enter the non-outflow Dharma;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 19
				-
					-
						Yet in the future we shall not be able
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 20
				-
					-
						To proclaim the unsurpassed path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 21
				-
					-
						The golden color, the Thirty-Two,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 22
				-
					-
						The Ten Powers and all the liberations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 23
				-
					-
						Are together in a single Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 24
				-
					-
						But I have not obtained these things.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 25
				-
					-
						The Eighty Wondrous Excellences,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 26
				-
					-
						The EighteenUnshared Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 27
				-
					-
						Such qualities of virtue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 28
				-
					-
						I have missed them, every one.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 29
				-
					-
						When I used to walk alone
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 30
				-
					-
						I would see the Buddha in the Great Assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 31
				-
					-
						His fame filling the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 32
				-
					-
						Vastly benefitting all beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 33
				-
					-
						I felt I'd lost this benefit,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 34
				-
					-
						And had but cheated myself.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 35
				-
					-
						Constantly, both day and night,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 36
				-
					-
						I thought upon this matter,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 37
				-
					-
						And wished to ask the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 38
				-
					-
						Whether or not I had lost it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 39
				-
					-
						I often saw the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 40
				-
					-
						Praising all the Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 41
				-
					-
						And so it was, by day and night,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 42
				-
					-
						I pondered on matters such as these.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 43
				-
					-
						Now I hear the Buddha's sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 44
				-
					-
						Opportunely speaking that Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 45
				-
					-
						Which is without outflows-
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 46
				-
					-
						Hard to conceive of-
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 47
				-
					-
						And leads living beings to the Bodhimanda.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 48
				-
					-
						Once I was attached to deviant views,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 49
				-
					-
						And was a teacher of the Brahmins.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 50
				-
					-
						The World Honored One knew my heart,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 51
				-
					-
						Pulled out the deviant, taught me Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 52
				-
					-
						I rid myself of deviant views,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 53
				-
					-
						Certified to the Dharma of emptiness,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 54
				-
					-
						Then I said to myself
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 55
				-
					-
						That I'd arrived at extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 56
				-
					-
						But now at last I realize
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 57
				-
					-
						It is not real extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 58
				-
					-
						For when I become a Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 59
				-
					-
						Complete with Thirty-two Marks,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 60
				-
					-
						Revered by gods, humans, and Yaksha Hordes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 61
				-
					-
						Dragons, spirits, and others,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 62
				-
					-
						Only then will I be able to say,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 63
				-
					-
						"This is eternal extinction, without residue."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 64
				-
					-
						The Buddha, in the Great Assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 65
				-
					-
						Has said I shall become a Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 66
				-
					-
						Hearing such a Dharma sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 67
				-
					-
						All my doubts have been dispelled.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 68
				-
					-
						When I first heard the Buddha speak,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 69
				-
					-
						My heart was filled with great fear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 70
				-
					-
						Is this not Mara disquised as the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 71
				-
					-
						Come to disturb and confuse my heart?
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 72
				-
					-
						The Buddha, by means of various conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 73
				-
					-
						Analogies, and ingenious speech,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 74
				-
					-
						Makes one's heart calm as the sea.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 75
				-
					-
						Hearing him the net of my doubts was rent.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 76
				-
					-
						The Buddha says that in the past
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 77
				-
					-
						The limitless Buddhas, now extinct,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 78
				-
					-
						Dwelt calmly in expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 79
				-
					-
						And also spoke this Dharma-each of them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 80
				-
					-
						The Buddhas of the present and the future,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 81
				-
					-
						Their numbers without limit,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 82
				-
					-
						Also used expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 83
				-
					-
						To proclaim the Dharma such as this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 84
				-
					-
						Just as now the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 85
				-
					-
						From birth until his leaving home,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 86
				-
					-
						His attaining the Way and turning the Dharma Wheel,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 87
				-
					-
						Also spoke by means of expedients.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 88
				-
					-
						The World Honored One speaks the real path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 89
				-
					-
						The evil one does no such thing;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 90
				-
					-
						Hence I now for certain
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 91
				-
					-
						This is not the demon posing as a Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 92
				-
					-
						Because I had fallen into a net of doubts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 93
				-
					-
						I said it was the doings of a demon.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 94
				-
					-
						Hearing the Buddha's complaint voice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 95
				-
					-
						Profound, far-reaching, subtle and fine,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 96
				-
					-
						Proclaiming wide the clear, pure Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 97
				-
					-
						Great is the joy within my heart.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 98
				-
					-
						My doubts are forever ended,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 99
				-
					-
						As in real wisdom I stand firm.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 100
				-
					-
						I am certain to become a Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 101
				-
					-
						Revered by gods and humans.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 102
				-
					-
						I shall turn the unsurpassed wheel of Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 7: Line 103
				-
					-
						To teach and transform the Bodhisattvas.
					-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 8
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha told Shariputra, "I, now, amidst the great assembly of
					gods, humans, Shramanas, Brahmins, and others, declare that in the distant
					past, in the presence of twenty thousand millions of Buddhas, for the sake of
					the unsurpassed path, I have constantly taught and transformed you. And you,
					throughout the long night, have followed me and received my instruction. I have
					used expedient devices to guide you to be born within my Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, in the past I taught you to resolve yourself on the Buddha path,
					but you have completely forgotten this, and so you say of yourself that you
					have already attained extinction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"Now, again, wishing you to recall the path you have practiced according to
					your past vows, I, for the sake of the Sound Hearers, speak this Great Vehicle
					Sutra by the name of The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, a Dharma for
					instructing Bodhisattvas of whom the Buddhas are protective and mindful.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, in a future age, after limitless, boundless, inconceivable aeons,
					having made offerings to some thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas,
					having reverently upheld the proper Dharma, and having perfected the path
					practiced by the Bodhisattvas, you shall become a Buddha by the name of
					Flower-Light Thus Come One, One Worthy of Offerings, of Proper and Universal
					Knowledge, One Whose Understanding and Conduct Are Complete, a Well-gone One
					Who Understands the World, an Unsurpassed Lord, a Taming and Regulating Hero, a
					Buddha, a World Honored One.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"His country shall be called 'Apart From Filth.' Its ground will be level,
					pure, and adorned, tranquil and prosperous, and abounding with gods. It shall
					have lapis lazuli for soil and eight intersecting roads bordered with golden
					cords and by which shall stand rows of trees made of the seven jewels
					constantly blooming and bearing fruit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"The Thus Come One Flower Light will also teach and transform living beings by
					means of the Three Vehicles. Shariputra, when this Buddha comes into the world,
					although it will not be an evil age, because of his past vows, he shall teach
					the Dharma of the Three Vehicles.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"That aeon will be called 'Adorned with Great Jewels.' Why will it be called
					'Adhorned with Great Jewels?' Because in that land, Bodhisattvas will be
					considered Great Jewels."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"These Bodhisattvas will be limitless, boundless, inconceivable in number,
					beyond the reach of calculation or analogy. With the exception of the power of
					the Buddha's wisdom, no one shall be able to know their number.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"When they wish to walk, jeweled flowers will spring up beneath their feet.
					These Bodhisattvas will not be those who have just brought forth their
					thoughts. They will have planted the roots of virtue for a long time, and in
					the presence of limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of Buddhas purely
					cultivated Brahman conduct, constantly receiving the Buddha's praise.
					Constantly cultivating the Buddha's wisdom and complete with great spiritual
					penetrations, they will be well-versed in all the doors of Dharma,
					straight-forward, ingenuous, and strong-willed, Bodhisattvas such as these will
					fill that country.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, the lifespan of the Buddha Flower Light will be twelve small
					aeons, not counting the time during which, as a prince, he will not yet have
					become a Buddha. The lifespan of the people in that country will be eight small
					aeons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"After twelve small aeons, the Thus Come One Flower Light will confer upon the
					Bodhisattva Solid Fullness a prediction of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, and announce
					to the Bhikshus, 'The Bodhisattva Solid Fullness shall next become a Buddha by
					the name of Flowery Feet Peacefully Walking, Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha.
					His Buddha country will be of like character."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, when the Buddha Flower Light has passed into extinction, the

				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 20

					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses saying,

				-
					-
						Shariputra, in a future age,

				Chapter 3: Verse 22
			-
				-
					Each removed his upper garment and presented it as an offering to the Buddha.
					Shakro Devanam Indrah and the Brahma Heaven king, together with countless gods,

					Mandarava flowers and Mahamandarava flowers, and so forth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 23
			-
				-
					The heavenly garments they tossed aloft remained in empty space and whirled

				-
					At that time all the gods, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses

				-
					-
						Long ago in Varanashi,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 25: Line 2

						You turned the Dharma Wheel of Four Noble Truths,

				-
					-
						Discriminatingly speaking of the Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 25: Line 4

					At that time, Shariputra spoke to the Buddha saying, "World Honored One, I now
					have no further doubts or regrets, having received from the Buddha a prediction
					for Anuttarasamyaksambodh. But the twelve hundred whose hearts have attained
					self-mastery, and who formerly dwelt in the stage of study, were constantly
					taught by the Buddha who said, 'My Dharma can enable one to separate from
					birth, old age, sickness, and death and attain ultimate Nirvana.' Both those
					who study and those beyond study alike have separated from the view of a self,
					the views of existence and non-existence, and so forth, and claim that they
					have attained Nirvana. Yet now, hearing from the World Honored One that which
					they have never heard before, they have all fallen into doubt and delusion.
					Good indeed, World Honored One, I beg that you would, for the sake of the
					four-fold assembly, speak of these causes and conditions, to free them of their
					doubts and regrets."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 27
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha told Shariputra, "have I not said before that all the
					Buddhas, World Honored Ones, speak the Dharma by means of various causes and
					conditions, parables, and phrases, and expedient devices, all for the sake of
					Anuttarasamyaksambodh? All of these teachings are for the sake of transforming
					the Bodhisattvas. However, Shariputra, I shall now again make use of a parable
					in order to further clarify the principle, for all those who are wise gain
					understanding through parables.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 28
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, suppose that in a country, a city, or a village, there is a great
					elder, aged and worn, of limitless wealth, possessing many fields, houses, and
					servants.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 29
			-
				-
					"His house is spacious and large, having only one door, but with a great many
					people-one hundred, two hundred, even five hundred of them-dwelling within it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"Its halls and chambers are decaying and old; its walls are crumbling. The
					pillars are rotting at their baes; the beams and ridge-poles are toppling
					dangerously.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 31
			-
				-
					"All at once, throughout the house, a fire breaks out, setting the house
					ablaze.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"The elder's sons, ten, twenty, even thirty of them are inside the house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"The elder, seeing the fire arise from the four sides, is greatly alarmed and
					makes the following reflection: 'Although I have been able to escape safely
					through this burning doorway, all my children remain inside the burning house,
					happily attached to their amusements, unaware, unknowing, not alarmed and not
					afraid. The fire presses upon them and the pain will sear them, but at heart
					they do not mind it, nor have they any thought to escape.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 34
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, the elder then reflects, 'I have a strong body and arms. I might
					gather them in a cloth pouch or on a table and take them from the house.' He
					further reflects, 'This house has only one door and it is narrow and small. My
					sons are young and immature and as yet know nothing. Attached to their place of
					play, they may fall and be burnt in the fire. I must tell them of this
					frightful matter, that the house has caught fire, and they must hurry and come
					out so as not to be burned.' So thinking, he speaks to his sons, saying, 'Come
					out, all of you, quickly!' Although the father, in his pity, induces them with
					good words, still all the sons are happily attached to their amusements and
					play and refuse to believe him. They are not frightend or afraid and have not
					the slightest intention of leaving. What is more, they don't know what is meant
					by 'fire,' what is meant by 'house' or what is meant by 'being lost.' They
					merely run from east to west in play, staring at their father.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 35
			-
				-
					"Then the elder has this thought, 'The house is already ablaze with a great
					fire. If my sons and I do not get out in time we certainly shall be burned. I
					shall now devise an expedient device so that my sons can avoid this disaster.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 36
			-
				-
					"The father, knowing both the predispositions of his sons and the preferences
					each has for various precious toys and unusual playthings to which they happily
					responded, speaks to them saying, 'The things you will love to play with are
					rare and hard to get. If you do not take them you will certainly regret it
					later. Things such as these: a variety of sheep carts, deer carts, and ox
					carts, are now outside the door for you to play with. All of you should quickly
					come out of this burning house and I shall give you whatever you want.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 37
			-
				-
					"Then the children, hearing their father speak of these precious playthings
					which suited their wishes exactly, eagerly push and shove one another aside in
					a mad scramble, all fighting to get out of the burning house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"At that time, the elder, seeing that all his sons have gotten out safely and
					are seated on the ground at the crossroads, is without further obstruction; his
					mind is at peace and he is filled with joy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 39
			-
				-
					"Then the children all speak to their father saying, 'Father, the fine
					playthings you promised us a while ago, the sheep carts, the deer carts, and
					the ox carts, please give them to us now.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 40
			-
				-
					"O Shariputra, at that time the elder gives to all of his sons equally a great
					cart.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 41
			-
				-
					"The cart is high and wide, adorned with a multitude of intertwining jewels,
					surrounded by railings, and hung with bells on its four sides. Further, it is
					covered with canopies, adorned with various rare and precious jewels, strung
					with jeweled cords and hung with flowered tassels. The cart is heaped with
					beautiful mats and set about with rosy cushions. It is yoked to an ox, plump
					and white and of fine appearance, of great muscular strength, who walks with
					even tread, as fleet as the wind, having also many servants who follow and
					guard it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 42
			-
				-
					"And why is this? That great elder has limitless wealth and all manner of
					storehouses full to overflowing.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 43
			-
				-
					"So he reflects thus: 'My possessions are boundless. I should not give my
					children small or inferior carts. All of these younsters are my children whom I
					love without partiality. Having such great carts made of the seven jewels,
					infinite in number, I should give them to each one equally. Why? If I gave them
					to an entire country, they would not run short; how much the less if I gave
					them to my children!
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 44
			-
				-
					"Meanwhile, all of the children are riding around on the great carts, having
					got what they never expected to have, beyond their original hopes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 45
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, what do you think? When that elder gives equally to all of his
					children the great jeweled carriages, is the guilty of falsehood or not?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 46
			-
				-
					Shariputra replied, "No, World Honored One. The elder is not guilty of
					falsehood, for he has only enabled his children to avoid the calmity of fire,
					and has thereby saved their lives. Why is this? In saving their lives he has
					already given them a fine plaything. How much the more so his setting up of
					expedients to save them from the burning house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 47
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, if that elder had not given them even so much as a single
					small cart, he still would not have been speaking falsely. Why? Because the
					elder previously had this thought, 'I shall use expedients to lead my children
					out.' For this reason he is not guilty of falsehood. He is even less guilty
					since, knowing his own wealth to be limitless and wishing to benefit all his
					children, he gives to them equally a great cart."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 48
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Shariputra, "Good indeed, good indeed! It is just as you say.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 49
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, the Thus Come One is also like this in that he is a father to all
					in the world. He has forever ended all fear, weakness, worry, ignorance and
					obscurity. He has completely realized the limitless knowledge and vision,
					powers, and fearlessnesses. He has great spiritual might and the power of
					wisdom. He has perfected the Paramitas of Expedients and wisdom. He is greatly
					kind and compassionate. Never tiring, he ever seeks the good, benefitting all.
					And thus he is born in the Three Realms which are like a burning house. In
					order to save living beings from the fires of birth, old age, sickness, death,
					grief, misery, stupidity, dullness, and the Three Poisons. He teaches and
					transforms them, leading them to the attainment of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 50
			-
				-
					"He sees all living beings are scorched by birth, old age, sickness, death,
					grief, and misery. They undergo various sufferings because of the Five Desires,
					wealth and profit. Further, because of their clinging and grasping, they
					presently undergo a mass of suffering and in the future will undergo suffering
					in the hells, among the animals, or hungry ghosts. If born in the heavens or
					among human beings, they will suffer poverty and distress, the suffering of
					being separated from what one loves, the suffering of being joined together
					with what one hates, and all the various sufferings such as these. However,
					living beings sunk in this morass, joyfully sport, unaware, unknowing,
					unalarmed and unafraid. They do not grow satiated nor do they seek liberation.
					In the burning house of the Three Realms they run about from east to west.
					Although they encounter tremendous suffering, they are not concerned.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 51
			-
				-
					"Shariuputra, having seen this, the Buddha further thinks, 'I am the father of
					living beings. I should rescue them from this suffering and difficulty, and
					give them the limitless, boundless joy of the Buddha-wisdom to play with.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 52
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, the Thus Come One further thinks, 'If I merely use spiritual power
					and the power of wisdom, and cast aside expedients, praising for all living
					beings the power of the Thus Come One's knowledge and vision, powers, and
					fearlessnesses, living beings will not be able to be saved in this way. Why is
					this? All of these living beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness,
					death, grief and misery. They are being scorched in the burning house of the
					Three Realms. How could they understand the wisdom of the Buddha?'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 53
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, just as that elder, although he had a powerful body and arms, did
					not use them, but merely applied expedients with diligence to save all the
					children from disaster in the burning house, and afterwards gave to each of
					them a great cart adorned with precious jewels. In the same way, the Thus Come
					One, although he has powers and fearlessnesses, doe not use them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 54
			-
				-
					"He merely uses wisdom and expedients to rescue living beings from the burning
					house of the Three Realms, speaking to them of Three Vehicles; that of Sound
					Hearer, Pratyeka Buddha, and Buddha Vehicle."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 55
			-
				-
					"And he says to them, ' All of you should take no pleasure in dwelling in the
					burning house of the Three Realms. Do not lust after vulgar and evil forms,
					sounds, smells, tastes and tangible objects. If you attach to them greedily and
					give rise to love for them you will be burnt. You should quickly escape the
					Three Realms and obtain the Three Vehicles; the Sound Hearer, Pratyeka Buddha,
					and Buddha Vehicles. I now give my pledge for this and it shall never be proved
					false. You need only diligently and vigorously cultivate. The Thus Come One
					using these expedient means leads all creatures.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 56
			-
				-
					"He further says, 'You should all know that the Dharmas of the Three Vehicles
					have been praised by the sages. They will make you free, unbound, and
					self-reliant. Riding on these Three Vehicles, by means of non-outflow roots,
					powers, enlightenments, ways, Dhyanas, concentrations, liberations, Samadhis,
					and so on, you shall amuse yourselves and attain limitless peace and joy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 57
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, if there are living beings who inwardly possess the wisdom-nature,
					and hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World Honored One, believed and
					accepted it, diligently making progress, wishing quickly to escape the Three
					Realms and seeking Nirvana for themselves. They are called those of the Sound
					Hearer Vehicle. They are like the children who sought the sheep cart and
					thereby escaped from the burning house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 58
			-
				-
					"If there are living beings who hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World
					Honored One, believed and accepted it, diligently making progress, and who seek
					for themselves spontaneous wisdom, delighting in solitude and fond of
					stillness, deeply understanding the causal conditions of all Dharmas, they are
					called those of the Pratyeka Buddha Vehicle. They are like the children who
					sought the deer cart and so escaped the burning house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 59
			-
				-
					"If there are living beings who hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World
					Honored One, believed and accepted it, earnestly cultivating with vigor,
					seeking all-wisdom, untutored wisdom, the knowledge and vision fo the Thus Come
					One, his powers and fearlessnesses, pitying and comforting limitless living
					beings, benefitting gods and humans, saving all, they are called those of the
					Great Vehicle. Because the Bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, they are called
					Mahasattvas. They are like the children who sought the ox cart and so escaped
					the burning house.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 60
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, just as that elder, seeing all his children safely escape the
					burning house to a place of fearlessness, and considering his own unlimited
					wealth, gives to all of his children a great cart. Just so the Thus Come One,
					in the same way is the father of all living beings. When he sees limitless
					millions of living beings using the gateway of the Buddha's teaching to get off
					the fearsome and dangerous path of the suffering of the Three Realms and attain
					the bliss of Nirvana, he has this thought, 'I have limitless, boundless wisdom,
					powers, fearlessnesses and so on - the complete storehouse of the
					Buddhadharmas. All of these living beings are my children. I should give to all
					of them a great cart, not allowing them to gain individual extinction, but
					crossing them over to extinction by means of the Thus Come One's extinction.
					Having escaped the Three Realms, all these living beings are given as
					playthings the Buddha's Dhyana concentrations, liberations, and so forth, all
					of one mark and one kind, praised by the sages and productive of pure,
					wondrous, and foremost bliss.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 61
			-
				-
					"Shariputra, just as that elder first having used the three carts to entice his
					children and then later having giventhem a great cart adorned with jewels and
					supremely comfortable, is not guilty of falsehood. Just so is the Thus Come One
					likewise not guilty of falsehoold in first speaking of the Three Vehicles to
					entice living beings and then afterwards delivering them only by means of Great
					Vehicle. What is the reason? The Thus Come One has limitless wisdom, powers and
					fearlessnesses, a storehouse of Dharmas, and is able to give to all living
					beings the Great Vehicle Dharma. Not all living beings, however, are able to
					accept it. Shariputra, because of these causes and conditions you should know
					that the Buddhas, using the power of expedient devices, in the One Buddha
					Vehicle, discriminate and speak of three."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3: Verse 62
			-
				-
					The Buddha, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke verses, saying:

					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 69
				-
					-
						Howling in search of food.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 70
				-
					-
						Further there were ghosts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 71
				-
					-
						With throats like needles.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 72
				-
					-
						Again there were ghosts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 73
				-
					-
						With heads like oxen,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 74
				-
					-
						Now eating human flesh,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 75
				-
					-
						And then devouring dogs.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 76
				-
					-
						Their hair was dishevelled
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 77
				-
					-
						They were harmful, cruel and dangerous,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 78
				-
					-
						Oppressed by hunger and thirst,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 79
				-
					-
						They ran about shouting and crying out.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 80
				-
					-
						There were Yakshas, hungry ghosts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 81
				-
					-
						And all sorts of evil birds and beasts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 82
				-
					-
						Frantic with hunger, facing the four directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 83
				-
					-
						Peeking out the windows.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 84
				-
					-
						Such were the troubles
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 85
				-
					-
						And terrors beyond measure there.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 86
				-
					-
						This old, decaying house
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 87
				-
					-
						Belonged to a man
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 88
				-
					-
						Who had gone but a short distance
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 89
				-
					-
						When, before very long,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 90
				-
					-
						The rear rooms of the house
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 91
				-
					-
						Suddenly caught fire.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 92
				-
					-
						All at one, all four sides
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 93
				-
					-
						Were enveloped by raging flames.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 94
				-
					-
						The beams, ridgepoles, rafters, and pillars
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 95
				-
					-
						Shook and split with the sound of explosion,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 96
				-
					-
						Snapped apart and fell,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 97
				-
					-
						As the walls and partitions collapses and fell in.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 98
				-
					-
						All the ghosts and spirits
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 99
				-
					-
						Screamed loudly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 100
				-
					-
						While the hawks, vultures, and other birds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 101
				-
					-
						The Kumbhandas, and so forth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 102
				-
					-
						Ran about in a panic,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 103
				-
					-
						Unable to get themselves out.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 104
				-
					-
						Evil beasts and poisonous insects
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 105
				-
					-
						Hid away in the holes and crevices,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 106
				-
					-
						While the Pishacha ghosts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 107
				-
					-
						Also dwelt therein.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 108
				-
					-
						Their blessings and virtue scanty,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 109
				-
					-
						They were hard pressed by the fire;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 110
				-
					-
						They wrought harm on one another,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 111
				-
					-
						Drinking blood and eating flesh.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 112
				-
					-
						As the packs of Yeh Kan
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 113
				-
					-
						Were already dead,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 114
				-
					-
						Monstrous evil beasts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 115
				-
					-
						Raced to devour them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 116
				-
					-
						While billows of stinking smoke
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 117
				-
					-
						Permeated all four sides.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 118
				-
					-
						Centipedes and millipedes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 119
				-
					-
						And various kinds of poisonous snakes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 120
				-
					-
						Burnt by the fire,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 121
				-
					-
						Fought to escape their holes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 122
				-
					-
						Kumbhanda ghosts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 123
				-
					-
						Grabbed and ate them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 124
				-
					-
						Further, all the hungry ghosts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 125
				-
					-
						The tops of their heads aflame,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 126
				-
					-
						Tormented by hunger, thirst, and heat,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 127
				-
					-
						Ran about in terror and distress.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 128
				-
					-
						So it was in that house:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 129
				-
					-
						Terrifying to the extreme,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 130
				-
					-
						With dangers and conflagrations-
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 131
				-
					-
						A host of troubles, not just one.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 132
				-
					-
						At that time the owner of the house
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 133
				-
					-
						Was standing outside the door
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 134
				-
					-
						When he heard someone say,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 135
				-
					-
						"All of your children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 136
				-
					-
						Awhile ago, in play,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 137
				-
					-
						Went into this house.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 138
				-
					-
						Being young and ignorant,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 139
				-
					-
						They delight in play and cling to amusement."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 140
				-
					-
						Having heard this, the elder
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 141
				-
					-
						Entered the burning house, in alarm.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 142
				-
					-
						Intending to save them
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 143
				-
					-
						From being burned
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 144
				-
					-
						He warned his children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 145
				-
					-
						Of the host of disasters:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 146
				-
					-
						"The evil ghosts, the poisonous insects
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 147
				-
					-
						And the speading conflagration,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 148
				-
					-
						A host of sufferings, in succession
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 149
				-
					-
						Are continuous, without interruption.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 150
				-
					-
						The poisonous snakes and vipers
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 151
				-
					-
						And all the Yakshas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 152
				-
					-
						And Kumbhanda ghosts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 153
				-
					-
						Yeh Kan, foxes, and dogs,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 154
				-
					-
						Hawks, vultures, kites, and owls,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 155
				-
					-
						And varieties of centipedes
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 156
				-
					-
						Are frantic with hunger and thirst,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 157
				-
					-
						And terrifying to the extreme.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 158
				-
					-
						There are so many sufferings and troubles,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 159
				-
					-
						So much increased by this great fire!"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 160
				-
					-
						But all the children, without knowledge,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 161
				-
					-
						Although they heard their father's warnings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 162
				-
					-
						Still clung to their amusements
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 163
				-
					-
						And sported without cease.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 164
				-
					-
						At that time, the elder
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 165
				-
					-
						Further had this thought:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 166
				-
					-
						"Being like this, my children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 167
				-
					-
						Add to my worry and distress;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 168
				-
					-
						Now, in this house, there is not
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 169
				-
					-
						A single thing in which to take pleasure,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 170
				-
					-
						And yet all these children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 171
				-
					-
						Are intoxicated by their play.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 172
				-
					-
						Not heeding my instructions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 173
				-
					-
						They will be injured in the fire."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 174
				-
					-
						Just then he thought
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 175
				-
					-
						To devise expedients.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 176
				-
					-
						He said to the children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 177
				-
					-
						"I have all kinds
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 178
				-
					-
						Of precious playthings:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 179
				-
					-
						Fine carriages, wonderful, bejewelled
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 180
				-
					-
						Sheep carts, and deer carts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 181
				-
					-
						And great ox carts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 182
				-
					-
						Now, right outside the door.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 183
				-
					-
						So come out, all of you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 184
				-
					-
						For I have, just for you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 185
				-
					-
						Had these carts made.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 186
				-
					-
						Just as you wish,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 187
				-
					-
						You can play with them."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 188
				-
					-
						When the children heard him speak
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 189
				-
					-
						Of carriages such as these,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 190
				-
					-
						They immediately raced out in a scramble,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 191
				-
					-
						To a clearing where
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 192
				-
					-
						They were then safe from harm.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 193
				-
					-
						The elder, seeing that his children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 194
				-
					-
						Had escaped the burning house,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 195
				-
					-
						And were standing at the crossroads,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 196
				-
					-
						Sat on his lion's throne
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 197
				-
					-
						And rejoiced to himself, saying,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 198
				-
					-
						"Now, I am happy!
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 199
				-
					-
						All of these children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 200
				-
					-
						Were hard to bring into the world and raise;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 201
				-
					-
						Stupid, young, and without knowledge,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 202
				-
					-
						They went into this dangerous house,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 203
				-
					-
						Swarming with poisonous insects
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 204
				-
					-
						And fearful Li Mei ghosts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 205
				-
					-
						Ablaze with a great fire,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 206
				-
					-
						Raging on all sides.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 207
				-
					-
						But all these children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 208
				-
					-
						Still clung to their amusements.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 209
				-
					-
						I have now rescued them
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 210
				-
					-
						And save them from disaster.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 211
				-
					-
						Therefore, of all people,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 212
				-
					-
						I am the happiest!"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 213
				-
					-
						Then, all the children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 214
				-
					-
						Knowing their father was sitting at ease,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 215
				-
					-
						All went before him
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 216
				-
					-
						And addressed him saying,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 217
				-
					-
						"Please give to us the three jewelled carts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 218
				-
					-
						That you promised to us, saying,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 219
				-
					-
						'If you children come out
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 220
				-
					-
						I will give you three carts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 221
				-
					-
						Just like you wanted.'
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 222
				-
					-
						Now the time has come,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 223
				-
					-
						Please give them to us!"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 224
				-
					-
						The elder, having great wealth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 225
				-
					-
						And storehouses containing much
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 226
				-
					-
						Gold, silver, and lapis lazuli,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 227
				-
					-
						Mother-of-pearl and carnelian,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 228
				-
					-
						Used these precious things
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 229
				-
					-
						To make several great carts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 230
				-
					-
						They were decorated and adorned,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 231
				-
					-
						Surrounded by railings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 232
				-
					-
						Hung with bells on all four sides,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 233
				-
					-
						With golden cords strung about them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 234
				-
					-
						And gem-studded nets
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 235
				-
					-
						Spread above them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 236
				-
					-
						There were golden flowered tassels
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 237
				-
					-
						Hanging from them everywhere,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 238
				-
					-
						And various multi-colored ornaments
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 239
				-
					-
						Encircling them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 240
				-
					-
						Soft silk and cotton
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 241
				-
					-
						Made up the cushions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 242
				-
					-
						And fine coverings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 243
				-
					-
						Valued in the thousands of millions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 244
				-
					-
						Pure white and sparkling clean
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 245
				-
					-
						Were spead atop them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 246
				-
					-
						Great white oxen,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 247
				-
					-
						Plump, strong, and powerful,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 248
				-
					-
						Of fine appearance,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 249
				-
					-
						Were yoked to the precious carts.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 250
				-
					-
						They were surrounded by many footmen
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 251
				-
					-
						Who were attending to them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 252
				-
					-
						Such fine carriages as these
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 253
				-
					-
						Were given equally to all the children.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 254
				-
					-
						Then all the children
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 255
				-
					-
						Danced for joy;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 256
				-
					-
						They mounted their jeweled carts
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 257
				-
					-
						And rode off into the four directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 258
				-
					-
						Happily amusing themselves
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 259
				-
					-
						In unobstructed comfort.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 260
				-
					-
						I tell you, Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 261
				-
					-
						I am like this, too,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 262
				-
					-
						The honored among many sages,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 263
				-
					-
						The father of the worlds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 264
				-
					-
						All living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 265
				-
					-
						Are my children;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 266
				-
					-
						Deeply attached to worldly pleasures,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 267
				-
					-
						They have no wise thoughts at all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 268
				-
					-
						In the Three Realms there is no peace;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 269
				-
					-
						They are like a burning house.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 270
				-
					-
						Filled with many sufferings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 271
				-
					-
						And frightening indeed.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 272
				-
					-
						Ever present are the woes
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 273
				-
					-
						Of birth, old age, sickness, death,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 274
				-
					-
						Fires such as these,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 275
				-
					-
						Raging without cease.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 276
				-
					-
						The Thus Come One has already left
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 277
				-
					-
						The Three Realms burning house behind.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 278
				-
					-
						Quietly I dwell at ease,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 279
				-
					-
						In forest and field at peace.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 280
				-
					-
						And now it is, that the Three Realms,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 281
				-
					-
						Entirely belong to me,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 282
				-
					-
						And in them all the living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 283
				-
					-
						Are children of mine.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 284
				-
					-
						But now, this place
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 285
				-
					-
						Is filled with calamities,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 286
				-
					-
						And I am the only one
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 287
				-
					-
						Able to rescue them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 288
				-
					-
						Although I instruct them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 289
				-
					-
						They do not believe or accept,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 290
				-
					-
						Because of their deep attachment and greed
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 291
				-
					-
						Too all the defiling desires.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 292
				-
					-
						Using the expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 293
				-
					-
						I speak to them of Three Vehicles,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 294
				-
					-
						Causing all living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 295
				-
					-
						To understand the pain of the Three Realms.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 296
				-
					-
						I reveal and extensively proclaim
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 297
				-
					-
						The path which transcends the world.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 298
				-
					-
						All of these children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 299
				-
					-
						If they fix their minds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 300
				-
					-
						Can perfect the Three Clarities
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 301
				-
					-
						And the Six Spiritual Powers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 302
				-
					-
						Some shall become Conditioned-enlightened Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 303
				-
					-
						And others irreversible Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 304
				-
					-
						Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 305
				-
					-
						I, for living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 306
				-
					-
						Speak this parable
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 307
				-
					-
						Of the One Buddha Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 308
				-
					-
						If all of you are able
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 309
				-
					-
						To believe and accept these words,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 310
				-
					-
						You shall, in the future,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 311
				-
					-
						Realize the Buddha way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 312
				-
					-
						This vehicle is subtle and wonderful,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 313
				-
					-
						Pure and foremost.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 314
				-
					-
						In all of the worlds
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 315
				-
					-
						It is the most supreme.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 316
				-
					-
						The Buddhas rejoice in it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 317
				-
					-
						And all living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 318
				-
					-
						Should praise it as well.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 319
				-
					-
						Make offerings and bow before it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 320
				-
					-
						Limitless thousands of millions
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 321
				-
					-
						Of powers and liberations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 322
				-
					-
						Dhyana Samadhis and wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 323
				-
					-
						And the Buddhas' other Dharmas
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 324
				-
					-
						Are obtained in a vehicle such as this.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 325
				-
					-
						I cause all my children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 326
				-
					-
						Night and day for many aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 327
				-
					-
						Ever to amuse themselves
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 328
				-
					-
						In the company fo the Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 329
				-
					-
						And the host of Sound Hearers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 330
				-
					-
						Riding this precious vehicle
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 331
				-
					-
						Straight to the field of the way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 332
				-
					-
						For these reasons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 333
				-
					-
						Though they seek in the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 334
				-
					-
						There is no other vehicle
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 335
				-
					-
						Except for the Buddhas' expedients.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 336
				-
					-
						I tell you, Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 337
				-
					-
						That all of you
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 338
				-
					-
						Are my children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 339
				-
					-
						And I am your father.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 340
				-
					-
						For many aeons, you
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 341
				-
					-
						Have been burned by many miseries,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 342
				-
					-
						And I have saved you all,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 343
				-
					-
						Leading you out of the Three Realm.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 344
				-
					-
						Although earlier I said
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 345
				-
					-
						That you had passed into extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 346
				-
					-
						It was only an end to birth and death
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 347
				-
					-
						And not real extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 348
				-
					-
						What you should accomplish now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 349
				-
					-
						Is nothing but the Buddhas' wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 350
				-
					-
						If there are Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 351
				-
					-
						Within this assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 352
				-
					-
						They can singlemindedly listen to
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 353
				-
					-
						The Buddha's real Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 354
				-
					-
						Although the Buddhas, World Honored Ones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 355
				-
					-
						Employ expedient devices,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 356
				-
					-
						The living beings they transform
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 357
				-
					-
						All are Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 358
				-
					-
						If there are those of little wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 359
				-
					-
						Deeply attached to love and desire,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 360
				-
					-
						For their sakes
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 361
				-
					-
						I teach the Truth of Suffering.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 362
				-
					-
						Living beings then rejoice
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 363
				-
					-
						Gaining what they never had,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 364
				-
					-
						Gor the Buddha's teaching of suffering's truth
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 365
				-
					-
						Is true, real, and not false.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 366
				-
					-
						If there are living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 367
				-
					-
						Who do not know the origin of suffering,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 368
				-
					-
						Who are deeply attached to the cause of suffering,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 369
				-
					-
						Unable to leave it for even a moment,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 370
				-
					-
						For their sakes
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 371
				-
					-
						I expediently speak of the path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 372
				-
					-
						The cause of all suffering
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 373
				-
					-
						Is rooted in desire.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 374
				-
					-
						If one extinguishes greed and desire,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 375
				-
					-
						Suffering has nothing to rest upon.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 376
				-
					-
						The extinction of all suffering
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 377
				-
					-
						Is called the third truth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 378
				-
					-
						For the sake of the truth of extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 379
				-
					-
						One cultivates the path;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 380
				-
					-
						Leaving all suffering's bonds
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 381
				-
					-
						Is called the attainment of liberation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 382
				-
					-
						From what is it
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 383
				-
					-
						That these people have been liberated?
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 384
				-
					-
						The mere separation from the false
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 385
				-
					-
						Is called liberation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 386
				-
					-
						In reality they have not yet
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 387
				-
					-
						Attained total liberation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 388
				-
					-
						The Buddha says that these people
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 389
				-
					-
						Have not yet truly reached extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 390
				-
					-
						Because they have not yet attained
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 391
				-
					-
						The unsurpassed path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 392
				-
					-
						It is not my wish
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 393
				-
					-
						To lead them to extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 394
				-
					-
						I am the Dharma king,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 395
				-
					-
						At ease within all the Dharmas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 396
				-
					-
						I manifest within this world
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 397
				-
					-
						To bring peace and tranquility to living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 398
				-
					-
						Shariputra!
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 399
				-
					-
						This Dharma seal of mine
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 400
				-
					-
						Is spoken because I wish
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 401
				-
					-
						To benefit the world.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 402
				-
					-
						Wherever you roam,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 403
				-
					-
						Do not propagate it wrongly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 404
				-
					-
						If there be those who hear it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 405
				-
					-
						And rejoice, receiving it atop their crowns,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 406
				-
					-
						You should know that such people
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 407
				-
					-
						Are Avaivartika.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 408
				-
					-
						Those who believe and accept
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 409
				-
					-
						The Dharma of this Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 410
				-
					-
						These people have already seen
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 411
				-
					-
						The Buddhas of the past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 412
				-
					-
						Reverently making offerings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 413
				-
					-
						And hearing this Dharma as well.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 414
				-
					-
						Those who are able
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 415
				-
					-
						To believe what you say,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 416
				-
					-
						They then see me,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 417
				-
					-
						And they see you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 418
				-
					-
						And also the Bhikshusangha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 419
				-
					-
						As well as all the Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 420
				-
					-
						This Sutra of the Dharma flower
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 421
				-
					-
						Is spoken for those of profound wisdom;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 422
				-
					-
						When those of shallow understanding hear it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 423
				-
					-
						Confused and deluded, they fail to understand it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 424
				-
					-
						The Sound Hearers, every one,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 425
				-
					-
						And the Pratyeka Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 426
				-
					-
						Find the contents of this Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 427
				-
					-
						Far beyond their powers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 428
				-
					-
						You, Shariputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 429
				-
					-
						Gained entry to this Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 430
				-
					-
						By means of faith.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 431
				-
					-
						How much the more so other Sound Hearers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 432
				-
					-
						Those Sound Hearers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 433
				-
					-
						Because of their faith in the Buddha's words,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 434
				-
					-
						Comply with this Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 435
				-
					-
						But it's beyond ther range of their own wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 436
				-
					-
						Further, Shariputra
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 437
				-
					-
						To the arrogant and lazy
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 438
				-
					-
						And those who reckon the view of self,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 439
				-
					-
						Do not speak this Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 440
				-
					-
						Common folk of shallow understanding,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 441
				-
					-
						Deeply attached to the Five Desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 442
				-
					-
						Hearing it, will fail to understand;
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 443
				-
					-
						Do not speak it to them, either.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 444
				-
					-
						If there be those who don't believe,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 445
				-
					-
						And who slander this Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 446
				-
					-
						They thereby sever all
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 447
				-
					-
						Worldly Buddha seeds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 448
				-
					-
						Or if, with a scowl,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 449
				-
					-
						They harbor doubts and delusions
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 450
				-
					-
						You should listen now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 451
				-
					-
						As I sepak of their offense-retribution:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 452
				-
					-
						Whether a Buddha is in the world,
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 453
				-
					-
						Or has entered into extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Verse 62: Line 454
				-
					-
						If there be those who slander
					-

				Chapter 4: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time the wise and long-lived Subhuti, Mahakatyayana, Mahakashyapa,
					Mahamaudgalyayana, having heard from the Buddha, Dharma such as they had never
					heard before, the bestowal of the prediction of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi upon
					Shariputra, felt it very rare. They rose from their seats, jumped for joy,
					straightened their robes, bared their right shoulders, placed their right knees
					on the ground, singlemindedly put their palms together, inclined themselves
					respectfully, gazed at the Honored Countenance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And spoke to the Buddha, saying, "We, who dwell at the head of the Sangha and
					are advanced in years, told ourselves that we had already attained Nirvana and
					had no further responsibility, and we did not go forward to seek
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"The World Honored One has, from of old, been speaking the Dharma for a long
					time, sitting here all this time, our bodies tired, we have merely been mindful
					of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, taking no delight in the
					Bodhisattva-Dharmas, in their Samadhis of playfulness, in their purification of
					Buddhalands, or in their maturation of living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? The World Honored One has led us to escape the Three
					Realms and attain certification to Nirvana. Besides, we are now advanced in
					years and when the Buddha taught the Bodhisattvas of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, we
					did not give rise to even a single thought of longing for it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"Now, in the presence of the Buddha, having heard him bestow upon the Sound
					Hearers the Anuttarasamyaksambodhi prediction, our hearts rejoice
					enthusiastically and we obtain what we never have had. We never thought that
					now we would suddenly be able to hear this rare Dharma. We rejoice profoundly,
					having gained great and good benefit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"It is as if, without our seeking them, limitless precious gems had come into
					our possession.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, we would now like to speak a parable to clarify this
					principle.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"It is as if there were a person who, in his youth, left his father and ran
					away, dwelling long in another country, perhaps ten, twenty or even fifty
					years.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"As he grew older, he became poor and needy and ran about in the four
					directions in search of clothing and food. Gradually he wandered until he
					accidentally approached his native land.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"His father, from the first, had set out seeking his son but in vain. He
					settled midway in a city. His household was one of great wealth, with limitless
					wealth and jewels, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls,
					and other jewels. His granaries and treasures were overflowing, and he had many
					servants, ministers and assistants, as well as countless elephants, horses,
					carriages, cattle, and sheep. The profits from his trade extended to the other
					countries, and there were also many traders and merchants.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Then the poor son, having wandered through various villages and passed through
					countries and cities, at last reached the city where his father had settled.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"The father had always been mindful of his son. Although they had been
					separated for over fifty years, he had never spoken of the matter to anyone,
					but merely pondered over it, his heart filled with regret as he thought, 'I am
					old and decrepit. I have much wealth, gold, silver, and precious gems,
					granaries and storehouses filled to overflowing. Such a pity that I have no
					son! One day I'm bound to die, and when I do, my wealth will be scattered and
					lost, for I have no one to bequeath them to.' This is why he ever earnestly
					thought of his son. 'If I could only get my son back, I'd make him heir to my
					wealth. I'd be contented, and happy and have no further worries.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, the poor son then, hiring himself as a laborer here and
					there, unexpectedly arrived at this father's house. Standing by the gate, he
					saw his father seated on a Lion-seat. His feet were resting on a jeweled
					footstool, and he was reverently surrounded by Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and
					laypeople. Necklaces of real pearls, their value in the millions, adorned his
					body. Attendants and servants, holding white whisks, waited on him right and
					left. Above him was a jeweled canopy hung with flowers and pennants. Fragrant
					water was sprinkled on the ground, and expensive flowers were scattered about.
					Precious objects were placed in rows, which were passed out and taken in on
					leaving and entering. Such were the adornments, and the majesty and authority
					of his awesome virtue. When the poor soon saw his father, possessed of such
					great power, he was immediately afraid and regretted having come there.
					Secretly he thought, 'This is perhaps a king, or one equal to a king. This is
					no place for me to hire myself out. I'd better go to a poor village where there
					will be room for me to work and where I can easily obtain clothing and food. If
					I stay here any longer, I may be forced to work.' And with this thought, he
					quickly ran off.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"Then the wealthy elder, seated on the Lion-seat, seeing his son, recognized
					him and his heart rejoiced greatly, as he thought, 'I now have someone to whom
					I can bequeath my wealth and treasures. I have constantly been mindful of my
					son, but had no way of seeing him. Then, all of a sudden, he came on his own,
					and my wish has been fulfilled. Although I am old and decrepit I still longed
					for him with regret.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"He then sent attendants to follow him and bring him back. Thereupon, the
					servants quickly apprehended him. The poor son in alarm shouted in resentment,
					'I have committed no offense. Why have I been seized?' The servants, with even
					greater haste, grabbed him and dragged him back. The poor son thought to
					himself, 'I am blameless and yet have been imprisoned. This surely means that I
					will die,' and, even more frightened, he fainted and fell to the ground.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"The father saw his son from afar and said to the servant, 'I do not need this
					person. Do not force him to come along. Sprinkle cold water on his face to
					bring him to, but do not speak further with him'. Why was this? The father knew
					that his son's resolve and will were inferior and lowly, and that his own
					nobility was a source of difficulty to his son. Therefore, although he was
					certain that this was his son, he expediently refrained from telling anyone,
					'This is my son.' The servant said to the son, 'I now set you free. You may go
					wherever you wish.' The poor son was delighted, having gained what he had never
					had before. He rose from the ground and went to a poor village to seek clothing
					and food.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Then the elder, wishing to induce his son, set up an expedient and secretly
					sent two people, haggard and undignified in appearance, saying to them, 'You
					may go there and gently speak to that poor one. Tell him there is a place for
					him to work here where he can earn twice as much. If he agrees, bring him back
					and put him to work. If he asks what he is to do, tell him, 'You are being
					hired to sweep out dung. We two will work along with you'.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"Then the two servants sought out the poor son, and when they found him, they
					told him the above matter in detail.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"At that time the poor son first took his salary and then joined them in
					sweeping away the dung. When the father saw his son, he felt pity and
					amazement.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 20
			-
				-
					"Later, on another day, through a window, he saw his son at a distance, thin,
					haggard, soiled with dung, dirt, and filth. He then removed his necklace of
					beads, his soft upper garments, and his adornments and put on a coarse, worn
					out, and filthy robe, smeared himself with dirt and holding a dung shovel,
					looking frightful. He addressed his workers, saying, 'All of you, work hard! Do
					not be lax.' By this device he draws near to his son, to whom he later says,
					'Hey, my boy! you should stay here and work. Don't go elsewhere. I will
					increase your wages. Whatever you need, be it pots, utensils, rice, flour, salt
					or vinegar or other such things, don't trouble yourself about it. I also have
					an old worn out servant you can have if you need him. So put your mind at rest.
					I am like your father, so have no more worries. Why? I am very old, and you are
					young and strong. Whenever you are working, you are never deceitful, remiss,
					angry, hateful, or grumbling. I have never seen you commit such evils as I have
					the other workers. From now on you shall be just like my own son.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"Just then the elder gave him a name, calling him his son. The poor son,
					although delighted at his happening, still referred to himself as a lowly
					worker from outside. For this reason, for twenty years he was constantly kept
					at work sweeping away dung.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"After this, they trusted one another, and he came and went without difficulty.
					However, he still stayed in the same place as before.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 23
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, at that time, the elder grew sick and knew he would die
					before long. He said to the poor son, 'I now possess much gold, silver, and
					jewels, and my granaries and storehouses are filled to overflowing. You should
					know the detail their quantities and the amounts to be received and given. Such
					are my thoughts, and you should understand what I mean. What is the reason? You
					and I are now no difference. You should be even more careful that nothing be
					lost.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 24
			-
				-
					"At that time, the poor son, having received these instructions, took charge of
					all the goods, the gold, silver, and precious gems, as well as the granaries
					and storehouses, and yet he did not long for so much as a single meal. He
					continued to stay in the same place, still unable to let go of his lowly
					thoughts.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 25
			-
				-
					"After a short while, the father knew that his son had grown more relaxed, that
					he had accomplished the great resolve and despised his former state of mind.
					Knowing that his own end was near, he ordered his son to gather ministers,
					Kshatriyas, and laypeople. When they had all assembled, he spoke to them
					saying, 'All of you gentlemen should know that this is my son, begotten by me.
					In a certain city, he left me and ran away to suffer desolation, poverty, and
					hardship for over fifty years. His original name was such and such, and my name
					was such. Long ago, in my native city, I anxiously sought him. This is really
					my son. I am really his father. All of my wealth now belongs to my son,and all
					that has been paid out and taken in is known by him.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, when the poor son heard what his father had said, he
					rejoiced greatly, having obtained what he had never had, and he thought,
					'Originally, I had no thought to seek anything, and now this treasury has come
					to me of itself.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 27
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, the great and wealthy elder is the Thus Come One. We are
					all like the Buddha's sons. The Thus Come One always says that we are his sons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 28
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, because of the three kinds of sufferings, we have suffered
					much torment in the midst of births and deaths. Deluded and ignorant, we clung
					to petty Dharmas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 29
			-
				-
					"Today, the World Honored One has caused us to think about getting rid of the
					dung of frivolous discussions of the Dharma. We increased our vigor to earn one
					day's wage of Nirvana. Having attained this, our hearts rejoiced greatly, and
					we were content, saying to ourselves that, through our diligence and vigor,
					what we had gained in the Buddhadharma was plentiful.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"However, the World Honored One, knowing all along that our minds were attached
					to lowly desires and took delight in petty Dharmas, let us go our own way and
					did not specify to us saying, 'You are all to have a share in the treasury of
					the Thus Come One's knowledge and vision.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 31
			-
				-
					"The World Honored One, using the power of expedient devices, has spoken of the
					Thus Come One's wisdom. Having gained from the Buddha the one day's wage of
					Nirvana, we took it to be a great attainment; we had no ambition to seek the
					Great Vehicle. Besides, the wisdom of the Thus Come One had been set forth for
					the sake of the Bodhisattvas, and so he held no expectations regarding it. What
					is the reason? The Buddha knew that our minds took delight in petty Dharmas. He
					used the power of expedients to teach us in the appropriate manner, and we did
					not know that we were truly the Buddha's sons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"Now we know that the World Honored One is by no means ungenerous with the
					Buddha's wisdom. Why? From of old, we truly have been the Buddha's sons, and
					yet we delighted only in petty Dharmas. If we had thought to delight in the
					great, the Buddha would then have spoken for us the Great Vehicle Dharma. This
					Sutra speaks of only One Vehicle. In the past, in the presence of the
					Bodhisattvas, the Buddha had belittled the Sound Hearers who delight in lesser
					Dharmas, but he was actually employing the Great Vehicle in teaching and
					transforming them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"Therefore, we say that originally we had not hoped for or sought anything, and
					yet now these great jewels of the Dharma King have come to us of themselves.
					That which the Buddha's sons should attain, we have already attained."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4: Verse 34
			-
				-
					At that time, Mahakashyapa, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses,
					saying,
				-
				-

				-
					-
						We, on this day,

				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 2

				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 44
				-

						Morning and evening, his only thought was,

						"My time of death is drawing near.

				-
					-
						Whatever shall I do with them?"
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then the poor son,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 51
				-
					-
						Seeking clothing and food,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 52
				-
					-
						Went from city to city,

						Within his gateway,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 64

					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 70
				-
					-
						His income and expenses were
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 71
				-
					-
						Recorded there on ledgers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 72
				-
					-
						When the poor son saw his father,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 73
				-
					-
						Of such nobility and wealth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 74
				-
					-
						He said, "This must be a king,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 75
				-
					-
						Or the equal of a king."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 76
				-
					-
						In fright, he reproved himself,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 77
				-
					-
						"Why have I come here?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 78
				-
					-
						And further to himself, he said,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 79
				-
					-
						"If I stay here long,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 80
				-
					-
						I may be oppressed
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 81
				-
					-
						And forced to go to work."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 82
				-
					-
						Having had this thought,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 83
				-
					-
						He hurriedly ran off
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 84
				-
					-
						To a poor village, asking
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 85
				-
					-
						To be hired out to work.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 86
				-
					-
						Just then, the elder,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 87
				-
					-
						Seated on the Lion-throne,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 88
				-
					-
						Saw his son at a distance,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 89
				-
					-
						And silently recognized him.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 90
				-
					-
						He then commanded his attendants to seize him and bring him back.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 91
				-
					-
						The poor son cried out in alarm,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 92
				-
					-
						And fainted, falling to the ground.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 93
				-
					-
						"These people have caught me!
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 94
				-
					-
						I shall certainly be killed!
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 95
				-
					-
						Why, for food and clothing's sake
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 96
				-
					-
						Did I come to this place?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 97
				-
					-
						The elder knew that his son
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 98
				-
					-
						Was foolish and lowly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 99
				-
					-
						"He wouldn't believe me if I told him.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 100
				-
					-
						He wouldn't believe tha I am his father."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 101
				-
					-
						Then he used an expedient,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 102
				-
					-
						And sent some other men,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 103
				-
					-
						One-eyed, squat, and ugly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 104
				-
					-
						Lacking awesome virtue.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 105
				-
					-
						"Speak to him," he said.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 106
				-
					-
						"And tell him, 'You will work with us
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 107
				-
					-
						Getting rid of dung and filth
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 108
				-
					-
						At twic your normal wages.'"
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 109
				-
					-
						When the poor son heard this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 110
				-
					-
						He happily followed them back
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 111
				-
					-
						And swept out the dung and filth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 112
				-
					-
						Cleaning all the dwellings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 113
				-
					-
						From his window, the elder
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 114
				-
					-
						Would often watch his son,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 115
				-
					-
						Remembering that he was foolish and lowly
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 116
				-
					-
						And enjoyed menial work.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 117
				-
					-
						Then the elder
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 118
				-
					-
						Put on a worn and dirty robe,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 119
				-
					-
						And, holding a dung shovel,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 120
				-
					-
						Went to where his son was.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 121
				-
					-
						Expediently drawing near to him,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 122
				-
					-
						He said, "Work with diligence,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 123
				-
					-
						For I have increased your wages,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 124
				-
					-
						And shall give you oil for your feet,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 125
				-
					-
						And your fill of food and drink,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 126
				-
					-
						And thick, warm bedding."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 127
				-
					-
						Thus he spoke sharply saying,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 128
				-
					-
						"You must work hard!"
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 129
				-
					-
						And then in gentler tones, he added,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 130
				-
					-
						"You are like my own son."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 131
				-
					-
						The elder, in his wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 132
				-
					-
						Eventually allowed him to come and go.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 133
				-
					-
						For a period of twenty years,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 134
				-
					-
						He was put in charge of household business.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 135
				-
					-
						He showed him his gold, silver,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 136
				-
					-
						Real pearls and crystal.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 137
				-
					-
						The income and expense of all these things,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 138
				-
					-
						He was caused to know.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 139
				-
					-
						And yet the son still lived outside the gate,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 140
				-
					-
						Dwelling in a grass hut
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 141
				-
					-
						Thinking of his poverty:
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 142
				-
					-
						"None of these things are mine."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 143
				-
					-
						The father knew his son's mind
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 144
				-
					-
						Gradually had expanded,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 145
				-
					-
						And wishing to give him wealth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 146
				-
					-
						He gathered together his relatives,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 147
				-
					-
						The kings,and great ministers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 148
				-
					-
						The Kshatriyas and laypeople.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 149
				-
					-
						In the midst of this great assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 150
				-
					-
						He said, "This is my son.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 151
				-
					-
						He left me and went away
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 152
				-
					-
						Fifty years ago.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 153
				-
					-
						And it has been twenty years
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 154
				-
					-
						Since I saw him return.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 155
				-
					-
						Long ago in a certain city
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 156
				-
					-
						I lost my son.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 157
				-
					-
						Searching for him everywhere,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 158
				-
					-
						I came to this place.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 159
				-
					-
						Everything that I own,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 160
				-
					-
						My houses and servants,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 161
				-
					-
						I bequeath it all to him
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 162
				-
					-
						That he may use it as he pleases."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 163
				-
					-
						The son, recalling his former poverty
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 164
				-
					-
						And his lowly intentions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 165
				-
					-
						Who now, in his father's presence
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 166
				-
					-
						Had obtained these precious jewels,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 167
				-
					-
						And these dwelling places,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 168
				-
					-
						And all such wealth,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 169
				-
					-
						Greatly rejoiced,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 170
				-
					-
						Having gained what he'd never had.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 171
				-
					-
						The Buddha in the same way
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 172
				-
					-
						Knew our fondess for the petty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 173
				-
					-
						And so he never said to us,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 174
				-
					-
						"You shall become Buddhas."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 175
				-
					-
						Instead he said that we
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 176
				-
					-
						Could attain cessation of all outflows,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 177
				-
					-
						Realize the lesser vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 178
				-
					-
						And become Sound Hearer Disciples.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 179
				-
					-
						The Buddha had instructed us
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 180
				-
					-
						To speak of the unsurpassed Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 181
				-
					-
						And spoken of those who practice it
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 182
				-
					-
						As being able to accomplish Buddhahood.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 183
				-
					-
						Receiving the Buddha's teaching, we
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 184
				-
					-
						For the sake of the Great Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 185
				-
					-
						Use causes and conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 186
				-
					-
						Various analogies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 187
				-
					-
						And numerous expressions
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 188
				-
					-
						To speak of the unsurpassed Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 189
				-
					-
						All the Buddha's disciples.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 190
				-
					-
						Having heard from us this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 191
				-
					-
						Think upon it day and night,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 192
				-
					-
						And diligently practice it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 193
				-
					-
						Thereupon, all the Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 194
				-
					-
						Then bestow predictions upon them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 195
				-
					-
						Saying, "You, in a future age,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 196
				-
					-
						Shall become Buddhas."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 197
				-
					-
						This is the secret store of Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 198
				-
					-
						Of all the Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 199
				-
					-
						Only for the Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 200
				-
					-
						Are such real matters set forth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 201
				-
					-
						And not for our sakes
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 202
				-
					-
						Have such true essentials been spoken.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 203
				-
					-
						Just as the poor son
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 204
				-
					-
						Drew near his father, and
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 205
				-
					-
						Although he knew of all his possessions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 206
				-
					-
						In his heart he held no hope of getting them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 207
				-
					-
						In just the same way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 208
				-
					-
						Even though we have spoken
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 209
				-
					-
						Of the Buddhadharma's precious store,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 210
				-
					-
						we personally never aspired to it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 211
				-
					-
						Having attained inner-extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 212
				-
					-
						We thought this sufficient,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 213
				-
					-
						For having completed this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 214
				-
					-
						There was nothing else to be done.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 215
				-
					-
						And even if we had heard
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 216
				-
					-
						Of purifying Buddhalands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 217
				-
					-
						And teaching and transforming living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 218
				-
					-
						We'd have taken no delight therein,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 219
				-
					-
						And for what reason?
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 220
				-
					-
						All Dharmas are
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 221
				-
					-
						Completely empty and still,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 222
				-
					-
						Neither produced nor destroyed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 223
				-
					-
						Neither great nor small,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 224
				-
					-
						Without outflows and unconditioned.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 225
				-
					-
						Reflecting in this way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 226
				-
					-
						We did not give rise to joy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 227
				-
					-
						During the long night,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 228
				-
					-
						We had no craving or attachment
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 229
				-
					-
						For the Buddha's wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 230
				-
					-
						Nor did we aspire to it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 231
				-
					-
						Yet, as to Dharma, we
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 232
				-
					-
						Claimed we had the ultimate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 233
				-
					-
						All through the long night,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 234
				-
					-
						We practiced and cultivated the
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 235
				-
					-
						Dharma of emptiness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 236
				-
					-
						Having won release from theThree Realms
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 237
				-
					-
						With its suffering, distress and calamities,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 238
				-
					-
						We dwell within our final bodies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 239
				-
					-
						In Nirvana with residue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 240
				-
					-
						According to the Buddha's teaching,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 241
				-
					-
						We attained the Way which is not false,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 242
				-
					-
						And we assumed that we had
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 243
				-
					-
						Thereby repaid the Buddha's kindness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 244
				-
					-
						Although we, for the sake
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 245
				-
					-
						Of the Buddha's disciples spoke
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 246
				-
					-
						Of the Bodhisattvas Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 247
				-
					-
						with which they should seek Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 248
				-
					-
						Still in this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 249
				-
					-
						We never took delight at all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 250
				-
					-
						Our master saw this and let things be,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 251
				-
					-
						Because he saw into our hearts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 252
				-
					-
						And so, at first, he did not encourage us
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 253
				-
					-
						By telling of the real advantage.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 254
				-
					-
						Just as the wealthy elder
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 255
				-
					-
						Used the power of expedients
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 256
				-
					-
						To bring his mind under control,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 257
				-
					-
						And afterwards gave to him
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 258
				-
					-
						All of his valuables,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 259
				-
					-
						The Buddha in the same way
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 260
				-
					-
						Manifests rare things,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 261
				-

				-
					-
						Within the non-outflow Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 274
				-
					-
						We've gained the eye, pure and clear.

						During the long night, we

						In the Dharma King's Dharma,

						the unsurpassed, great fruition.

						We cause all to hear it.

						Or further, if one used delicacies,

						The Buddhas are rare indeed.

						Without outflows, unconditioned,

						They are Kings of all the Dharmas.

				-
					-
						For the sake of lesser beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 326

				-
					-
						To common folks who grasp at marks,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 328

						They teach what is appropriate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 329
				-
					-
						The Buddhas have, within the Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 330
				-
					-
						Attained to the highest comfort.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 331
				-

						They understand all living beings'

				-
					-
						Various desires and delights,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 333

						As well as the strength of their resolve,

						According to what they can bear,

				-
					-
						Using limitless analogies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 336
				-

						They teach them the Dharma,

				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 337
				-
					-
						In accord with living beings'
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Verse 34: Line 338

						Wholesome roots from former lives.

						And knowing those who have matured,

						And those who have not yet matured,

						Through such calculations,

				Chapter 5: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honorded One told Mahakashyapa and all the great
					disciples, "Good indeed! Good indeed! Kashyapa has well spoken of the Thus Come
					One's real and true merit and virtue. It is just as he said. Furthermore, the
					Thus Come One has limitless, boundless Asankheyas of merit and virtue. If you
					were to speak of it throughout limitless millions of aeons, you could not
					finish.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"Kashyapa, you should know that the Thus Come One is the king of all the
					Dharmas. Nothing that he teaches is false. He extensively proclaims all Dharmas
					by means of wisdom and expedients, and whatever Dharmas he speaks all lead to
					the ground of all wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"The Thus Come One contemplates and knows the tendencies of all Dharmas. He
					also knows the depths of the mental processes of all living beings, having
					penetrated them without obstruction. Furthermore, he has ultimate and clear
					understanding of all Dharmas, and he instructs living beings in all-wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"Kashyapa, consider the world of three thousand great thousand worlds and the
					grasses, trees, forests, as well as the medicinal herbs, in their many
					varieties, with their different names and colors which the mountains, streams,
					valleys and flatlands produce. A thick cloud spreads out, covering the three
					thousand great thousand worlds, raining on them equally everywhere at the same
					time, its moisture reaching every part. The grasses, trees, forests and
					medicinal herbs - those of small roots, small stalks, small branches and small
					leaves, those of medium-sized roots, medium-sized stalks, medium-sized
					branches, medium-sized leaves or those of large roots, large stalks, large
					branches, and large leaves, and also all the trees, whether great or small,
					according to their size, small, medium, or large, all receive a portion of it.
					From the rain of the one cloud each according to its nature grows, blossoms,
					and bears fruit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Although they grow from the same ground and are moistened by the same rain,
					still, all the grasses and trees are different.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Kashyapa, you should know that the Thus Come One is also like this. He
					manifests in the world like a great cloud rising; with his great sound he
					covers the world with its gods, humans, and Asuras, just like that great cloud
					covers the three thousand great thousand lands. In the midst of the great
					assembly he announces, "I am the Thus Come One, one worthy of offerings, one of
					proper and universal knowledge, one whose understanding and conduct are
					complete, well gone one who understands the world, an unsurpassed lord, a
					taming and regulating hero, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the World
					Honored One. Those who have not yet been crossed over, I cross over. Those who
					have not yet been liberated, I liberate. Those who have not yet been put at
					rest, I put at rest. Those who have not yet attained Nirvana, I cause to attain
					Nirvana. I know things as they really are, both in the present and in the
					future. I am the all-knowing one, the all-seeing one, the one who knows the
					Way, the one who opens the Way, the one who proclaims the Way. The entire
					assembly of gods, humans and Asuras, all should come here to listen to the
					Dharma."
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Then, countless thousands of myriads of millions of kinds of living beings came
					before the Buddha to hear the Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Then, the Thus Come One, contemplating the sharpness and dullness of the
					faculties of these living beings, their vigor or laxness, according to their
					capacity, spoke the Dharma for their sakes in limitless varieties, causing them
					all to rejoice and quickly attain good benefit. After having heard this Dharma,
					all of these living beings presently are at ease; in the future, they will be
					born in a good place. By means of the Way, they will enjoy happiness and also
					be able to hear the Dharma. Having heard the Dharma, they will separate from
					all coverings and obstructions. Within all the Dharmas, according to their
					powers, they will gradually gain entry to the Way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Just as that great cloud rains down on all the grasses, trees, forests, and
					medicinal herbs and each, according to its nature, fully receives the moisture
					and grows.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 10
			-
				-
					So, too, the Thus Come One speaks of a Dharma having one mark and one taste,
					that is to say: the mark of liberation, the mark of extinction, culminating in
					the wisdom of all modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Those living beings who, hearing the Thus Come One's Dharma, uphold read,
					recite and cultivate it as taught will not themselves be aware of the merit and
					virtue they obtain.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 12
			-
				-
					What is the reason? Only the Thus Come One knows the kinds, the marks, the
					substances, and the natures of these living beings, what they are recollecting,
					what they are thinking, and what they are cultivating; how they are
					recollecting, how they are thinking, and how they are cultivating; by means of
					what Dharma they cultivate; and by means of what Dharma they obtain what
					Dharma. Living beings dwell on a variety of levels. Only the Thus Come One sees
					them as they really are, clearly and without obstruction. Just as those
					grasses, trees, and forests and all the medicinal herbs do not know themselves
					whether their natures are superior, middle, or inferior.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 13
			-
				-
					The Thus Come One knows the Dharma of one mark, of one flavor, that is to say:
					the mark of liberation, the mark of separation, the mark of extinction, the
					mark of ultimate Nirvana which is constantly still and extinct and which in the
					end returns to emptiness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 14
			-
				-
					Already understanding this the Buddha contemplates the desires in the minds of
					living beings and protects them. For this reason he does not immediately speak
					of the wisdom of all modes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 15
			-
				-
					Kashyapa, you are all very rare in your ability to know that the Thus Come One
					speaks the Dharma as it is appropriate, and in your ability to believe and
					accept it. Why is this? All the Buddhas, the World Honored Ones speak an
					appropriate Dharma which is difficult to understand, difficult to know.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5: Verse 16
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning spoke
					verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 1
				-
					-
						Destroyer of existence, the Dharma King
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 2
				-
					-
						Manifests within the world;
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 3
				-
					-
						According to living beings' desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 4
				-
					-
						He teaches the Dharma in various ways.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 5
				-
					-
						The Thus Come One, out of veneration
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 6
				-
					-
						For this wisdom, deep and far-reaching,
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 7
				-
					-
						Has long remained silent on this important matter.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 8
				-
					-
						Being in no hurry to set it forth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 9
				-
					-
						Those with wisdom, if they heard it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 10
				-
					-
						Would be able to believe and understand it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 11
				-
					-
						But those lacking wisdom would doubt it
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 12
				-
					-
						And thereby lose it for a long time
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 13
				-
					-
						for this reason, Kashyapa,
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 14
				-
					-
						It is spoken in accord with their powers
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 15
				-
					-
						Employing various conditions
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 16
				-
					-
						To lead them to the right view.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 17
				-
					-
						Kashyapa, you should know
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 18
				-
					-
						It is like a great cloud
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 19
				-
					-
						Rising above the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Verse 16: Line 20

						Refreshing the earth

					and humans, a Buddha, a World Honored One. His country will be called Light
					Virtue and his aeon will be called Great Adornment. His lifespan as a Buddha

			-
				Chapter 6: Verse 5
			-
				-
					At that time, Mahamaudgalyayana, Subhuti and Mahakatyayana were very agitated.
					They single-mindedly joined their palms, gazed upward at the World Honored One,
					not lowering their gaze for a moment, and with a single voice spoke these
					verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 1
				-
					-
						Great, brave hero, the World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 2
				-
					-
						The Shakyan Dharma King,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 3
				-
					-
						Out of pity for us all
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 4
				-
					-
						Bestow the Buddha Word!
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 5
				-
					-
						If, knowing our profoundest thoughts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 6
				-
					-
						you see that we gain predictions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 7
				-
					-
						It will be like a sprinkling of sweet dew,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 8
				-
					-
						Dispelling heat and giving cool refreshment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 9
				-
					-
						It'll be like a person from a famine-stricken land,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 10
				-
					-
						who suddenly encounters a royal feast:
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 11
				-
					-
						His mind holds doubt and fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 12
				-
					-
						And he doesn't dare go ahead and eat.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 13
				-
					-
						But, if he gained the king's permission,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 14
				-
					-
						Then he would certainly dare to eat.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 15
				-
					-
						We, in the same way, ever think
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 16
				-
					-
						Of the errors of the Small Vehicle
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 17
				-
					-
						And do not know how we are
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 18
				-
					-
						To gain the Buddhas unsurpassed wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 19
				-
					-
						Although we hear the Buddha's voice
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 20
				-
					-
						Saying that we shall become Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 21
				-
					-
						Our minds hold worry and fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 22
				-
					-
						Like one who dares not yet to eat.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 23
				-
					-
						If we were favored by the Buddha's prediction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 24
				-
					-
						Then we should be happy and at peace.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 25
				-
					-
						Great, brave hero, World Honored One,

				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 26
				-
					-
						You who always wish peace for the world

				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 27
				-
					-
						Please bestow predictions upon us
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Verse 5: Line 28
				-
					-
						Like giving the famished permission to eat!
					-
			-
				Chapter 6: Verse 6
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of his
					great disciples, told the Bhikshus, "Subhuti will in a future age serve and
					behold three hundreds of myriads of millions of Nayutas of Buddhas, making
					offerings, paying reverence, venerating, and praising them, ever cultivating
					the Brahman conduct, and perfecting the Bodhisattva Way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 6: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"In his final body, he will become a Buddha called Name Appearance Thus Come
					One, one worthy of offerings, of proper and universal knowledge, one whose
					understanding and conduct are complete, a well-gone one who understands the
					world, an unsurpassed lord, a taming and regulating hero, teacher of gods and
					humans, Buddha, World Honored One. His aeon will be called Possessing-Jewels.
					His country will be called Giving Birth to Jewels. His land will be level, with
					crystal for soil, and jeweled trees for adornments. It will be without hills or
					gullys, stones, thorns, filth or excrement. Jeweled flowers will cover the
					ground, purifying it entirely. The people of his land will all dwell on jeweled
					terraces or in precious, fine towers. The assembly of Sound Hearers will be
					limitless and boundless, so that they cannot be known by resort to number or
					analogy. The assembly of Bodhisattvas will number in the countless thousands of
					myriads of millions of Nayutas. His lifespan as a Buddha will last for twelve
					minor aeons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 6: Verse 8
			-
				-
					The Proper Dharma will dwell there for twenty mino aeons. The Dharma Image Age
					will also dwell there for twenty mino aeons. This Buddha will constantly dwell
					in empty space speaking Dharma for the multitudes and crossing over limitless
					Bodhisattvas and Sound Hearers."

				Chapter 6: Verse 9
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this principle spoke

				Chapter 7: Verse 1
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bhikshus, "long ago, past limitless, boundless,
					unconceivable, Asankheya aeons, there was a Buddha called
					Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory, Thus Come One, One Worthy of Offerings, One
					of Proper and Universal Knowledge, One Whose Understanding and Conduct are
					Complete, Well-Gone One Who Understands the World, Unsurpassed Lord, Taming and
					Regulating Hero, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World Honored One. His
					country was named "Good City", and his aeon was named "Great Mark". O Bhikshus,
					it has been a great, long time since that Buddha passed into extinction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Suppose someone were to grind all the earth in the three thousand great
					thousand worlds into ink powder, and then suppose he passed through a thousand
					lands to the east and then dropped a particle the size of a mote of dust, and
					then passing through another thousand lands deposited another mote, and
					continued to do this until all the ink made of earth was exhausted. What do you
					think? Could a mathematician or his disciple ever reach the limit of the lands
					and know their number?
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"No, World Honored One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"O Bhikshus, if the lands this person had passed through, whether or not he set
					down a particle in them, were all ground into dust, and if each dust mote was
					equal to an aeon, then the time since that Buddha passed into extinction would
					exceed their number by limitless, boundless, hundreds of thousands of tens of
					thousands of millions of Asankheya aeons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Using the power of the Thus Come One's knowledge and vision, I behold that time
					in the distant past as if it were today.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 6
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 1
				-
					-
						"I recall that in a past age,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 2
				-
					-
						Limitless, boundless aeons ago,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 3
				-
					-
						There was a Buddha, doubly honored,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 4
				-
					-
						By the name of Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 5
				-
					-
						Suppose a person ground
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 6
				-
					-
						All of the earth that there was
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 7
				-
					-
						In three thousand great thousand lands
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 8
				-
					-
						Entirely into ink powder;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 9
				-
					-
						And then suppose he passed through a thousand lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 10
				-
					-
						And then let fall one particle of it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 11
				-
					-
						Continuing to drop particles in this way
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 12
				-
					-
						Until all the ink particles were gone.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 13
				-
					-
						Suppose all of the countries he passed through,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 14
				-
					-
						Whether he dropped particles in them or not,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 15
				-
					-
						Again were completely ground into dust motes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 16
				-
					-
						And each dust mote were an aeon;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 17
				-
					-
						These grains of dust would in number
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 18
				-
					-
						Be exceeded by the number of aeons
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 19
				-
					-
						Since that Buddha has passed into extinction;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 20
				-
					-
						It has been limitless aeons such as this.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 21
				-
					-
						The Thus Come One, with unobstructed wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 22
				-
					-
						Knows of that Buddha's extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 23
				-
					-
						And of his Sound Hearers and Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 24
				-
					-
						As if seeing his extinction now.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 25
				-
					-
						Bhikshus, you should know
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 26
				-
					-
						The Buddha's wisdom is pure, subtle, and wondrous;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 27
				-
					-
						Without outflows and without obstructions
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 6: Line 28
				-
					-
						It penetrates limitless aeons.
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 7
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bhikshus, "the Buddha Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory had
					a life-span of five hundred forty myriads of millions of Nayutas of aeons."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 8
			-
				-
					When this Buddha was seated on the Bodhimanda, having destroyed the troops of
					Mara, although he was on the point of attaining Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, still
					the Buddhadharmas did not appear before him. So it was for one minor aeon and
					then onwards to ten minor aeons that he sat in the lotus posture, body and mind
					unmoving, and yet the Buddhadharmas still did not appear before him. Thereupon,
					the gods of the Triyastrimsha Heaven, spread out for the Buddha, under a Bodhi
					tree, a lion throne one Yojana in height; on that throne the Buddha was to
					attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Just as he sat down upon that throne, the kings
					of the Brahma Heavens rained down heavenly flowers over a distance of one
					hundred Yojanas. A fragrant wind from time to time swept away the withered
					flowers as fresh ones rained down. This continued without interruption for a
					full ten minor aeons as an offering to the Buddha, the rain of these flowers
					continuing right up until his extinction. In the same way the gods of the four
					heavenly kings constantly played heavenly drums as an offering to that Buddha
					and the other gods made heavenly instrumental music for a full ten minor aeons,
					right up until his extinction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Bhikshus, the Buddha Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory passed through ten minor
					aeons before the Buddhadharmas finally manifested before him and he attained
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Before that Buddha left home he had sixteen sons, the first of whom was named
					Accumulation of Knowledge. Each of them had a variety of precious, unusual fine
					toys. When they heard that their father had realized Anuttarasamyaksambodhi
					they all cast aside these things they valued and went before the Buddha,
					escorted by their weeping mothers. Their grandfather, a Wheel Turning Sage
					King, together with a hundred great ministers and with hundreds of thousands of
					myriads of millions of citizens all surrounded them and accompanied them to the
					Bodhimanda, all wishing to draw near to the Thus Come One Great Penetrating
					Wisdom Victory, to make offerings to him, to honor, revere and praise him. When
					they arrived, they bowed with their head at his feet, and having
					circumambulated him, they single-mindedly joined their palms, respectively
					gazed upwards at the World Honored One, and uttered these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 1
				-
					-
						World Honored One of great and awesome virtue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 2
				-
					-
						For the sake of crossing over living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 3
				-
					-
						After limitless millions of aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 4
				-
					-
						You accomplished Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 5
				-
					-
						And perfected all your vows;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 6
				-
					-
						Unsurpassed is our good fortune.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 7
				-
					-
						Very rare you are, World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 8
				-
					-
						In one sitting, passing through ten minor aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 9
				-
					-
						With body, hands and feet,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 10
				-
					-
						Still, secure, and unmoving.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 11
				-
					-
						Your mind, ever tranquil,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 12
				-
					-
						Never knows distraction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 13
				-
					-
						Ultimate, your eternal extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 14
				-
					-
						As you dwell firmly in the non-outflow Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 15
				-
					-
						Now we see the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 16
				-
					-
						Serenely realize the Buddha Path;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 17
				-
					-
						We all gain good benefit
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 18
				-
					-
						And proclaim our delight and great joy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 19
				-
					-
						Living beings, ever tormented by suffering,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 20
				-
					-
						Blind, and without a guide,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 21
				-
					-
						Fail to recognize the path which ends that pain,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 22
				-
					-
						And do not know to seek their liberation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 23
				-
					-
						During the long night the evil destinies increase,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 24
				-
					-
						While the hosts of gods are reduced in number;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 25
				-
					-
						From darkness they proceed into darkness,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 26
				-
					-
						Never hearing the Buddha's name.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 27
				-
					-
						Now, the Buddha's gained the utmost
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 28
				-
					-
						Peace, rest, the non-outflow way;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 29
				-
					-
						And we, and all of the gods,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 30
				-
					-
						To attain the greatest benefit
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 31
				-
					-
						Therefore bow our heads
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 10: Line 32
				-
					-
						And return our lives to the Unsurpassed Honored One.
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 11
			-
				-
					When the sixteen sons had finished praising the Buddha, they then entreated him
					to turn the Dharma wheel, saying, "World Honored One, speak the Dharma and
					bring us peace show us pity, and benefit both gods and humans." Then they spoke
					more verses saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 1
				-
					-
						"O Hero of the World, incomparable
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 2

						Adorned with a hundred blessings,

						Pray speak for the sake of this world

					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 7
				-
					-
						Demonstrate it: speak it in detail

					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 8
				-
					-
						and lead us to attain that wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 9
				-
					-
						For, if we can attain Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 10
				-
					-
						Other living beings can do the same.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 11
				-
					-
						The World Honored One knows the profound thoughts

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 12
				-
					-
						Within the minds of living beings;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 13

					-
						He knows the ways on which they walk

						And the strength of their wisdom,

					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 15
				-
					-
						The pleasures and the blessings they have cultivated,

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 16

						And all the deeds done in former lives.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 17
				-
					-
						The World Honored One, knowing all of this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 11: Line 18
				-
					-
						Should turn the unsurpassed wheel!"
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 12
			-
				-
					The Buddha, Shakyamuni, told the Bhikshus, "When the Buddha
					Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory attained Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, in each of
					the ten directions, five hundred myriads of millions of Buddha worlds quaked in
					six ways. The dark recesses between those lands that the awesome light of the
					sun and moon could not illumine then were brightly lit, and the living beings
					therein were able to see one another. They all said 'where have all these
					living beings come from?' Further, in those lands, all the heavenly palaces, up
					to the Brahma palaces, quaked in six ways. A great light shone everywhere,
					illumining the entire universe and surpassing the light of the heavens."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 13
			-
				-
					At that time, in five hundred myriads of millions of lands to the east, the
					Brahma Heaven palaces shone with a light twice that of their usual brightness.
					Each of the Brahma Heaven Kings had this thought, "now the palaces are brighter
					than ever before. What is the reason for this manifestation?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 14
			-
				-
					Then, the Brahma Heaven Kings visited one another and discussed this matter. In
					the assembly there was one great Brahma Heaven King by the name of Rescuing
					All, who on behalf of the Brahma hosts spoke verses, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 1
				-
					-
						All of our palaces
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 2
				-
					-
						Are bright as never before;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 3
				-
					-
						What is the reason for this?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 4
				-
					-
						Let us seek it together.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 5
				-
					-
						Is it because a great and virtuous god had been born?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 6
				-
					-
						Or because a Buddha has appeared in the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 7
				-
					-
						That this great light
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 14: Line 8
				-
					-
						Shines throughout the ten directions?
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time, the Brahma Heaven Kings from five hundred myriads of millions of
					lands, together with their palaces, each with sacks filled with heavenly
					flowers, went to the west to seek out this manifestation. They saw the Thus
					Come One Great-Penetrating-Wisdom Victory seated on the lion throne beneath the
					Bodhi tree in the Bodhimanda, revered and circumambulated by gods, dragon
					kings, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, and beings both human and non-human.
					They saw as well the sixteen sons of the king requesting the Buddha to turn the
					Dharma Wheel.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Then, the Brahma Heaven Kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet,
					circumambulated him a hundred thousand times, and scattered heavenly flowers
					upon him. The flowers were piled as high as Mount Sumeru, and they offered them
					as well to the Buddha's Bodhi tree, which was ten Yojanas in height. Having
					made offerings of flowers, each presented his palace to the Buddha, saying,
					'pray show us pity, and benefit us by accepting and occupying these palaces
					that we offer you!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Then the Brahma Heaven Kings, in front of the Buddha, with a single mind and
					the same voice, spoke verses in praise, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 1
				-
					-
						"World Honored One, you are very rare,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 2
				-
					-
						And difficult to encounter;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 3
				-
					-
						Complete with limitless meritorious virtues,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 4
				-
					-
						You are able to rescue and protect all creatures.

				-
					-
						Great teacher of gods and humans,

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 6
				-
					-
						You who pity all the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 7
				-
					-
						All beings in the ten directions
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 8
				-
					-
						Receive your beneficence.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 9
				-
					-
						We have come from

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 10
				-
					-
						Five hundred myriads of millions of lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 11
				-
					-
						Setting aside the bliss of deep Dhyana samadhi,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 12
				-
					-
						For the sake of making offerings ot the Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 13
				-
					-
						Blessings we've gained in former lives
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 14
				-
					-
						Well ornament our palaces.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 15
				-
					-
						Now we offer them to the World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 17: Line 16
				-
					-
						Only praying you will show mercy and accept them.
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time, the Brahma Heaven Kings, having praised the Buddha, said "We only
					pray that the World Honored One will turn the Dharma wheel, crossing over
					living beings, opening up the way to Nirvana." Then; all the Brahma Heaven
					Kings with one mind and the same voice, proclaimed these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						"Hero of the World, doubly perfect honored one,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						We only pray that you will expound and proclaim the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						And through the power of your great compassion and pity
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						Cross over suffering and tormented living beings.
					-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Thereupon, the Thus Come One Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory, assented by his
					silence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Furthermore, O Bhikshus, to the southeast the great Brahma Kings in five
					hundred myriads of millions of lands, seeing their palaces in dazzling
					brilliance as never before, jumped for joy, thinking it rare indeed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 21
			-
				-
					They visited one another and discussed this matter. Then, in the assembly, a
					Brahma Heaven King by the name of Great Compassion, on behalf of the Brahma
					hosts spoke these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 1
				-
					-
						"What is the reason for this event?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 2
				-
					-
						Whey has this sign appeared?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 3
				-
					-
						All of our palaces
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 4
				-
					-
						Are aglow as never before.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 5
				-
					-
						Has a greatly virtuous god been born?

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 6
				-
					-
						Or has a Buddha appeared in the world?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 7
				-
					-
						We have never seen such signs before.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 8
				-
					-
						With one mind we should investigate it,

				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 21: Line 9

					Then the Brahma Heaven kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet,

					Then, the Brahma Heaven Kings, with one mind and a single voice, spoke verses

					twelve parts which cannot be turned by Shramanas, Brahmans, Gods, Maras,
					Brahmas, or other beings of the world. He said, "This is suffering. This is the
					origination of suffering. This is the extinction of suffering. This the way to

					And he extensively set forth the Dharma of the twelve causes and conditions:

					organs. The six sense organs condition contact. Contact conditions feeling.
					Feeling conditions craving. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions
					becoming. Becoming conditions birth. Birth conditions old age and death, worry,
					grief, suffering and distress. When ignorance is extinguished, dispositions are
					extinguished. When dispositions are extinguished, then consciousness is
					extinguished. When consciousness is extinguished, then name and form are
					extinguished. When name and form are extinguished, then the six sense organs
					are extinguished, then contact is extinguished. When contact is extinguished,

					extinguished. When craving is extinguished, then grasping is extinguished. When
					grasping is extinguished, then becoming is extinguished. When becoming is
					extinguished, then birth is extinguished. When birth is extinguished, then old

					When the Buddha spoke this Dharma, amidst the great assembly of gods and

					did not grasp at any Dharmas, had their minds liberated from all outflows. All
					attained profound and subtle Dhyana concentration, the Three Clarities, the Six
					Penetrations, and perfected the Eight Liberations. The second, third, and
					fourth times he set forth this Dharma, thousands of millions of Nayutas of
					living beings, their numbers like the Ganges' sand, also because they did not
					grasp at any Dharmas, had their minds liberated from outflows. From that time
					onwards, the assembly of Sound Hearers was unlimited, boundless, and
					unreckonable.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 43
			-
				-
					At that time the sixteen princes all left home as virgin youths and became
					Shramaneras. They all possessed sharp faculties and clear wisdom. They had

					Buddhas, purely cultivating Brahman conduct, seeking Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 44
			-
				-
					They all spoke to the Buddha, saying, "World Honored One, all these limitless
					thousands of myriads of millions of greatly virtuous Sound Hearers already have
					reached accomplishment. World Honored One, you should, for our sakes, also,
					speak the Dharma of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Having heard it, we will all
					cultivate and study it. World Honored One, we all aspire to the Thus Come One's
					knowledge and vision. As to the thoughts deep within our minds, the Buddha
					himself knows."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 45
			-
				-
					Then, the multitudes, led by the Wheel Turning Sage King, eighty thousand

				Chapter 7: Verse 46
			-
				-
					At that time, the Buddha, having received the request of the sixteen
					Shramaneras, after twenty thousand aeons, then at last, amidst the four-fold
					assembly, spoke the Great Vehicle sutra by the name of the Wonderful Dharma
					Lotus Flower, a Dharma for instructing Bodhisattvas of whom the Buddha is
					protective and mindful. After he spoke the Sutra, the sixteen Shramaneras, for
					the sake of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, all received, upheld and recited it and
					keenly penetrated its meaning.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 47
			-
				-
					When the Sutra was spoken, the sixteen Bodhisattva Shramaneras all received it
					with faith. Among the host of Sound Hearers, too, there were those who had
					faith in it and understood it. The remaining thousands of myriads of millions
					of living beings, however, all gave rise to doubts.
				-

					The Buddha spoke this Sutra for eighty thousand aeons without cessation.

					Then the sixteen Bodhisattva Shramaneras, knowing that the Buddha had entered
					his room and was silently absorbed in Dhyana Samadhi, each ascended the Dharma
					seat. For a period of eighty-four thousand aeons, for the sake of the four-fold
					assembly, they spoke the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra extensively and in
					detail. Each one of them crossed over six hundred myriads of millions of
					Nayutas of Ganges' sands of living beings, instructing them with the teaching,
					benefitting them, making them rejoice and causing them to bring forth the
					thought of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 51
			-
				-
					After eighty-four thousand aeons had passed, the Buddha
					Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory arose from Samadhi, approached the Dharma
					throne and serenely sat down upon it. He addressed the great assembly, saying,
					"These sixteen Bodhisattva Shramaneras are very rare. All their faculties are
					keen and their wisdom is clear. They have in the past already made offerings to
					limitless thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas. In the presence of those
					Buddhas, they constantly cultivated Brahman conduct, accepting and upholding
					the Buddha's wisdom, instructing living beings and causing them to enter into
					it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 52
			-
				-
					"You should all make a point of drawing near to and making offerings to them.
					Why? Those Sound Hearers, Pratyeka Buddhas, or Bodhisattvas who can have faith
					in the Dharma of the Sutra spoken by these sixteen Bodhisattvas, accept and
					uphold it without defaming it, will all attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, that is,
					the wisdom of the Thus Come One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 53
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bhikshus, "These sixteen Bodhisattvas always delight in
					speaking the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra. Each Bodhisattva has
					transformed six hundred myriads of millions of Nayutas of Ganges' sands of
					living beings who, life after life were born together with the Bodhisattvas and
					heard the Dharma from them, fully believing and understanding it. For this
					reason, they have met up with forty thousand millions of Buddhas, World Honored
					Ones and to this moment have not stopped doing so.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 54
			-
				-
					"Bhikshus, I will tell you, those disciples of the Buddha, the sixteen
					Shramaneras, have all now attained Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, and in the lands of
					the ten directions, are presently speaking the Dharma. They have as their
					retinues limitless hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattvas and Sound
					Hearers. Two have become Buddhas in the East: One is named Akshobhya, in the
					Land of Happiness. The other is named Sumeru Peak. Two have become Buddhas in
					the Southeast: One is named Lion Sound. The other is named Lion Sign. Two have
					become Buddhas in the South: One is named Space Dweller. The other is named
					Eternal Extinction. Two have become Buddhas in the Southwest: One is named
					Royal Sign. The other is named Brahma Sign. Two have become Buddhas in the
					West: One is named Amitayus. The other is named Savior of all Worlds from
					Suffering and Anguish. Two have become Buddhas in the Northwest. One is named
					Tamalapa-trachandana Fragrance and Spiritual Penetrations. The other is named
					Sumeru Sign. Two have become Buddhas in the North. One is named Cloud
					Self-Mastery. The other is named King of Cloud Self-Mastery. In the Northeast
					there is a Buddha by the name of Destroyer of All Worldly Fear. The other
					Buddha, the sixteenth, is myself, Shakyamuni Buddha, here in the Saha World,
					where I have realized Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 55
			-
				-
					"Bhikshus, we, are Shramaneras each taught and transformed limitless hundreds
					of thousands of myriads of millions of Ganges' sands of living beings, who,
					hearing the Dharma from us, were set towards Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 56
			-
				-
					"Of these living beings, there are those who dwell at the level of Sound
					Hearers. I constantly instruct and transform them in Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
					All these people will, by means of this Dharma, gradually enter the Buddha
					Path. Why? The Thus Come One's wisdom is hard to believe and hard to
					understand.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 57
			-
				-
					"The living beings, limitless as Ganges' sands, who I transformed at that time
					are you, yourselves, Bhikshus, and are also those who will be Sound Hearer
					disciples in the future, after my extinction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 58
			-
				-
					"After my extinction, furthermore, there will be disciples who will not hear
					this Sutra, who will not know or be aware of the Bodhisattva conduct, but who
					will through the attainment of their own merit and virtue give rise to the
					thought of extinction and who will enter Nirvana. I shall be a Buddha in
					another land, with another name. Although these people will have produced the
					thought of extinction and enter into Nirvana, they will, in those lands, seek
					the Buddha's wisdom and get to hear this Sutra and that it is only by means of
					the Buddha-vehicle that extinction can be attained. There are no other
					vehicles, except for those expedient devices taught by other Thus Come Ones.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 59
			-
				-
					"Bhikshus, when the Thus Come One knows of himself, that the time of his
					Nirvana has come, that the assembly is pure, that their faith and understanding
					are solid and firm, that they fully comprehend the Dharma emptiness and have
					deeply entered into Dhyana Samadhi, he will gather together the host of
					Bodhisattvas and Sound Hearers and speak this Sutra for them, saying, 'there
					are not two vehicles by which extinction is attained. There is only the One
					Buddha Vehicle by which extinction can be attained.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 60
			-
				-
					"Bhikshus, you should know, the expedients of the Thus Come deeply enter the
					natures of living beings. Knowing that they aspire to and are content with
					lesser Dharmas and are deeply attached to the Five Desires, he speaks to them
					of Nirvana. When they hear him, then they immediately believe and accept it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 61
			-
				-
					"It is as if, for example, there is a road, five hundred Yojanas long, steep
					dangerous and bad, an uninhabited and terrifying place. A large group of people
					wish to travel this road to reach a cache of precious jewels. Among them, there
					is a guide, intelligent, wise and clear-headed, who knows the road well, both
					its passable and impassable features. And who wishes to lead the group through
					this hardship.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 62
			-
				-
					"Midway, the group he is leading grows weary and wishes to turn back. They say
					to the guide, 'We are exhausted and afraid. We cannot go forward. Its too far.
					We want to turn back now.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 63
			-
				-
					"Their leader, who has many expedients, has this thought; 'How pitiful they
					are. How can they renounce the great and precious treasure and wish to turn
					back?' Having had this thought, through the power of his expedient devices, he
					transforms a city in the center of the dangerous road, three hundred Yojanas in
					extent, and says to them, 'Do not be afraid. Do not turn back; stay here now in
					this great city I have created just for you. If you go into this city, you will
					be happy and at peace. If you then wish to proceed to the jewel cache, you may
					do so.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 64
			-
				-
					"Then the exhausted group rejoiced greatly, having gained what they had never
					had. 'We have now escaped this bad road and gained happiness and peace.' Then
					the group went forward and entered the transformed city; thinking that they had
					already been saved, they felt happy and at peace.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 65
			-
				-
					"At that time, the guide, knowing that they were rested and no longer weary,
					made the city disappear, saying to them, 'All of you, come, let us go. The
					jewel cache is near. The great city was merely something I created from
					transformation to give you a rest.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 66
			-
				-
					"Bhikshus, the Thus Come One is also like this. He now acts as a great guide
					for all of you. He knows that living beings should leave and cross over the
					evil road of the torments of birth and death which is so steep, difficult and
					long.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 67
			-
				-
					If living beings only hear of the One Buddha Vehicle, they will not wish to see
					the Buddha or to draw near to him. Instead, they will think, 'the Buddha path
					is long and far; it can only be accomplished after much labor and suffering.'
					The Buddha knows their minds to be weak and lowly. When they are half-way
					there, he uses the power of expedients to speak of the two Nirvanas in order to
					give them a rest. If living beings dwell on these two levels, the Thus Come One
					then tells them, 'You have not yet finished your job. The level you are
					dwelling at is near the Buddhas' wisdom. You should observe and ponder this:
					the Nirvana you have attained is not the real one. The Thus Come One has but
					used the power of his expedients and, within the One Buddha Vehicle,
					discriminated and spoken of three.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 7: Verse 68
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 1
				-
					-
						The Buddha Great-Penetrating-Wisdom-Victory
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 2
				-
					-
						Sat in the Bodhimanda for ten aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 3
				-
					-
						Without the manifestation of the Buddha Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 4
				-
					-
						And he did not realize the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 5
				-
					-
						Heavenly spirits and Dragon Kings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 6
				-
					-
						And the host of Asuras,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 7
				-
					-
						Consantly rained down heavenly flowers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 8
				-
					-
						As an offering to that Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 9
				-
					-
						The Gods beat upon their heavenly drums
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 10
				-
					-
						And made all kinds of music;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 11
				-
					-
						Fragrant breezes blew away the withered flowers
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 12
				-
					-
						And fine, new ones rained down.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 13
				-
					-
						When ten aeons had passed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 14
				-
					-
						He then realized the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 15
				-
					-
						All the gods and humans,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 16
				-
					-
						Danced for the joy within their minds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 17
				-
					-
						The sixteen sons of that Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 18
				-
					-
						As well as their retinues,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 19
				-
					-
						Thousands of millions surrounding them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 20
				-
					-
						All went before that Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 21
				-
					-
						They bowed with their heads at his feet
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 22
				-
					-
						"May the sagely lion's Dharma rain
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 23
				-
					-
						Fill us and everyone!"
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 24
				-
					-
						A World Honored One is very hard to encounter,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 25
				-
					-
						Appearing but once in a long time.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 26
				-
					-
						In order to awaken all creatures,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 27
				-
					-
						He shakes all things.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 28
				-
					-
						In five hundred myriads of millions of lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 29
				-
					-
						In worlds in the eastern direction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 30
				-
					-
						Brahma palaces shone with a light
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 31
				-
					-
						Such as they never had before.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 32
				-
					-
						The Brahmas, seeing these signs,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 33
				-
					-
						Followed them to the Buddha;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 34
				-
					-
						They scattered flowers as an offering,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 35
				-
					-
						And offered up their palaces,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 36
				-
					-
						Asking the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 37
				-
					-
						With verses in his praise.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 38
				-
					-
						The Buddha knew the time had not yet come
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 39
				-
					-
						And received their request seated in silence.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 40
				-
					-
						From the other three directions, and four points between,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 41
				-
					-
						And, likewise, from above, and below,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 42
				-
					-
						They scattered flowers and offered their palaces,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 43
				-
					-
						Asking the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel:
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 44
				-
					-
						"The World Honored One is very hard to meet;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 45
				-
					-
						We pray that through his great compassion and pity.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 46
				-
					-
						He will open wide the sweet dew door
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 47
				-
					-
						And turn the supreme Dharma wheel."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 48
				-
					-
						The World Honored One, having limitless wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 49
				-
					-
						Received the multitude's request
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 50
				-
					-
						And proclaimed various Dharmas for their sakes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 51
				-
					-
						The Four Turths, the Twelve Conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 52
				-
					-
						From ignorance up to old age and death -
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 53
				-
					-
						All arise because of birth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 54
				-
					-
						In this way the host of calamities comes to be;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 55
				-
					-
						You should all know this.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 56
				-
					-
						When he expounded on this Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 57
				-
					-
						Six hundred myriads of millions of billions
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 58
				-
					-
						Exhausted the limits of all suffering
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 59
				-
					-
						And all became Arhats.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 60
				-
					-
						When he spoke the Dharma the second time,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 61
				-
					-
						Hosts like the sands of a thousand myriads of Ganges Rivers
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 62
				-
					-
						Their minds grasping no Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 63
				-
					-
						Also attained Arhatship.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 64
				-
					-
						After that, those who gained the Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 65
				-
					-
						Were incalculable in number;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 66
				-
					-
						Were one to count through myriads of milions of aeons.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 67
				-
					-
						One could not reach their limit.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 68
				-
					-
						At that time, the sixteen princes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 69
				-
					-
						Left home and became Shramaneras.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 70
				-
					-
						Together they requested that the Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 71
				-
					-
						Extensively proclaim the Dharma of the Great Vehicle:
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 72
				-
					-
						"May we and our followers
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 73
				-
					-
						All perfect the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 74
				-
					-
						We wish to become like the World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 75
				-
					-
						With the wisdom eye and foremost purity."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 76
				-
					-
						The Buddha, knowing the intentions of the youths,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 77
				-
					-
						Their practices in former lives,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 78
				-
					-
						Used limitless causes and conditions
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 79
				-
					-
						And various analogies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 80
				-
					-
						To teach them the Six Paramitas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 81
				-
					-
						As well as matters of spiritual penetrations.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 82
				-
					-
						He discriminated the real Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 83
				-
					-
						And the pathway walked by the Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 84
				-
					-
						He spoke The Dharma Flower Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 85
				-
					-
						Its verses in numbers like Gange's sands.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 86
				-
					-
						After that Buddha had spoken the Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 87
				-
					-
						In a quiet room he entered Dyhana Samadhi
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 88
				-
					-
						Single-mindedly sitting in one place,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 89
				-
					-
						For eighty-four thousand aeons.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 90
				-
					-
						All the Shramaneras,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 91
				-
					-
						Knowing the Buddha had not yet left Dhyana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 92
				-
					-
						For the sake of the limitless millions assembled,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 93
				-
					-
						Spoke of the Buddha's unsurpassed wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 94
				-
					-
						Each seated on his Dharma throne,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 95
				-
					-
						Spoke this Great Vehicle Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 96
				-
					-
						After the Buddha had become peacefully still,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 97
				-
					-
						They propagated and taught the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 98
				-
					-
						Each one of the Shramaneras
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 99
				-
					-
						Took across living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 100
				-
					-
						To the number of grains of sand
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 101
				-
					-
						In six hundred myriads of Ganges rivers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 102
				-
					-
						After that Buddha had crossed over into extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 103
				-
					-
						All those who heard the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 104
				-
					-
						In whatever Buddhalands they might be,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 105
				-
					-
						Were reborn there together with their teachers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 106
				-
					-
						The sixteen Shramaneras
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 107
				-
					-
						Perfectly practiced the Buddha Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 108
				-
					-
						Presently in the ten directions
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 109
				-
					-
						Each has realized proper enlightenment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 110
				-
					-
						Those who heard the Dharma then,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 111
				-
					-
						Are each in the presence of a Buddha;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 112
				-
					-
						Those who are Sound Hearers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 113
				-
					-
						Are gradually taught the Buddha Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 114
				-
					-
						I was one of the sixteen;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 115
				-
					-
						In the past, I taught all of you.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 116
				-
					-
						I therefore use expedients
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 117
				-
					-
						To draw you into the Buddha's wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 118
				-
					-
						Through these former causal conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 119
				-
					-
						I presently speak The Dharma Flower Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 120
				-
					-
						Leading you to enter the Buddha Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 121
				-
					-
						Take care not to become frightened.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 122
				-
					-
						Suppose there is a steep and bad road,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 123
				-
					-
						Remote and teeming with venomous beasts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 124
				-
					-
						Lacking, as well as, water or grass
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 125
				-
					-
						- A place feared by all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 126
				-

						Countless thousands of myriads
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 127

						Wish to traverse this dangerous road
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 128
				-
					-
						With its pathways so distant,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 129
				-
					-
						Extending five hundred Yojanas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 130
				-
					-
						There is among them a guide,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 131
				-
					-
						Intelligent and wise,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 132
				-
					-
						Clear and resolute in mind,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 133
				-
					-
						Who can rescue them from their difficulty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 134
				-
					-
						The group grows weary
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 135
				-
					-
						And says to the guide,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 136
				-
					-
						"We are all exhausted, now
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 137
				-
					-
						And want to turn back."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 138
				-
					-
						The guide thinks to himself,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 139
				-
					-
						"How very pitiful they are.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 140
				-
					-
						How can they wish to turn back
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 141
				-
					-
						and lose the great and precious treasure?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 142
				-
					-
						Instantly he thinks of a device:
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 143
				-
					-
						Using the power of spiritual penetrations
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 144
				-
					-
						He conjures up a great city
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 145
				-
					-
						Adorned with houses,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 146
				-
					-
						Surrounded by gardens and groves,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 147
				-
					-
						Brooks and bathing ponds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 148
				-
					-
						Layered gates and tiered pavilions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 149
				-
					-
						Filled with men and women.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 150
				-
					-
						After creating this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 151
				-
					-
						He pities them saying, "Do not be afraid.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 152
				-
					-
						But go into this city
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 153
				-
					-
						And enjoy yourselves as you wish."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 154
				-
					-
						When they had entered the city,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 155
				-
					-
						They rejoiced greatly at heart
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 156
				-
					-
						Thinking they were safe and sound,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 157
				-
					-
						And that they had been saved.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 158
				-
					-
						The guide, knowing they were rested,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 159
				-
					-
						Assembled them together and said,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 160
				-
					-
						"You should all go forward,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 161
				-
					-
						For this is nothing but a transformed city.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 162
				-
					-
						Seeing that you were exhausted
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 163
				-
					-
						And wanted to turn back midway,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 164
				-
					-
						I used the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 165
				-
					-
						To transform provisionally this city.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 166
				-
					-
						You should now be vigorous
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 167
				-
					-
						And proceed to the jewel cache."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 168
				-
					-
						I, too, am like this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 169
				-
					-
						I am the guide of all;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 170
				-
					-
						Seeing those who seek the way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 171
				-
					-
						Exhausted in mid-course
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 172
				-
					-
						Unable to cross the dangerous paths,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 173
				-
					-
						Of birth, death and affliction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 174
				-
					-
						Therefore, I use the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 175
				-
					-
						To speak of Nirvana and give them a rest,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 176
				-
					-
						Saying, "Your sufferings are ended.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 177
				-
					-
						You have done what you had to do.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 178
				-
					-
						Then, knowing they have reached Nirvana,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 179
				-
					-
						And had all become Arhats,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 180
				-
					-
						I gather them together,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 181
				-
					-
						To teach them the genuine Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 182
				-
					-
						The Buddhas use the power of expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 183
				-
					-
						To discriminate and speak of Three Vehicles
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 184
				-
					-
						But there is only the One Buddha Vehicle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 185
				-
					-
						The other two were spoken as a resting place.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 186
				-
					-
						What I am telling you now is the truth;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 187
				-
					-
						What you have gained is not extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 188
				-
					-
						For the sake of the Buddha's all wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 189
				-
					-
						You should exert yourselves with great vigor.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 190
				-
					-
						When you have certified to all wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 191
				-
					-
						And have the Ten Powers and other Buddha Dharmas
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 192
				-
					-
						And have perfected the Thirty-two Marks,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 193
				-
					-
						Then that is genuine extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 194
				-
					-
						The Buddhas, the guiding masters,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 195
				-
					-
						Speak of Nirvana to give living beings rest,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 196
				-
					-
						But once they know that they are rested,
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 197
				-
					-
						They lead them into the Buddhas' wisdom.

				-
					-
						The disciples receive the (Buddha's) kindness;
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Verse 68: Line 201

						But the transformed city is falsely created and is not real.

				Chapter 8: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time Purnamaitreyaniputra, having heard about wisdom and the expedients
					from the Buddha who speaks of Dharma in accord with what is appropriate, having
					heard all the great disciples receive predictions of Annuttarasamyaksambodhi,
					and in addition having heard of the matters of causes and conditions of former
					lives, and furthermore, having heard of the Buddha's great comfort and the
					power of his spiritual penetrations obtained what he had never had. His mind
					was purified and he rejoiced.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Thereupon, he rose from his seat, bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet, and
					withdrew to one side, gazing unblinkingly at the honored one's countenance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 3
			-
				-
					He then thought, "the World Honored One is most unique. His deeds are rare. He
					accords with all the various dispositions of beings in the world; employing
					expedient devices with knowledge and vision, he speaks the Dharma for them,
					releasing them from various types of greed and attachment. We could never fully
					express in words the merit and virtue of the Buddha. Only the Buddha, the World
					Honored One can know our deepest thoughts and past vows."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 4
			-
				-
					At that time, the Buddha told the Bhikshus, "Do you see this
					Purnamaitreyaniputra? I constantly praise him as being foremost of those who
					speak the Dharma, and I extol his various meritorious qualities, his vigorous
					and diligent support in helping to proclaim my Dharma. In the midst of the
					four-fold assembly, he can demonstrate the teaching to the delight and
					advantage of all. He perfectly interprets the Proper Dharma of the Buddha,
					greatly benefitting his fellow practitioners of Brahman conduct. Except for the
					Thus Come One, no one can fully appreciate his eloquence in discussion.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"You should not say that Purnamaitreyaniputra is only able to protect, support,
					and help propagate my Dharma alone. He has also, in the presence of ninety
					million Buddhas of the past, protected, supported, and helped to propagate
					those Buddhas' Proper Dharma, being foremost among the speakers of Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Further, he has thoroughly understood the Dharma of emptiness taught by those
					Buddhas, and gained the Four Unobstructed Wisdoms. He is always able to speak
					the Dharma, purely and precisely, without doubts. He has perfected the power of
					the Bodhisattva's spiritual penetrations. Throughout his entire life, he has
					cultivated Brahman conduct. The Buddhas' contemporaries all spoke of him as
					actually a Sound Hearer, but this was just an expedient device he used in order
					to benefit limitless hundreds of thousands of living beings. He further
					transformed limitless Asankhyeyas of people, causing them to stand in
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.. In order to purify the Buddhalands, he constantly
					performs the Buddha's work in teaching and transforming living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"O Bhikshus, Purnamaitreyaniputra has been the foremost speaker of the Dharma
					for the past seven Buddhas, and he is also foremost speaker of Dharma under me.
					He will also be the foremost speaker of Dharma under all the Buddhas to come in
					the worthy Kalpa, for whom he will protect, uphold and help in propagating the
					Buddhadharma. He shall also protect, uphold and help the Dharma of limitless,
					boundless numbers of future Buddhas, teaching, transforming and benefitting
					limitless living beings, causing them to stand in Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. In
					order to purify the Buddhalands, he will be ever vigorous and diligent in
					teaching and transforming living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"He will gradually perfect the Bodhisattva Path, and after limitless Asankhyeya
					aeons he will in this land attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. His name will be
					Dharma-Brightness-Thus-Come-One, one Worthy of Offerings, one of Proper and
					Universal Knowledge, one of Perfect Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone one who
					Understands the World, Supreme Lord, A Hero Who Subdues and Tames, A Teacher of
					Gods and Humans, The Buddha, The World Honored One.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"This Buddha shall take great trichiliocosms as many as the sands in the Ganges
					river as his Buddhaland, with the seven jewels for earth. The land will be as
					level as the palm of one's hand. It shall have no mountains, or hills, gorges,
					gullys or ditches. It will be filled with pavilions and palaces of the seven
					jewels. The palaces of the gods will be located in space nearby so the humans
					and gods may consort and see one another.

			-
				-
					"There will be no evil paths and no women. All the living beings will be born

				Chapter 8: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"They will obtain great spiritual penetrations. Their bodies will emit light,
					and they will be able to fly at will. Their resolve will be solid. They will be
					vigorous and wise. They all will be golden colored, and adorned with the
					Thirty-two Marks. The living beings in that land will always take two kinds of
					food: The first, the food of Dharma-joy and the second, the food of
					Dhyana-happiness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"The host of Bodhisattvas will number in the limitless Asankhyeyas of thousands
					of myriads of millions of Nayutas. They will attain great spiritual
					penetrations and the Four Unobstructed Wisdoms, they will be skilled at
					teaching and transforming all kinds of living beings. The host of Sound Hearers
					will be uncountable and unreckonable in number. All will perfect the Six
					Penetrations, the Three Clarities and the Eight Liberations.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"The realization of this Buddhaland will be thus adorned with limitless

			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke

				-
					-
						All of you Bhikshus listen well,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 2
				-
					-
						The path walked by the Buddha's sons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 3
				-
					-
						Because they thoroughly stuided the expedient devices,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 4
				-
					-
						Was inconceivable.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 5
				-
					-
						Knowing that the multitudes delight in lesser Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 6
				-
					-
						And also that they fear great wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 7
				-
					-
						Therefore the Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 8
				-
					-
						Become Sound Hearers and Conditioned Enlightened Ones.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 9
				-
					-
						Employing countless expedient devices,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 10
				-
					-
						They transform all the varieties of living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 11
				-
					-
						They speak of themselves as being Sound Hearers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 12
				-
					-
						Very far from the Path of the Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 13
				-
					-
						They cross over limitless multitudes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 14
				-
					-
						Bringing them all to accomplishment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 15
				-
					-
						Even those of little zeal and who are remiss
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 16
				-
					-
						Are gradually caused to become Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 17
				-
					-
						Inwardly they practice as Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 18
				-
					-
						While outwardly they manifest as Sound Hearers
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 19
				-
					-
						Of few desires, who despise birth and death,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 20
				-
					-
						While in reality they are purifying their Buddhalands.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 21
				-
					-
						Displaying to the multitudes the Three Poisons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 22
				-
					-
						Appearing to have deviant views
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 23
				-
					-
						In this way my disciples,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 24
				-
					-
						Expediently save living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 25
				-
					-
						Were I to speak fully,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 26
				-
					-
						Of their various deeds of transformation
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 27
				-
					-
						Living beings, hearing it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 28
				-
					-
						Would harbor doubts within their minds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 29
				-
					-
						Now, this Purnamaitreyaniputra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 30
				-
					-
						In the past under thousands of millions of Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 31
				-
					-
						Has cultivated diligently his practice of the Path
					-

				-
					-
						In the presence of the Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 35
				-

						He appeared as the head of the disciples.

				-
					-
						With much learning and with wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 37
				-

						He spoke without fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 38
				-
					-
						Leading the assembly to rejoice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 39
				-
					-
						And never did he grow weary,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 40
				-
					-
						Participating in the Buddhas' work.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 41
				-
					-
						Having already crossed over into great spiritual penetrations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 42
				-
					-
						And having perfected the Four Unobstructed Wisdoms,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 43

					-
						And always spoke pure Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 45
				-
					-
						Proclaiming principles such as this,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 46

				-
					-
						To dwell in the Dharma of the Great Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 48
				-
					-

				-
					-
						The host of Bodhisattvas, very great,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 64
				-

						Will entirely fill that land,

						All with great spiritual penetrations,

						And the perfect power of awesome virtue;

						The Sound Hearers also will be countless.

						Having the Three Clarities and the Eight Liberations

						And the Four Unobstructed Wisdoms,

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 71
				-
					-
						They will constitute the Sangha there.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 72
				-
					-
						The living beings in that land,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 73
				-
					-
						Will have all severed sexual desire,

						Born purely from transformation,

						Their bodies adorned with perfect marks.

						Taking Dharma-joy and Dharma-happiness as food,

						They will have no thoughts of other kinds of food.

						The Bhikshu Purna

				-
					-
						Having perfected his virtue
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 82
				-

				-
					-
						With a host of very many worthy sages.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 84
				-

						Such are the limitless things of which
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 17: Line 85
				-
					-
						I have now but spoken in a general way.
					-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time, the twelve hundred Arhats whose minds had attained self-control
					had this thought, "We all rejoice, having attained what we never had before. If
					the World Honored One would see to conferring upon us a prediction as he has
					the other great disciples, would this not be a cause for rejoicing?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 19
			-
				-
					The Buddha, knowing the thoughts in their minds, told Mahakashyapa: "I now
					confer upon these twelve hundred Arhats in succession a prediction of
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 20
			-
				-
					In this assembly, my great disciple, the Bhikshu, Kaundinya, will make
					offerings to sixty-two thousands of millions of Buddhas. Having done so, he
					will then become a Buddha by the name of Universal-Light Thus Come One, one
					Worthy of Offerings, one of Proper and Universal Knowledge, one of Perfect
					Clarity and Conduct, Well-Gone One who Understands the World, Unsurpassed Lord,
					A Taming and Regulating Hero, Teaching of People and Gods, A Buddha, The World
					Honored One.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"The five hundred Arhats, Uruvilvakashyapa, Gayakashyapa, Nadikashyapa,
					Kalodayin, Udayin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphina, Vakula, Cunda, Svagata, and

					Universal-Brightness."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 22
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke
					verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 1
				-
					-
						The Bhikshu Kaundinya,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 2
				-
					-
						Will see limitless Buddhas,

				-
					-
						And after Asankhyeya aeons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 4
				-
					-
						Will realize Equal Proper Enlightenment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 5

						Ever putting forth great light,

						Perfecting all spiritual powers,

						His name will be heard in the ten directions,

						He will always speak the Unsurpassed Path,

						And will therefore be called Universal-Brightness.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 11
				-

						His land will be pure,

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 12
				-
					-
						With courageous and heroic Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 13

						All will mount wonderful towers,

						And roam through the ten direction lands,

						And supreme offerings

				-
					-
						Such are the spiritual powers they will have.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 21
				-
					-
						The lifespan of that Buddha will be sixty-thousand aeons,

					-
						His Proper Dharma will dwell twice that long.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 23

						The Dharma Image Age will be twice the length of that.

						When the Dharma is extinguished, the gods and people will mourn.

				-
					-
						The number of aeons in his lifespan,

				-
					-
						Will be as just stated.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 39
				-
					-
						Kashyapa, you should know
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 40
				-
					-
						About these five hundred who have attained self-control.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 22: Line 41
				-
					-
						As for the remaining Sound Hearers,

				-

						To those not present in this assembly,

				-
					-
						You should expound these matters.

			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 23
			-
				-
					At that time, the five hundred Arhats, having received predictions from the
					Buddha, jumped for joy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 24
			-
				-
					They rose from their seats and went before the Buddha, bowing with their heads
					at his feet. Repenting of their errors, they reproached themselves, saying,
					"World Honored One, we had always thought that we had already gained ultimate
					extinction. Now we know that we were like unknowing ones. Why is this? We
					should have obtained the Thus Come one's wisdom, but were content instead with
					lesser knowledge.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 25
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, it is like a person who goes to a close friend's house,
					gets drunk on wine, and lies down. His friend who is about to go away on
					official business, sews a priceless pearl inside his clothing as a gift, and
					then leaves.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"That person, in a drunken stupor, is not aware of anything. On arising, he
					sets out on his travels and reaches another country, where, for the sake of
					clothing and food, he expends much effort, endures great hardships, and is
					content with whatever little he may get.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 27
			-
				-
					"Later, his close friend happens to meet him again and says, 'Hey man! How can
					you, for the sake of food and clothing, have come to this?'
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 28
			-
				-
					'Long ago, wishing you to gain peace, happiness, and enjoyment of the Five
					Desires, on such and such a day, month, and year I sewed a priceless pearl into
					your clothing. From of old until now, it has been present, but you did not know
					of it. Thus you have toiled and suffered to gain your livelihood. How stupid of
					you.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 29
			-
				-
					'You may now take this jewel, exchange it for what you need, and you will
					always have whatever you wish and be free from want.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"The Buddha is also like this. When he was a Bodhisattva, he taught and
					transformed us, causing us to bring forth the thought of All-Wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 31
			-
				-
					"But, we later completely forgot, and were unknowing and unaware.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"Having attained the way of Arhatship, we said of ourselves that we had gained
					extinction. In the difficulty of maintaining our livelihood, we were content
					with what little we had gained."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"Still, our vows for All Wisdom remain; they have not been lost. Now, the World
					Honored One has caused us to wake up, saying, 'Bhikshus! What you have obtained
					is not ultimate extinction!
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 34
			-
				-
					'For a long time, I have been leading you to plant good roots with the Buddha.
					As an expedient device, I manifested the marks of Nirvana. You said of yourself
					however, that you had actually attained extinction.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 35
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, now at last we know that we are actually Bodhisattvas,
					having obtained a prediction for Annuttarasamyaksambodhi. For this reason we
					rejoice greatly, having gained what we never had before."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8: Verse 36
			-
				-
					At that time, Ajnatakaundinya and the others, wishing to restate this meaning,

				-
					-
						"Hearing the supreme sound

				-
					-
						Of the limitless jewels of the Buddha,

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 8
				-
					-
						We'd gained but a small portion of Nirvana,

				-
					-
						And, like unknowing, senseless people,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 10
				-
					-
						Contented ourselves with that.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 11

						It's like a poor person,

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 12
				-
					-
						Who goes to a close friend's home,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 13
				-
					-
						A very wealthy household,

				-
					-
						Satisfied with what little he may get,

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 24

						He's unaware that within his clothing
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 26
				-
					-
						There is a priceless pearl.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 30
				-

						Shows him the pearl he sewed in his clothing.

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 31
				-
					-
						Seeing the pearl, the poor man's
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 32

				-
					-
						Rich with much wealth
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 34

						We, too, are like this

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 36
				-
					-
						In the long night, the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 37

				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 39
				-
					-
						But, because we lacked wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 40
				-
					-
						We were unaware and did not know,

					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 41
				-
					-
						And, gaining a small portion of Nirvana
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 42
				-
					-
						We were satisfied and sought nothing more.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 43
				-
					-
						Now the Buddha has awakened us,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 44
				-
					-
						Saying this is not really extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 45
				-
					-
						Gaining the Buddha's supreme wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 46
				-
					-
						That is true extinction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 47
				-
					-
						Now, having heard from the Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 48
				-
					-
						Of the matters of predictions and adornments,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 49
				-
					-
						And these predictions having been bestowed in succession,
					-
				-
					Chapter 8: Verse 36: Line 50
				-
					-
						We rejoice in body and in mind.
					-
		-
			Chapter 9
		-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time Ananda and Rahula had this thought, "We have often thought how
					happy we would be if we received predictions!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Then they went before the Buddha, bowed with their heads at his feet, and said,
					"World Honored One, we, too, should have a share in this, for it is only to the
					Thus Come One that we go for refuge."
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"Further, we are seen, known and recognized by the gods, people and Asuras in
					all the worlds. Ananda is always your attendant, protecting and upholding the
					treasury of Dharma. Rahula is the Buddha's son. If the Buddha would see fit to
					bestow upon us a prediction for Annuttarasamyaksambodhi, our wishes would be
					fulfilled and the hopes of the assembly would be satisfied."
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Then, the two thousand Sound Hearer disciples, those who were studying and
					those beyond study, all rose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, and
					went before the Buddha. Singlemindedly they put their palms together and gazed
					at the World Honored One expressing the same wish as Ananda and Rahula. Then
					they withdrew to one side.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 5
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha told Ananda, "You in a future age shall become a Buddha
					by the name of King of Self-control and Penetrations with Wisdom like the
					Mountains and Seas Thus Come One, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and
					Universal Knowledge, One Whose Clarity and Conduct are Complete, Well-Gone One
					who Understands the World, Unsurpassed Lord, A Subduing and Taming Hero,
					Teaching of Gods and People, Buddha, The World Honored One. You shall make
					offerings to sixty-two million Buddhas, protecting and upholding their
					storehouses of Dharma. After that, you shall obtain Annuttarasamyaksambodhi.
					You shall teach and transform twenty-thousand myriads of millions of Gange's
					sands of Bodhisattvas, causing them to accomplish Annuttarasamyaksambodhi. Your
					country shall be called 'Banner of Victory Always Raised'. This land will be
					pure, with lapis lazuli for soil. The Kalpa shall be called 'All-pervasive
					Wonderful Sound'. This Buddha's lifespan shall be limitless thousands of
					myriads of millions of Asankhyeya aeons. Were someone to attempt to reckon it
					through thousands of myriads of millions of limitless Asankhyeya aeons, they
					could not do so. The Proper Dharma shall dwell in the world for twice that
					length of time. The Dharma Image Age shall dwell twice the length of the Proper
					Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Ananda, the merit and virtue of the Buddha King of Self control and
					Penetrations with Wisdom like the Mountains and Seas shall be praised by all
					the Buddhas of the ten directions equal in number to the sands of limitless
					thousands of myriads of millions of Ganges rivers."
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 7
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this principle, spoke
					verses saying:

				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 1
				-
					-
						"Now in the midst of the Sangha, I say,

					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 4
				-
					-
						And afterwards realize Right Enlightenment
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 5

						Called "Banner of Victory Always Raised".

				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 9

						Uncountable in number.

				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 11

						His lifespan shall be limitless in length,

					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 15

					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 16
				-
					-
						And the Dharma Image Age will last twice that again.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 17
				-
					-
						Countless living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 18
				-
					-
						Their number like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 19
				-
					-
						Shall plant the causal condition of the Buddha Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 7: Line 20
				-
					-
						Within this Buddha's Dharma.
					-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 8
			-
				-
					At that time, the eight thousand newly resolved Bodhisattvas within the
					Assembly all had this thought: "We have never heard even great Bodhisattvas
					receive predictions such as this. For what reason have the Sound Hearers
					received such directions?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Then the World Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the
					Bodhisattvas, spoke to them, saying, "Good sons, Ananda and I, in the presence
					of the Buddha Emptiness King, simultaneously brought forth the thought of
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Ananda always took delight in learning, while I was
					always diligent and vigorous. Therefore, I have already realized
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi, and Ananda protects and upholds my Dharma. He will also
					protect the Dharma storehouses of all the Buddhas of the future, teaching,
					transforming and bringing to accomplishment the multitudes of Bodhisattvas.
					Since his past vow was such as this, he has therefore obtained this prediction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 10
			-
				-
					When, Ananda, facing the Buddha, heard this prediction and heard of the
					adornments of his Buddhaland, his wishes were fulfilled, and his heart was
					filled with joy, for he had obtained what he never had before. He immediately
					recollected the Dharma storehouse of limitless thousands of myriads of millions
					of past Buddhas, penetrating them without obstruction, as if he had just heard
					them now. He also recalled his past vow.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 11
			-
				-
					At that time, Ananda spoke these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 1
				-
					-
						The World Honored One is extremely rare,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 2
				-
					-
						Having caused me to remember,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 3
				-
					-
						Limitless Buddhadharmas of the past,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 4
				-
					-
						As if I had but heard them today.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 5
				-
					-
						I now have no further doubts,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 6
				-
					-
						But dwell securely in the Buddha Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 7
				-
					-
						Acting expediently as his attendant,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 11: Line 8
				-
					-
						Protecting and upholding the Buddhas' Dharmas.
					-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 12
			-
				-
					The Buddha then addressed Rahula saying, "You in a future age shall become a
					Buddha by the name of 'One Who Steps Upon Flowers of the Seven Jewels'. Thus
					Come One, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Proper and Universal Knowledge, One
					Whose Clarity and Conduct are Complete, Well Gone One Who Understands the
					World, Supreme Lord, A Subduing and Taming Hero, Teaching of Gods and People, A
					Buddha, The World Honored One. You shall make offerings to Buddhas, Thus Come
					Ones, in number as the dust motes in ten world systems, always acting as the
					eldest son of those Buddhas, just as you are now. "The Buddha Who Steps Upon
					Flowers of the Seven Jewels" shall have an adorned land, and the number of
					aeons of his lifespan, the number of disciples he shall teach, the length of
					the Proper Dharma, and the Dharma Image Age shall be the same as those of the
					Thus Come One King of Self control and Penetrations with Wisdom like Mountains
					and Seas. He shall also be the eldest son of this Buddha and thereafter obtain
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Then, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke these
					verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 1
				-
					-
						"When I was a crown prince,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 2
				-
					-
						Rahula was my eldest son.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 3
				-
					-
						Now I have realized the Buddha Path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 4
				-
					-
						He has received the Dharma and is my Dharma-son.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 5
				-
					-
						In a future age,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 6
				-
					-
						He shall see limitless millions of Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 7
				-
					-
						And be the eldest son of each of them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 8
				-
					-
						Singlemindedly seeking the Buddha Path.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 9
				-
					-
						Rahula's secret practices,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 10
				-
					-
						Only I can know.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 11
				-
					-
						He manifests as my eldest son
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 12
				-
					-
						So manifesting himself to living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 13
				-
					-
						His limitless thousand of myriads of millions
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 14
				-
					-
						Of merits cannot be counted.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 15
				-
					-
						He abides securely in the Buddhadharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 13: Line 16
				-
					-
						And thereby seeks the Supreme Path.
					-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 14
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One saw that those who study and those beyond
					study, two thousand in all, were pliant in mind, quiet and pure, singlemindedly
					contemplating the Buddha. The Buddha spoke to Ananda, saying, "Do you see these
					two thousand who study and are beyond study?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"Yes, I have seen them."
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"Ananda, they shall all make offerings to as many Buddhas, Thus Come Ones, as
					there are motes of dust in fifty worlds, revering and honoring them, protecting
					and upholding their storehouses of Dharma. Then simultaneously, in the lands of
					the ten directions, they shall each realize Buddhahood. They shall all have the
					same name, "Jewelled Appearance-Thus Come One," One Worthy of Offerings, One of
					Proper and Universal Knowledge, One Whose Clarity and Conduct are Complete,
					Well Gone One who Understands the World, Unsurpassed Lord, a Subduing and
					Taming Hero, Teacher of Gods and People, Buddha, World Honored One. Their
					lifespans shall be one aeon, the adornments of their lands, the number of Sound
					Hearers and Bodhisattvas, as well as the length of the Proper Dharma and Dharma
					Images Ages shall all be the same.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 17
			-
				-
					At that time, the Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses,
					saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 1
				-
					-
						Upon these two thousand Sound Hearers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 2
				-
					-
						Now standing before me,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 3
				-
					-
						I bestow a prediction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 4
				-
					-
						Of their future realization of Buddhahood.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 5
				-
					-
						The Buddhas to whom they shall make offerings
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 6
				-
					-
						Shall be in number as stated above.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 7
				-
					-
						Protecting and upholding their Dharma storehouses,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 8
				-
					-
						They shall afterwards realize Proper Enlightenment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 9
				-
					-
						Each one, throughout the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 10
				-
					-
						Shall have the same name,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 11
				-
					-
						And at the same time sit upon their Bodhimandas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 12
				-
					-
						Because they shall have certified to Supreme Wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 13
				-
					-
						They shall all be called "Jeweled Appearance"
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 14
				-
					-
						Their lands and their disciples,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 15
				-
					-
						And the length of the Proper Dharma and Dharma Image Ages,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 16
				-
					-
						Shall be identical with no difference.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 17
				-
					-
						They shall all use spiritual powers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 18
				-
					-
						To save living beings in the ten directions.
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 19
				-
					-
						Their renown shall be all pervasive,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 17: Line 20
				-
					-
						As they gradually enter into Nirvana.
					-
			-
				Chapter 9: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time, the two thousand people, both those who study and those beyond
					study, hearing the Buddha bestow these predictions, jumped for joy and spoke
					verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						O World Honored One, Bright-Lamp-of-Wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						Hearing the sound of these predictions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						Our hearts are filled with joy,
					-
				-
					Chapter 9: Verse 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						As if sprinkled with sweet dew.
					-
		-
			Chapter 10
		-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, through Medicine King Bodhisattva, spoke to
					the eighty thousand great lords saying, "Medicine King, do you see within this
					great assembly the limitless gods, Dragon Kings, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras,
					Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas. and beings both human and non human, as well as
					the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, Upasikas, those seeking to be Sound
					Hearers, those seeking to be Pratyekabuddhas, and those seeking the Buddha
					Path? Upon such ones as these, all in the presence of the Buddha, who hear but
					one verse or one sentence of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra, or who
					have even one thought of rejoicing in it, I bestow predictions of their future
					attainment of Annuttarasamyaksambodhi."
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 2
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Medicine King: "Furthermore, after the extinction of the Thus
					Come One, should there be one who hears but a single verse or a single sentence
					of The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra or who has even one thought of
					rejoicing in it, I bestow upon him as well a prediction of
					Annuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"Further, should there be one who receives and upholds, reads and recites,
					explains and teaches, or copies out The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra, be
					it even a single verse, looking upon the sutra text with reverence as he would
					the Buddha himself, making various kinds of offerings of flowers, incense,
					beads, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies,
					banners, clothing and music, or who even join his palms in reverence, O
					Medicine King, you should know that such a person has in the past already made
					offerings to tens of myriads of millions of Buddhas, in the presence of those
					Buddhas, accomplishing great vows. It is out of pity for living beings that he
					is born among human beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"O Medicine King, if someone should ask you what type of living beings shall in
					the future become Buddhas, you should point out to him that these very people
					in the future certainly shall become Buddhas. Why is this? If a good man or
					good woman receives and upholds, reads, recites, explains and teaches, or
					writes out even a single sentence of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra,
					or makes various offerings to the sutra text of flower, incense, beads,
					powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners,
					clothing, music, or reverently joined palms, that person should be looked up to
					in reverence by those in all worlds and should receive offerings befitting the
					Thus Come One. You should know that this person is a great Bodhisattva, one who
					has accomplished Annuttarasamyaksambodhi. Out of pity for living beings, he has
					vowed to be born here and to expound upon The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower
					Sutra broadly and in detail.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"How much the more does this apply to one who can receive and uphold it in its
					entirety and make various kinds of offerings to it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, you should know that this person has renounced his own pure
					Karmic reward and, after my extinction, out of pity for living beings, has been
					born in the evil world to vastly proclaim this Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"If this good man or good woman after my extinction can secretly explain even
					so much as a single sentence of The Dharma Flower Sutra for a single person,
					you should know that this person is a messenger of the Thus Come One, sent by
					the Thus Come One to do the Thus Come One's work.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"How much the more so is this the case for one who can in the midst of a great
					assembly extensively explain it to people.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"O Medicine King, should an evil person with unwholesome mind appear before the
					Buddha, slandering and scolding him constantly for the length of an aeon, his
					offenses would be relatively light compared to the offenses of a person who
					speaks even a single evil word reviling one who reads or recites The Dharma
					Flower Sutra. That person's offense would be very grave.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"O Medicine King, you should know that one who reads and recites The Dharma
					Flower Sutra takes the Buddha's adornments as his own adornments. He shall
					carry the Thus Come One on his shoulders. Wherever he goes, he should be
					welcomed with obeisance. Single mindedly, and with palms joined, one should pay
					reverence, make offerings, honor, and praise him. He should receive the finest
					offerings among people, offerings of flowers, incense, beads, powdered incense,
					paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, clothing, fine food,
					and music. Heavenly jewels should be scattered over him, and clusters of the
					finest heavenly jewels offered to him.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? When this person joyfully speaks the Dharma, those who
					hear it for but an instant shall directly achieve ultimate
					Annuttarasamyaksambodhi"
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 12
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate these principles, spoke

					-
						Of all the Sutras I have spoken,

						The Dharma Flower is foremost.

			-

			-
				-
					At that time, the Buddha further told the Bodhisattva, Mahasattva Medicine
					King, "Of all the limitless thousands of myriads of millions of Sutras I have
					spoken, am speaking, or will speak, The Dharma Flower is the hardest to believe
					and the hardest to understand.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, this Sutra is the treasury of the Buddhas' secrets and

					this be the case after his extinction!"

			-
				-
					"Medicine King, you should know that after my extinction, those who can write

					be covered with the Thus Come One's robes and shall also be protected and held
					in mind by the Buddhas present in other directions. These people have great
					powers of faith, powers of resolution and vows and the power of good roots.
					Know that these people shall dwell together with the Thus Come One and shall
					have their heads rubbed by the hand of the Thus Come One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, in any place where this Sutra is spoken, read, recited, written
					out, or stored, one should build a Stupa of the seven jewels, making it high,
					broad, and adorned. It is not necessary to place Sharira in it. Why is this?
					Within it already is the complete body of the Thus Come One. To this Stupa one
					should make offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, beads, silk canopies,
					banners, vocal and instrumental music, honoring and praising it. If people
					should see this Stupa, bow before it, and make offerings to it, you should know
					that they are close to Annuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, many people, both at home and left home, practice the
					Bodhisattva Path. If they are unable to see, hear, recite, write out, uphold,
					or make offerings to The Dharma Flower Sutra, know that these people have not
					yet skillfully practiced the Bodhisattva Path. If they are able to hear this
					Sutra, then they will be able to skillfully practice the Bodhisattva Path.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"If living beings who seek the Buddha Path get to see or hear The Dharma Flower
					Sutra and, having done so, receive and uphold it with faith and understanding,
					know that these people have drawn near to Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, it is like a person who is thirsty and in need of water.
					Although he digs for it on a high plain, all he sees in dry earth, and he knows
					the water is still far off. He continues efforts without cease and eventually
					sees moist earth and then mud. He is then certain that water must be close at
					hand.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 20
			-
				-
					"The Bodhisattvas are also like this. Know that those who have not yet heard,
					not yet understood, or not yet put into practice The Dharma Flower Sutra, are
					still far from Anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Those who have heard and understood,
					thought upon, and put it into practice certainly should be known as coming near
					to Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"What is the reason? The Anuttarasamyaksambodhi of all the Bodhisattvas belongs
					to this Sutra. Thus Sutra opens the expedient Dharma doors. It demonstrates the
					true, real mark. The storehouse of The Dharma Flower Sutra is deep, solid,
					recondite, and far reaching. No one could reach it except that now, the Buddha,
					in teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas and bringing them to
					accomplishment, demonstrates it for their sakes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, if a Bodhisattva upon hearing The Dharma Flower Sutra is
					frightened or afraid, you should know that he is a Bodhisattva of newly
					resolved mind. If a Sound Hearer, upon hearing this Sutra is frightened or
					afraid, you should know that he is one of overweening arrogance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 23
			-
				-
					Medicine King, if there is a good man or a good woman, after the extinction of
					the Thus Come One, who wishes to speak The Dharma Flower Sutra for the sake of
					the Four Assemblies, how should they speak it? This good man or good woman
					should enter the Thus Come One's room, put on the Thus Come One's role, sit on
					the Thus Come One's throne, and only then expound upon this Sutra for the sake
					of the Four Assemblies.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 24
			-
				-
					"The Thus Come One's room is the mind of great compassion towards all living
					beings. The Thus Come One's robes are the mind of gentleness and patience. The
					Thus Come One's throne is the emptiness of all Dharmas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 25
			-
				-
					"Established security in these one may then, with an unflagging mind expound
					upon The Dharma Flower Sutra for the sake of the Bodhisattvas and the Four
					Assemblies.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"Medicine King, from another country, I will send transformed people to gather
					an assembly of Dharma listeners. I will also send transformed Bhikshus,
					Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and Upasikas to listen to the Dharma being spoken. All
					these transformed people, hearing the Dharma, will believe it and accept it,
					and comply with it without objection. If one speaks the Dharma in an
					uninhabited place, I will send gods, ghosts, spirits, Gandharvas, Asuras, and
					so forth, to listen to him speak the Dharma. Although I am in another country,
					I will at all times cause the speaker of Dharma to be able to see me. Should he
					forget a single punctuation mark of the Sutra, I will remind him of it, causing
					his knowledge to be perfected."
				-
			-
				Chapter 10: Verse 27
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke

				-
					-
						One who wishes to get rid of laxness,

						This Sutra is hard to hear,

				Chapter 11: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time, there manifested before the Buddha a Stupa made of the seven
					jewels. It was five hundred Yojanas in height and two hundred and fifty Yojanas
					in breadth. It welled up out of the earth and stood in empty space, adorned
					with all kinds of jeweled objects. It had five thousand railings and thousands
					of myriads of alcoves. Countless banners and pennants adorned it as well.
					Jeweled beads were hung from it and myriads of millions of jeweled bells were
					suspended from its top. The scent of Tamalapatracandana issued from all four
					sides and filled the entire world. All its banners and canopies were made of
					the seven jewels: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother of pearl, carnelian, real
					pearls and agate reaching up to the palace of the four heavenly kings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 2
			-
				-
					From the Heaven of the Thirty-Three there rained heavenly Mandarva flowers as
					an offering to the jeweled Stupa. All the gods, dragons, Yakshas, Gandharvas,
					Ashuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, humans, non-humans and so forth,
					thousands of myriads of millions of them, made offerings to the jeweled Stupa
					of all kinds of flowers, incense, beads, banners, canopies and instrumental
					music, reverently honoring it and praising it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 3
			-
				-
					At that time, a loud voice issued from the Stupa speaking in praise, saying,
					"Good indeed, good indeed, Shakyamuni, World Honored One that you are able, by
					means of your undifferentiating great wisdom, to speak for the great assembly,
					The Wonderful Dharma Flower Sutra, a Dharma for teaching Bodhisattvas of whom
					the Buddhas are protective and mindful. So it is, so it is, Shakyamuni, World
					Honored One, that all you say is true and real."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Just then the Four Assemblies, seeing the great jeweled Stupa standing in
					mid-air and hearing the voice from within it, all gained Dharma joy and
					marveled at this unprecedented occurrence. They rose from their seats, revently
					placed their palms together and withdrew to one side.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Just then a Bodhisattva Mahasattva by the name of Great Delight in speaking,
					knowing the doubts in the minds of all the gods, humans, and Asuras and others
					from all the worlds, spoke to the Buddha saying, "World Honored One, by means
					of what causes and conditions has this jeweled Stupa welled up out of the earth
					and produced this loud sound?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Then the Buddha told the Bodhisattva Great Delight in speaking, "Within this
					jeweled Stupa is the complete body of the Thus Come One. Long ago, limitless
					thousands of myriads of millions of Asankheya worlds to the east, in a land
					called Jeweled Purity, there was a Buddha by the name of Many Jewels. When this
					Buddha was practicing the Bodhisattva path, he made a great vow saying, 'After
					I have become a Buddha and passed into extinction, in any of the ten direction
					lands where the Dharma Flower Sutra is being spoken, my Stupa shall appear
					there, that I may hear the Sutra and certify it, praising it, saying, 'Good
					indeed! good indeed!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"After that Buddha had realized the Way, when he was about to enter into
					extinction, in the great assembly of gods and humans he spoke to the Bhikshus
					saying, 'After my extinction, those who wish to make offerings to my complete
					body should build a large Stupa.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"By the power of his spiritual penetrations and his vow' throughout the ten
					direction worlds wherever anyone speaks The Dharma Flower Sutra that Buddha's
					jeweled Stupa containing his complete body wells up from the earth before the
					one speaking and expresses praise by saying, 'Good indeed! Good indeed!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"Great Delight in speaking! Because he has heard The Dharma Flower Sutra being
					spoken, the Stupa of the Thus Come One Many Jewels has now welled up out of the
					earth with these words of praise, "Good indeed! Good indeed!'"
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Just then, the Bodhisattva Great Delight in speaking, by means of the spiritual
					power of The Thus Come One, spoke to the Buddha saying, "World Honored One, we
					all wish to see this Buddha's body."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 11
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Mahasattva Great Delight in speaking, "The
					Buddha Many Jewels has made a profound and solemn vow: When my jeweled Stupa
					manifests in the presence of the Buddhas because The Dharma Flower Sutra is
					heard, if there is anyone who wishes me to show my body to the Four Assemblies,
					then the division body Buddhas of that Buddha who is speaking Dharma in the
					worlds of the ten directions, must all return and gather together in one place.
					Afterward, my body will appear.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"Great Delight in Speaking, my division body Buddhas present in the ten
					direction worlds speaking Dharma should now gather together."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Great Delight in Speaking said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, we also wish
					to see the division bodies of the World Honored One so that we may bow to them
					and make offerings."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 14
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha emitted a white-hair mark light in which were seen the
					Buddhas of the lands in the eastern direction equal in number to the grains of
					sand in five hundred myriads of millions of Nayutas of Ganges rivers. All the
					Buddhalands had crystal for soil, and were adorned with jeweled trees and
					jeweled clothing. Countless thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas
					filled them. They were covered with jeweled canopies and jeweled nets. The
					Buddhas in those lands with a great and wonderful sound, were speaking the
					Dharma. Also seen were limitless thousands of myriads of millions of
					Bodhisattvas filling those lands speaking the Dharma for the multitudes. Thus
					it was also in the south, west, north, the four intermediate directions, as
					well as up and downward wherever the white hair-mark light shone.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time all the Buddhas of the ten directions addressed the host of
					Bodhisattvas saying, "Good men! We should now go to the Saha world, to the
					place of Shakyamuni Buddha and make offerings to the Stupa of the Thus Come One
					Many Jewels."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Just then the Saha world was transformed into one of purity, with lapis lazuli
					for soil and adorned with jeweled trees. Its eight roads were bordered with
					golden cards. In it there were no towns, villages, cities, oceans, rivers,
					streams, mountains, brooks, forests or thickets. Precious incense was burned
					and Mandarava flowers completely covered the ground. Above it were spread
					jeweled nets and banners hung with jeweled bells. Only those in the assembly
					remained, as the gods and humans had been moved to another land.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Then all the Buddhas, each bringing with him one great Bodhisattva as an
					attendant, reached the Saha world and went to the foot of a jeweled tree. Each
					jeweled tree was five hundred Yojanas in height and adorned with branches,
					leaves, flowers and fruits. Beneath each jeweled tree was a lion throne five
					hundred Yojanas in height adorned with great jewels. Then each of the Buddhas
					sat in the lotus posture on his own throne.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 18
			-
				-
					In this way, by turns, the lands of the three thousand great thousand world
					were filled, and still there was no end to the division bodies of Shakyamuni
					Buddha from even one direction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Then Shakyamuni Buddha, wishing to accommodate his division body Buddhas,
					transformed in each of the eight directions, two hundred myriads of millions of
					Nayutas of lands, purifying them all. They were without hells, hungry ghosts,
					animals or Asuras. The gods and humans were all moved to other lands. The lands
					he transformed all had lapis lazuli for soil and were adorned with jeweled
					trees five hundred Yojanas tall, decorated with branches, leaves, flowers and
					fruits. Beneath each tree was a jeweled lion throne, five Yojanas tall
					decorated with various gems. There were no oceans, rivers or streams and no
					Mucilinda or Mahamucilinda mountains, no iron ring or great iron ring
					mountains, and no Mount Sumerus or other kings of mountains. All became one
					Buddha land. The jeweled earth was level and flat, covered entirely with
					gem-studded canopies and hung with banners. Precious incense was burned and
					heavenly, precious flowers covered the ground.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Shakyamuni Buddha, in order that the Buddhas who were coming might have a place
					to sit, then further transformed in each of the eight directions, two hundred
					myriads of Nayutas of lands, purifying them all. They were without hells,
					hungry ghosts, animals or Asuras. The gods and humans were all moved to other
					lands. The lands he transformed all had lapis lazuli for soil and were adorned
					with jeweled trees five hundred Yojanas tall, decorated with branches, leaves,

				-

			-
				-
					Then, the division bodies of Shakyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction,
					Buddhas in number to the grains of sand in a hundred thousand myriads of
					millions of Nayutas of lands, each speaking the Dharma, assembled there. In
					like manner, in turn, the Buddhas from all the ten directions arrived and
					assembled there, taking their seats in the eight directions.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 22
			-
				-
					At that time, each direction was filled with Buddhas, Thus Come Ones, from the
					four hundred myriads of millions of nayutas of lands in each of the four
					directions.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 23
			-
				-
					At that time, all those Buddhas each seated on a lion throne beneath a jeweled
					tree, sent an attendant to inquire after Shakyamuni Buddha giving them each a
					sack full of flowers and saying to them, "Good men! Go to Mount Grdhrakuta, to
					the place of Shakyamuni Buddha and ask, in our name, 'Are you free from illness
					and distress? Are you strong and at ease? Are the hosts of Bodhisattvas and
					Sound Hearers at peace?' Then scatter these precious flowers before the Buddha
					as an offering saying, 'The Buddha so-and-so wishes that the jeweled Stupa be
					opened.'" All the Buddhas sent attendants in this manner.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 24
			-
				-
					Then, Shakyamuni Buddha, seeing that the division body Buddhas had all
					assembled there, each seated on a lion throne, and hearing that all the Buddhas
					together wished that the jeweled Stupa be opened, immediately arose from his
					seat into empty space. All those of the Four Assemblies rose, placed their
					palms together, and singlemindedly beheld the Buddha.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 25
			-
				-
					Then, Shakyamuni Buddha, using his right-forefinger, opened the door of the
					Stupa of seven jewels, which made a great sound like that of a bolt being
					removed from a large city gate.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 26
			-
				-
					Thereupon, the entire assembly perceived the Thus Come One Many Jewels seated
					upon the lion throne inside the jeweled Stupa, his body whole and undecayed as
					if he were in Dhyana Samadhi. They also heard him say, "Good indeed! Good
					indeed! Shakyamuni Buddha! Quickly speak The Dharma Flower Sutra! I came here
					to hear this Sutra!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 27
			-
				-
					The Four Assemblies, upon seeing a Buddha who had crossed over into extinction
					limitless thousands of myriads of millions of aeons ago, speak in this way,
					praised it as something unprecedented, they scattered heaps of precious
					heavenly flowers upon the Buddha Many Jewels and Shakyamuni Buddha.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 28
			-
				-
					The Buddha Many Jewels, in the jeweled Stupa, offered half of his seat to
					Shakyamuni Buddha, saying, "Shakyamuni Buddha, would you take this seat?"
					Shakyamuni Buddha then entered the Stupa and sat down in full lotus on half of
					that seat.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 29
			-
				-
					The great assembly, seeing the two Thus Come Ones seated in the jeweled Stupa
					in full lotus on the lion throne, all had this thought, "The Buddhas are
					sitting up so high and far off. We only wish that the Thus Come One would use
					the power of his spiritual penetrations and enable us all to dwell in empty
					space."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 30
			-
				-
					Shakyamuni Buddha then used his spiritual powers and took the entire assembly
					up into empty space.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 31
			-
				-
					With a great voice he addressed the Four Assemblies, saying; "Who, in this Saha
					land, can broadly speak this Sutra of the Dharma Flower? Now is the proper
					time, for the Thus Come One will shortly enter Nirvana. The Buddha wishes to
					bequeath The Dharma Flower Sutra."
				-
			-
				Chapter 11: Verse 32
			-
				-
					The World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 1
				-
					-
						The sagely lord, World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 2
				-
					-
						Although long extinct
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 3
				-
					-
						Within this jeweled Stupa
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 4
				-
					-
						Has come here for the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 5
				-
					-
						Who would not be diligent
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 6
				-
					-
						For the sake of the Dharma?
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 7
				-
					-
						This Buddha became extinct
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 8
				-
					-
						Countless aeons ago and yet,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 9
				-
					-
						In place after place, he listens to the Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 10
				-
					-
						Because it is difficult to encounter.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 11
				-
					-
						In the past this Buddha made a vow,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 12
				-
					-
						"After my extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 13
				-
					-
						I will go everywhere
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 14
				-
					-
						In order to hear the Dharma."
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 15
				-
					-
						Also, my division bodies,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 16
				-
					-
						Limitless Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 17
				-
					-
						Equal in number to the Ganges' sands
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 18
				-
					-
						Have come, wishing to hear the Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 19
				-
					-
						And to see the extinct
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 20
				-
					-
						Thus Come One, Many Jewels.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 21
				-
					-
						Casting aside their wondrous lands
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 22
				-
					-
						And assemblies of disciples
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 23
				-
					-
						Gods, people, dragons and spirits,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 24
				-
					-
						And various offerings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 25
				-
					-
						They have come here
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 26
				-
					-
						To cause the Dharma long to abide.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 27
				-
					-
						In order to seat those Buddhas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 28
				-
					-
						I have used my spiritual powers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 29
				-
					-
						To move countless multitudes
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 30
				-
					-
						And purify the lands.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 31
				-
					-
						Each one of the Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 32
				-
					-
						Takes his place beneath a jeweled tree
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 33
				-
					-
						Like a lotus adoring
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 34
				-
					-
						A clear, clean pond.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 35
				-
					-
						Beneath the jeweled trees,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 36
				-
					-
						There are lion thrones
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 37
				-
					-
						Upon which the Buddhas sit,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 38
				-
					-
						Adorned with brilliant light,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 39
				-
					-
						Like great torches gleaming
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 40
				-
					-
						In the darkness of the night.
					-

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 41

						Their bodies emit a delicate fragrance
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 42

						Prevading the ten direction lands

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 43
				-
					-
						All beings perfumed by it
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 44
				-
					-
						Are overwhelmed with joy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 45
				-
					-
						Like a great wind
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 46
				-
					-
						Blowing the small trees,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 47
				-
					-
						By means of this expedient device,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 48
				-
					-
						The Dharma is caused long to abide.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 49

						To the great assembly. I say:

				-
					-
						Now, in the presence of the Buddhas
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 54

						He should make a vow.

						As well as myself,

				-
					-
						And the transformation Buddhas here assembled
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 62
				-
					-
						Will know of this resolution.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 63
				-

						All you disciples of the Buddha,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 64
				-
					-
						Whoever can protect this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 65

				-
					-
						The Buddha Many Jewels
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 70
				-
					-
						Has thereby made offerings
					-

						To me and Many Jewels.

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 72
				-

						Dwelling in the jeweled Stupa,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 73
				-
					-
						Always travels throughout the ten directions,

				-
					-
						For the sake of this Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 75
				-

						Moreover, they will have made offerings,

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 76
				-

						To the transformation Buddhas here,

				-
					-
						All the worlds.

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 79
				-
					-
						If one speaks this Sutra,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 80
				-

						They will then see me,

						The Thus Come One Many Jewels,

				-
					-
						All of you good men
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 84
				-
					-
						Think it over carefully!
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 85
				-
					-
						This is a difficult matter
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 86

						Other Sutras number

						Like the Ganges river's sands

				-
					-
						But although one spoke them,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 90
				-
					-
						It would not be thought difficult.

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 91
				-
					-
						If one took Mount Sumeru

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 92

				-
					-
						Across countless Buddhas lands,

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 94

						That also would not be difficult.

						Or if with a toe

						One kicked the great thousand worlds

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 97
				-

						That also would not be difficult.

						Were one to stand on the peak of being

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 100

						Limitless other Sutras,

				-
					-
						Within the evil age,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 105
				-
					-
						One can speak this Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 106
				-
					-
						That is difficult.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 107
				-
					-
						If someone took
					-

				-
					-
						Empty space in his hand
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 109
				-
					-
						And wandered around with it
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 110
				-
					-
						That would not be difficult.

				-
					-
						And encourage others to write it out,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 114
				-
					-
						That is difficult.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 115
				-
					-
						If one were to take the earth
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 116
				-
					-
						And place it on one's toenail,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 117
				-
					-
						And carry it up to the Brahma heavens,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 118
				-
					-
						That, too, would not be difficult.

				-
					-
						To read this Sutra but for an instant,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 123
				-
					-
						If, during the fire at the Kalpa's end

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 124

						One carried a load of dry grass on one's back
					-

				-
					-
						And entering the fire was not burned

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 126

						That would not be difficult.

				-
					-
						And speak it to a single person,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 130

						That is difficult.

				-
					-
						Dharma treasuries
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 133

						And the Twelve Divisions of the canon

				-
					-
						Expounding upon them to others

					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 135
				-
					-
						Causing all the listeners
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 136

						To gain the Six Spiritual Penetrations,

				-
					-
						Even if one could do this

					-
						And inquire into its meaning

				-
					-
						If one were to speak the Dharma

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 144
				-
					-
						And cause a thousand myriads of millions

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 145
				-
					-
						Of limitless, countless
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 146
				-
					-
						Beings, like the Ganges' sands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 147
				-
					-
						To obtain Arhatship

				-
					-
						And perfect the Six Spiritual Penetrations,

				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 149
				-
					-
						Although it would be beneficial,

						If one can reverently uphold

				-
					-
						such a Sutra as this
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 154
				-
					-
						That indeed is difficult!
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 155
				-
					-
						I, for the sake of the Buddha Way,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 156
				-
					-
						Throughout limitless lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 157
				-
					-
						From the beginning until now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 158
				-
					-
						Have broadly expounded all the Sutras
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 159
				-
					-
						And among them all
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 160
				-
					-
						This Sutra is foremost.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 161
				-
					-
						If one can uphold it
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 162
				-
					-
						He then upholds the Buddha's body.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 163
				-
					-
						Good men,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 164
				-
					-
						After my extinction,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 165
				-
					-
						Who can receive and uphold,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 166
				-
					-
						Read, and recite this Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 167
				-
					-
						Now, in the presence of the Buddhas should make a vow.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 168
				-
					-
						This Sutra is hard to uphold,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 169
				-
					-
						If one upholds it for but an instant,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 170
				-
					-
						I will rejoice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 171
				-
					-
						And so will all the Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 172
				-
					-
						One such as this
					-
				-
					Chapter 11: Verse 32: Line 173
				-
					-
						Shall be praised by all the Buddhas:

			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time, the Buddha told the Bodhisattvas, gods, humans, and the Four
					Assemblies, "In the past, throughout limitless aeons, I sought the Dharma
					Flower Sutra without laxness or weariness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"For many aeons, I was a king and vowed to seek supreme Bodhi with an
					unretreating mind.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"Wishing to perfect the Six Paramitas, I diligently practiced giving, my mind
					not begrudging elephants, horses, the seven precious things, countries, cities,
					wives, children, slaves servants, even my head, eyes, marrow, brains, body,
					flesh, hands, and feet-not sparing even life itself.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"The people of that time had a limitless lifespan. For the sake of the Dharma,
					I renounced the royal position, leaving the government to the crown prince. I
					beat upon the Dharma drum, announcing my search for Dharma in the four
					directions, saying, 'Whoever can speak the Great Vehicle for me, for him I will
					act as a servant for the rest of my life!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"At that time a seer came forth and spoke to the king, saying, 'I have a Great
					Vehicle scripture by the name of The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra. If
					you do not disobey me, I will expound it for you.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"When I, the king, heard the seer's words, I jumped for joy. I then followed
					the seer, supplying all of his needs: picking fruit, drawing water, gathering
					firewood, and preparing food, even offering my own body as a couch for him,
					feeling no weariness in body or mind. I served him for a thousand years, for
					the sake of the Dharma, diligently waiting upon him so he lacked nothing."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 7
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 1
				-
					-
						I recall, in Kalpas past, when seeking Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 2
				-
					-
						Although I was a king at the time
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 3
				-
					-
						I had no greed to enjoy the Five Desires.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 4
				-
					-
						Ringing the bell, I announced in the four directions:
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 5
				-
					-
						"If whoever has the Great Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 6
				-
					-
						Will explain it to me, I will be his servant."
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 7
				-
					-
						"Then the seer Asita came and spoke to me,

				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 8
				-
					-
						The king, saying, 'I have the subtle, wonderful Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 9
				-
					-
						Rare in all the world. If you can cultivate it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 10

					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 11
				-
					-
						"Hearing what the seer said,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 12
				-
					-
						My heart was filled with great joy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 13
				-
					-
						I then followed the seer,

				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 14

					-
						Supplying him with all his needs,

						Gather firewood, fruit, and melons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 16
				-
					-
						Respectfully presenting them at the proper time.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 17
				-
					-
						Because I cherished the Wonderful Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 18
				-
					-
						I was neither lax nor tired in body or mind.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 19
				-
					-
						I diligently sought the Great Dharma
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 20
				-
					-
						For the sake of all living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 21
				-
					-
						And not for my own sake,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 22
				-
					-
						Or for the pleasure of the Five Desires.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 23
				-
					-
						Thus as King of a Great Realm,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 24
				-
					-
						I diligently sought to obtain this Dharma,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 25
				-
					-
						And accordingly achieved Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 7: Line 26
				-
					-
						And now I speak it to you.
					-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 8
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bhikshus, "The king was I, myself, in a former life and the
					seer was the present Devadatta.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"It is because of my good and wise advisor, Devadatta, that I have perfected
					the Six Paramitas of kindness, compassion, joy, and giving, as well as the
					Thirty-two Marks and Eighty Fine Characteristics, coloring of burnished
					purple-gold, the Ten Powers, the Four Fearlessnesses, the Four Dharmas of
					Attraction, the Eighteen Unshared Dharmas, the power of the way of spiritual
					penetrations, the accomplishment of equal, proper enlightenment, and the vast
					rescue of living beings. All this came about because of my good and wise
					advisor, Devadatta.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"I announce to the Four Assemblies that, after limitless aeons have passed,
					Devadatta will become a Buddha by the name of King of Gods Thus Come One, One
					Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Whose Clarity
					and Conduct are Complete, Well-gone One Who Understands the World, Supreme
					Lord, Regulating Hero, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World Honored One.
					His world shall be called Pathway of the Gods.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"He shall dwell in the world for twenty middle-sized aeons, broadly speaking
					the wonderful Dharma for living beings. Living beings in number like the Ganges
					sands shall attain the fruit of Arhatship. Limitless living beings will bring
					forth the resolve to enlighten to conditions. Living beings in number like
					Ganges sands will bring forth the Supreme Mind of the Path, attain Patience
					with the Non-production of Dharmas, and arrive at irreversibility.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"After the Parinirvana of the Buddha King of Gods, the proper Dharma will dwell
					in the world for twenty middle-sized aeons. A stupa sixty Yojanas high and
					forty Yojanas wide, made of the seven jewels will be built to hold the Sharira
					of his complete body. All the gods and humans shall make offerings to and
					worship the wonderful stupa of seven jewels, using various flowers, powdered
					incense, burning license, paste incense, clothing, beads, banners, jeweled
					canopies, instrumental and vocal music.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Limitless living beings shall attain the fruit of Arhatship. Limitless living
					beings will awaken to Pratyeka Buddhahood. An inconceivable number of living
					beings will bring forth the resolve for Bodhi and reach irreversibility."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 14
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bhikshus, in the future if a good man or good woman hears
					the Devadatta chapter of The Wonderful Dharma Flower Sutra and with a pure mind
					believes and reveres it, having no doubts, he will not fall into the hells,
					into the realm of hungry ghosts, or into the animal realm. He will be born in
					the presence of the Buddhas of the ten directions, always hearing this Sutra
					wherever he may be born. Should he be reborn among humans and gods, he will
					receive supreme and subtle bliss. If born in the presence of a Buddha, he will
					be born by transformation from a Lotus Flower."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time, a Bodhisattva-attendant of Many Jewel, World Honored One, from
					the lower regions by the name of Wisdom Accumulation, spoke to the Buddha Many
					Jewels, saying, "Let's return to our own land."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Shakyamuni Buddha told Wisdom Accumulation, "Good man, wait a moment longer.
					There is a Bodhisattva named Manjushri. You should meet him and discuss the
					Wonderful Dharma. Then you may return to your country."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Then Manjushri, sitting on a thousand petalled lotus as large as a carriage
					wheel, along with the Bodhisattvas who accompanied him, also sitting on jeweled
					lotuses, spontaneously rose up out of the Great Sea from the Sagara Dragon
					Palace. They rose high into the air and went to Magic Vulture Mountain.
					Descending from his lotus, he went before the Buddhas and bowed in worship at
					the feet of the two World Honored Ones. Having paid his respects, he went up to
					Wisdom-Accumulation and when they had inquired after each other's welfare, they
					moved to one side and sat down.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 18
			-
				-
					Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva asked Manjushri, "Humane one, how many living
					beings have you taught there in the Dragon Palace?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Manjushri Bodhisattva, replied, "An unlimited, unreckronable number, one that
					cannot be expressed in words or fathomed by the mind. Wait just a moment and
					you will have proof for yourself."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Before he had finished speaking, countless Bodhisattvas sitting upon jeweled
					lotuses rose up out of the sea, went to Magic Vulture Mountain and hovered
					there in space. These Bodhisattvas had been taught and crossed over by
					Manjushri Bodhisattva. All of them had perfected the Bodhisattva practices and
					were discussing among themselves the Six Paramitas. Those who had been Sound
					Hearers were in empty space expounding upon the practices of Sound Hearers. All
					of them were now cultivating the principle of emptiness of the Great Vehicle.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 21
			-
				-
					Manjushri Bodhisattva said to Wisdom Accumulation, "Such is the work of
					teaching and transforming that I have done within the sea."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 22
			-
				-
					At that time, Wisdom Accumulation spoke these verses of praise:
				-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 1
				-
					-
						"O greatly wise, virtuous and courageous one,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 2
				-
					-
						You have taught and saved countless beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 3
				-
					-
						Now this great assembly and I
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 4
				-
					-
						Have seen this for ourselves.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 5
				-
					-
						Proclaiming the Real Mark's principle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 6
				-
					-
						Opening the Dharma of One Vehicle,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 7
				-
					-
						You are a guide for all living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 22: Line 8
				-
					-
						Leading them quickly to Bodhi's realization."
					-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 23
			-
				-
					Manjushri said, "While in the sea, I have proclaimed and taught only The
					Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 24
			-
				-
					Wisdom Accumulation asked Manjushri, "This Sutra is extremely profound and
					subtle. Among all the Sutras, it is a jewel rarely found in the world. Is there
					any living being who can, through diligence and vigor, cultivate this Sutra and
					quickly gain Buddhahood?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 25
			-
				-
					Manjushri said, "There is a Dragon King's daughter who is just eight years old.
					She is the faculties, conducts, and Karmas of living beings and has attained
					Dharani. She is able to receive and uphold the entire storehouse of extremely
					profound secrets spoken by the Buddha. She has deeply entered Dhyana Samadhi
					and thoroughly penetrated all Dharmas. In the space of a Kshana she brought
					broth the Bodhi mind and attained to irreversibility. Her eloquence is
					unobstructed and she is compassionately mindful of all living beings as if they
					were her children. Her merit and virtue is complete. The thoughts of her mind
					and the words from her mouth are subtle, wonderful, and expansive. She is
					compassionate, humane and yielding; harmonious and refined in mind and will,
					and she is able to arrive at Bodhi."
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 26
			-
				-
					Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva said, "I have seen the Thus Come One Shakyamuni
					practicing difficult ascetic practices throughout limitless aeons, accumulating
					merit and virtue as he sought Bodhi without ever resting. As I observe the
					three thousand great thousand worlds, there is no place, not even one the size
					of a mustard seed, where as a Bodhisattva he did not renounce his life for the
					sake of living beings. Only after that did he attain the Bodhi Way. I do not
					believe that this girl can accomplish proper enlightenment in the space of an
					instant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 27
			-
				-
					They had not yet finished their daughter suddenly appeared before them, bowed
					with her head at their feet, and withdrew to one side to speak these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 1
				-
					-
						"Having deeply understood the marks
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 2
				-
					-
						Of offenses and blessings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 3
				-
					-
						By shining throughout the ten directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 4
				-
					-
						Now the wondrous, pure Dharma Body,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 5
				-
					-
						Is complete with the Thirty-two Marks and
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 6
				-
					-
						The Eight Minor Characteristics.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 7
				-
					-
						The adorned Dharma Body
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 8
				-
					-
						Is honored and looked up to by gods and humans,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 9
				-
					-
						And revered by all the dragons and spirits.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 10
				-
					-
						Of all the varieties of beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 11
				-
					-
						None fail to respect and revere it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 12
				-
					-
						Hearing about the realization of Bodhi,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 13
				-
					-
						Which only a Buddha can certify to,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 14
				-
					-
						I proclaim the Great Vehicle teaching,
					-
				-
					Chapter 12: Verse 27: Line 15
				-
					-
						Which liberates suffering living beings."
					-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 28
			-
				-
					At that time, Shariputra spoke to the Dragon Girl, saying, "You claim quick
					attainment to the Supreme Path. This is difficult to believe. Why? The body of
					a woman is filthy and not a vessel for the Dharma. How can you attain to the
					Supreme Bodhi? The Buddha Path is remote and distant. Only after one has passed
					through limitless aeons, diligently bearing suffering and accumulating one's
					conduct, perfecting one's cultivation of all Paramitas, can one then attain
					realization. What is more, a woman's body has Five Obstacles: one, she cannot
					become a Brahma heaven king; two, she cannot become Shakra; three, she cannot
					become a Mara king; four, she cannot become a Wheel Turning Sage king; five,
					she cannot become a Buddha. How can a woman quickly realize Buddhahood?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 29
			-
				-
					Now the Dragon Girl had a precious pearl, its worth equal to the entire system
					of three thousand great thousand worlds, which she took before the Buddha and
					presented to him. The Buddha immediately accepted it. The Dragon Girl then said
					to Wisdom Accumulation and the venerable Shariputra, "I just offered up this
					precious pearl and the World Honored One accepted it. Was that quick or not?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"Very quick!" They answered.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 31
			-
				-
					The girl said, "With your spiritual powers, watch as I become a Buddha even
					more quickly than that!" At that moment, the entire assembly saw the Dragon
					Girl suddenly transform into a man and perfect the Bodhisattva conduct.
					Instantly she went off to the south, to the world without filth, where, seated
					on a jeweled lotus, she accomplished Equal and Proper Enlightenment and
					embodied the Thirty two Marks and Eighty Minor Characteristics. There, for the
					sake of all living beings throughout the ten directions, she proceeded to
					proclaim the wonderful Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 32
			-
				-
					While the Bodhisattvas, Sound Hearers, gods, dragon, and the rest of the
					Eightfold Division, both humans and non-humans in the Saha world all watched
					from a distance as the Dragon Girl became a Buddha and spoke the Dharma for all
					the gods and humans, they rejoiced exceedingly and reverently made obeisance
					from afar. Hearing that Dharma, limitless living beings understood and awoke,
					attaining to irreversibility. Countless living beings received predictions of
					the Way. The world without filth quaked in six ways, while in the Saha world,
					three thousand living beings came to dwell on the ground of irreversibility,
					and three thousand living beings brought forth the BodhI mind and gained
					predictions.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12: Verse 33
			-
				-
					Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva, Shariputra and the entire assembly silently
					believed and accepted.
				-
		-
			Chapter 13
		-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At that time the Bodhisattva, Mahasattva Medicine King, and the Bodhisattva,
					Mahasattva Great Delight in speaking, along with a retinue of twenty thousand
					Bodhisattvas came before the Buddha and made the following vow: "We only pray
					that the World Honored One will not be concerned. After the Buddha's
					extinction, we will reverently maintain, read, recite, and explain this Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"In the future evil ages, as their good roots diminish, living beings will
					become increasingly arrogant, greedy for benefits and offerings, of
					increasingly unwholesome roots, far removed from liberation, and difficult to
					teach and transform. Still, we shall give rise to the great power of patience,
					read and recite this Sutra, maintain and speak it, write it out, and make
					various kinds of offerings to it, not sparing our very bodies and lives."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Then, the five hundred Arhats in the assembly who had received predictions,
					spoke to the Buddha saying, "World Honored One, we too vow to speak this Sutra
					extensively in other lands."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Again, those still study and those beyond study, eight thousand in number, who
					had received predictions, rose from their seats, placed their palms together,
					and facing the Buddha made this vow, "World Honored One, we too, will speak
					this Sutra extensively in other lands. Why? The people in the Saha world are
					for the most part evil, arrogant, of scanty merit and virtue, hateful, turbid,
					flattering, and deceitful their hearts untrue."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 5
			-
				-
					The Buddha's foster mother, the Bhikshuni Mahaprajapti, together with six
					thousand Bhikshunis, both those still studying and those beyond study, rose
					from their seats, singlemindedly joined their palms, and gazed at the Honored
					One's countenance without removing their eyes for an instant. The World Honored
					One then spoke to Gautami saying, "Why do you stare at the Thus Come One with
					such a worried expression? Are you not thinking of saying that I have not
					mentioned your name in connection with receiving a prediction for
					Anuttarasamyaksambodhi? Gautami, I included all of you when previously I
					conferred predictions upon all of the Sound Hearers. Now you wish to know about
					your prediction. In the future, within the Dharma of sixty-eight billion
					Buddhas, you shall be a great Dharma master. You and the six thousand
					Bhikshunis who are studying and who are beyond study shall all become Dharma
					masters. In this way you shall gradually perfect the Bodhisattva path and
					become a Buddha by the name of "Thus Come One Upon Whom All Beings Look With
					Delight," One Worthy of Offerings, of Right and Universal Knowledge, Perfect in
					Clarity and Conduct, Well-gone One Who Understands the World, Supreme Lord,
					Regulating Hero, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World Honored One.
					Gautami! The Buddha Upon Whom All Beings Look With Delight and the six thousand
					Bodhisattvas will successfully confer predictions for Anuttarasamyaksambodhi
					upon one another.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 6
			-
				-
					The Bhikshuni Yashodhara, Rahula's mother, then thought, "When conferring
					predictions, the World Honored One never mentioned my name."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 7
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Yashodhara, "In a future age, within the Dharma of hundreds of
					thousands of ten thousands of millions of Buddhas, you shall cultivate the
					Bodhisattva conduct as a great Dharma master, gradually perfecting the Buddha
					path. In the World 'Wholesome' you shall become a Buddha by the name of 'The
					Thus Come One Complete with Tens of Thousands of Radiant Marks.' One Worthy of
					Offerings, of Right and Universal Knowledge, Perfect in Clarity and Conduct,
					Well-gone, One Who Understands the World, Supreme Lord, Regulating Hero,
					Teacher or Gods and Humans, Buddha, World Honored One. As a Buddha, your
					lifespan will be limitless Asankhyeya aeons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 8
			-
				-
					At that time, the Bhikshuni Mahaprajapati and the Bhikshuni Yashodhara,
					together with their retinues, all rejoiced greatly, having gained what they
					never had. The spoke these verses in the presence of the Buddha:
				-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 8: Line 1
				-
					-
						The World Honored One, Our leader,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 8: Line 2
				-
					-
						Brings tranquillity to gods and humans:
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 8: Line 3
				-
					-
						Hearing this prediction
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 8: Line 4
				-
					-
						Our hearts know perfect peace.
					-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 9
			-
				-
					When they had finished speaking this verse, the Bhikshunis said to the Buddha,
					"World Honored One, we too shall extensively proclaim this Sutra in other
					lands."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 10
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One looked upon the eighty billion Nayutas of
					Bodhisattva Mahasattvas.

				Chapter 13: Verse 11
			-
				-
					All of these Bodhisattvas were Avaivartikas who turned the irreversible Dharma
					wheel and who had attained all of the Dharanis. They immediately rose from
					their seats, went before the Buddha, singlemindedly with palms joined, and
					thought, "If the World Honored One were to command us to maintain and speak
					this Sutra, we would follow the Buddha's instruction and vastly proclaim this
					Dharma."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 12
			-
				-
					They further thought, :The Buddha is silent now and gives no command. What
					should we do?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Then all the Bodhisattvas, reverently complying with the Buddha's will, and
					wishing to fulfill their own past vows, went directly before the Buddha, and
					uttered the lion's roar, proclaiming this vow: "World Honored One, after the
					Thus Come One's extinction, we shall circulate throughout the ten directions to
					lead living beings to copy out this Sutra, to receive, maintain, read and
					recite, and explain its meaning, to cultivate in accord with Dharma, and to
					keep it properly in mind-all through the awesome power of the Buddha. We only
					pray that the World Honored One although dwelling in another direction will
					lend us his protection form afar."
				-
			-
				Chapter 13: Verse 14
			-
				-
					At that time, all the Bodhisattvas in unison raised their voices to speak
					verses saying:

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 1
				-
					-
						"Pray do not be concerned,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 2
				-

						For after the Buddha's extinction
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 3
				-
					-
						In the frightening evil age,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 4
				-
					-
						We will vastly preach.

					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 5
				-
					-
						Ignorant people
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 6
				-

						With evil mouth will revile us,

				-
					-
						Or even beat us with knives or staves,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 8

						But we will endure it all.

						Bhikshus in the evil age

					-
						With deviant knowledge and

						Flattering, crooked minds,

						Who claim to have gained what they have not,

						Have minds filled with arrogance.

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 14
				-
					-
						Some may appear to be Aranyakas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 15
				-
					-
						For they wear rags and dwell in the wilds.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 16
				-
					-
						But although they claim to be on the true path,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 17
				-
					-
						They scorn those who live among people.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 18
				-
					-
						Coveting profit and offerings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 19
				-
					-
						They will speak Dharma to the white-robed
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 20
				-
					-
						And be held in reverence by the world
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 21
				-
					-
						As Arhats with the Six Penetrations.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 22
				-
					-
						These people harbor evil thoughts,

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 23
				-
					-
						Always thinking of vulgar, worldly matters.

				-
					-
						Falsely calling themselves Aranyakas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 25
				-
					-
						They will take delight in pointing out our faults,

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 26
				-

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 27
				-
					-
						"All of these Bhikshus
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Are greedy for profit and offerings,"
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 29
				-
					-
						And so they preach externalist doctrines.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 30
				-
					-
						They have written the Sutras themselves
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 31
				-
					-
						To deceive and confuse worldly people
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 32
				-
					-
						All for the sake of reputation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 33
				-
					-
						They will single out this Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 34
				-

						And in the midst of the multitudes

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 35

						Before the kings, ministers, Brahmans, and lay-people

						"These are people of deviant views

					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 41
				-
					-
						Because we revere the Buddha,

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 42
				-
					-
						We will enquire all of this evil.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 43
				-
					-
						For this we will be mocked
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 44

						"All of you are Buddhas."

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 46
				-
					-
						All such words of ridicule
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 47
				-
					-
						We will patiently endure.

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 48
				-
					-
						In the turbid aeon, in the evil age
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 49
				-
					-
						When there will be much to fear,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 50
				-
					-
						Evil ghosts will possess others
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 51
				-
					-
						In order to slander and insult us.

				-
					-
						But, revering and trusting the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 53
				-
					-
						We shall put on the armor of patience;

					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 54
				-
					-
						In order to speak this Sutra,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 55

						We shall endure all these difficulties.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 56
				-

						Not cherishing body or life itself,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 57

						But caring only for the Supreme Path
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 58
				-
					-
						We in the ages to come,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 59
				-
					-
						Will protect and uphold the Buddha's entrustment.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 60
				-
					-
						As the World Honored One himself knows,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 61
				-
					-
						In the turbid age, evil Bhikshus,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 62
				-
					-
						Not knowing of the Buddha's expedients
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 63
				-
					-
						Whereby the Dharma is spoken appropriately,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 64
				-
					-
						Will frown and speak ill of us,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 65
				-
					-
						Repeatedly banishing us
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 66
				-
					-
						From stupas and temples.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 67
				-
					-
						So will be the host of evils,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 68
				-
					-
						And yet, recollecting the Buddha's command,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 69
				-
					-
						We shall bear up under these events.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 70
				-
					-
						If there are those who seek the Dharma,

				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 71
				-
					-
						In the villages, cities, and towns,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 72
				-
					-
						We will go to those places
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 73
				-
					-
						To speak the Dharma entrusted
					-

						To us by the Buddha.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 75

					-
						We are the Buddha's attendants

					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 76
				-
					-
						Dwelling fearlessly among the multitudes,
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 77
				-
					-
						We speak the Dharma skillfully,

					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 78
				-
					-
						And hope the Buddha will remain at peace.
					-
				-
					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 79
				-

						We in the presence of the World Honored One,

					Chapter 13: Verse 14: Line 80
				-

						And before the Buddhas who have come from the ten directions,

				Chapter 14: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME Dharma Prince Manjushri Bodhisattva Mahasattva said to the Buddha,
					"World Honored One, all these Bodhisattvas are extremely rare. Reverently
					complying with the Buddha, they have made great vows to protect, maintain,
					read, and speak this Dharma Flower Sutra in the future evil age.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, how should Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas speak this Sutra in the
					future evil age?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 3
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Manjushri. "If a Bodhisattva Mahasattva wishes to speak this
					Sutra in the future evil age, he should dwell securely in four Dharmas. First,
					by dwelling in the Bodhisattva's range of practice and the Bodhisattva's range
					of association, he will be able to expound this Sutra for living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"Manjushri, what is meant by the Bodhisattva Mahasattva's range of practice? If
					a Bodhisattva Mahasattva dwells on the ground of patience, is gentle and
					compliant, not impetuous or volatile; if his mind is not frightened; if,
					moreover, he does not practice in regard to any dharma, but contemplates the
					marks of all dharmas as they really are-not, however, practicing
					nondiscrimination-that is called the Bodhisattva Mahasattva's range of
					practice.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"What is meant by the Bodhisattva Mahasattva's range of association?
					Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas do not draw near to kings, princes, great ministers,
					or officials.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"They do not draw near to externalists-brahmacharins, nirgranthas, and the
					like-or to writers of worldly literature, to those who sing praises of
					externalist writings, to lokayatas, or to the opponents of lokayatas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"They also do not draw near to violent amusements such as boxing and wrestling,
					to displays of martial arts that involve mutual attack, to natas, or to any
					entertainment that uses magic.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"They do not draw near to chandalas; to those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens,
					or dogs; or to those who hunt, fish, trap, or engage in any other evil
					activities. If such people should on occasion come to them, they speak the
					Dharma for them, but they have no expectations.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"They also do not draw near to those who seek to be Hearers, whether Bhikshus,
					Bhikshunis, Upasakas, or Upasikas, and they do not make a half bow to them.
					They do not remain in a room, a promenade, or a lecture hall with them. Should
					such people sometimes come to them, they speak Dharma as is appropriate, but
					seek nothing in return.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"Manjushri, moreover, Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas must not regard women's bodies
					as objects of desire and speak Dharma for them. They do not take delight in
					looking at women. If they enter the homes of others, they do not speak with
					young girls, maidens, widows, and so forth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Further, they do not draw near to the five kinds of unmanly men or become
					friends with them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"They do not enter others' houses alone. If for some reason they must enter
					alone, they single-mindedly recollect the Buddha.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"If they speak the Dharma for women, they do not smile or laugh and let their
					teeth show, nor do they expose their chests. Even for the sake of the Dharma,
					they do not become familiar with them, much less for the sake of other matters!
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"They take no delight in raising young disciples, Shramaneras, or children, and
					they do not take pleasure in sharing the same Master with them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"They always delight in sitting in dhyana and, in a quiet place, cultivating
					collecting their thoughts. Manjushri, this is called the first range of
					association.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"Further, Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas contemplate all dharmas as empty, as
					characterized by actuality, as not upside-down, as not moving, as not
					retreating, as not turning, as being like empty space, as without a nature, as
					having the path of language cut off, as not coming into being, as not coming
					forth, as not arising, as without a name, as without an appearance, as in
					reality nonexistent, as measureless, as boundless, as unimpeded, and as
					unobstructed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"They exist only because of causes and conditions and are produced from
					inversion. Therefore, it is said that constantly delighting in contemplating
					such characteristics of dharmas is called the second range of association of a
					Bodhisattva."
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate his meaning, spoke the
					following verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						If there is a Bodhisattva,

				-
					-
						Wishes to speak this Sutra,

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 18: Line 5

					-
						And the range of association.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 18: Line 7

				-
					"Whether one is expounding upon the Sutra orally or reading the Sutra itself,

					harbor resentment or jealousy.

			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"Because one skillfully cultivates such peaceful and happy thoughts, he will

					"Further, Manjushri, in the future ending age, when the Dharma is about to

					Sutra should harbor no thoughts of envy, flattery, or deceit. He should also
					not ridicule or malign those who study the Buddha Way, nor should he seek their
					strengths or weaknesses. If there are Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, Upasikas,
					those who seek to be Hearers, Pratyekabuddhas, or those who seek the
					Bodhisattva Way, he should not torment them or cause them to have doubts by
					saying to them, "You are all very far from the Path, and you will never obtain
					the wisdom of all modes. Why not? Because you are careless and lax in the Way."
					Further, he should not frivolously discuss the Dharma for the sake of argument.

					Bodhisattvas of the ten directions. He should speak Dharma in equal measure for
					all living beings. In accord with Dharma, he should speak neither too much nor

				-
					"Manjushri, in the future age, when the Dharma is about to become extinct, it

					heard it, they will uphold it; having upheld it, they will recite it; having
					recited it, they will be able to speak it; having spoken it, they will be able

					"Only the bright pearl on his cowl, that alone, he does not give away. Why not?
					Only the king can wear this pearl on his crown. If he gave it away, the king's
					retinue would surely be greatly astonished.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 36
			-
				-
					"Manjushri, the Tathagata is also like this. Through the use of the powers of
					dhyana samadhi and wisdom, he has gained the country of the Dharma and is king
					of the three realms. Still, the demon kings refuse to submit. The Tathagata's
					generals, the worthy ones and sages, do battle with them. With those who are
					successful, he is delighted. For the four assemblies, he speaks the Sutras,
					causing their hearts to rejoice. He confers upon them the dhyana
					concentrations, the liberations, the lack of outflows, the roots and powers,
					and all the wealth of the Dharma. He further bestows upon them the city of
					Nirvana, telling them that they have attained cessation. He guides their
					thoughts, causing them all to rejoice.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 37
			-
				-
					"But he does not speak the Dharma Flower Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"Manjushri, eventually the wheel-turning king, seeing among his troops those
					who have been greatly successful, is overjoyed and at last gives them the
					incredible pearl, which he has long worn in his topknot and which he would
					never casually give away.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 39
			-
				-
					"So, too, is it with the Tathagata. As the great king of the Dharma within the
					three realms, he uses Dharma to teach and transform all living beings. Seeing
					the army of worthy ones and sages doing battle with the demons of the five
					skandhas, the demons of afflictions, and the demons of death, and being greatly
					successful extinguishing the three poisons, escaping the three realms, and
					rending the nets of the demons, the Tathagata is greatly pleased. He then
					speaks to them the Dharma Flower Sutra, which can lead living beings to
					All-Wisdom, which meets with resentment and disbelief in all the world, and
					which he has never spoken of before.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14: Verse 40
			-
				-
					"Manjushri, the Dharma Flower Sutra is the foremost among the Tathagata's
					teachings. Among all the teachings it is the most profound, and it is only
					bestowed at the very end, just like that bright pearl which the powerful king
					long kept and then gave away. Manjushri, the Dharma Flower Sutra is the secret
					treasury of all the Buddhas, Tathagatas. Among all the Sutras it is the
					highest. In the long night of time it has been guarded and never recklessly
					expounded. Today, for the first time, I am speaking it for you."

				Chapter 14: Verse 41
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 1
				-
					-
						Always practicing patience,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 2

						And being merciful to all,

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 3

						One will then be able to proclaim

				-
					-
						One who upholds this Sutra,

						Should bring forth kindness and compassion

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 8
				-
					-
						For those at home, those who have left home,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 9
				-
					-
						And those who are not Bodhisattvas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 10
				-
					-
						Thinking, "Those who do not hear

					-
						Or believe this Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 12

				-
					-
						When I have gained the Buddha Way
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 14

						I shall use expedients

				-
					-
						So they may abide within it."
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 17
				-
					-
						It is like a powerful

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 18
				-
					-
						Wheel-turning king
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 19

						Villages, cities, and counties.

						Or he may give clothing

						Or various rare treasures,

						Servants or other valuables,

						Giving them joyfully.
					-

						Should there be a hero

				-
					-
						Who can do difficult deeds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 31
				-

						The king will take from his topknot

				-
					-
						The Tathagata is also thus.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 34
				-
					-
						As king of all the Dharmas,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 35
				-
					-
						With patience, great power
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 36

						And the precious store of wisdom,

				-
					-
						With great kindness and compassion,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 38
				-
					-
						He transforms the world according to the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 39
				-
					-
						He sees all people
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 40
				-
					-
						Suffering pain and agony,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 41
				-
					-
						Seeking liberation,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 42
				-
					-
						And battling with the demons.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 43
				-
					-
						For these living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 44
				-

						He speaks various Dharmas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 45
				-
					-
						Using great expedients,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 46
				-
					-
						He teaches them the Sutras.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 47
				-
					-
						Once he knows that living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 48
				-
					-
						Have become strong,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 49
				-
					-
						Then at the very end
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 50
				-
					-
						He speaks the Dharma Flower for them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 51
				-
					-
						This is like the king who unties his topknot
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 52
				-
					-
						And gives away his bright pearl.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 53
				-
					-
						Highest among the host of Sutras,

						This Sutra is venerable.

					-
						I always guard and protect it

						But now the time is exactly right

				-
					-
						And to proclaim this Sutra
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 63
				-

						With a countenance fresh and clear.

				-
					-
						Lowly, or ugly.

						Living beings will be happy to see them,

				-
					-
						All the children of the gods

						Will act as their messengers.

						Poison will not harm them,

					-
						And should someone revile them,

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 78
				-
					-
						His mouth will be stopped.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 79
				-
					-
						They shall roam fearlessly
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 80

						Like the lion king.

						The light of their wisdom

						Will shine like the sun.

					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 83
				-

						In dreams they will see

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 84
				-
					-
						Only wonderful things.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 85
				-
					-
						They may see the Tathagatas
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 86
				-
					-
						Seated on their lion thrones,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 87

						Surrounded by a host of Bhikshus

						Asuras and so forth,

						Reverent, with palms joined.

						Further, they will see all the Buddhas,

				-
					-
						For the realization of the most proper enlightenment,

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 113

						Will listen to the Dharma with palms joined."
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 121

				-
					-
						And always have good dreams like these.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 131
				-
					-
						They will also dream of being a king
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 132
				-
					-
						Who forsakes his palace and retinue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 133

						Seeking the Way for seven days,

				-
					-
						After realizing the supreme Way,

				-
					-
						They rise and turn the Dharma wheel
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 141
				-
					-
						And speak the Dharma for the fourfold host.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 142
				-
					-
						Throughout thousands of myriads of millions of eons,

				-

						They speak the nonoutflow wondrous Dharma,

				-
					-
						And save limitless living beings.
					-
				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 145
				-

						Later they enter Nirvana,

				-
					Chapter 14: Verse 41: Line 146
				-

						As a lamp goes out when its fuel is gone.

				Chapter 15: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME, in the great assembly, the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas, who had come
					from other lands in numbers exceeding the grains of sand in eight Ganges
					Rivers, rose, placed their palms together, made obeisance, and said to the
					Buddha, "World Honored One, if you will allow us, after the Buddha's
					Quiescence, here in this Saha World we will with ever-increasing vigor protect,
					maintain, read, recite, write out, and make offerings to this Sutra, and we
					will proclaim it far and wide throughout this land."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 2
			-
				-
					The Buddha then told the host of Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas, "Stop! Good men, you
					do not need to protect and maintain this Sutra. Why not? Within my Saha World
					itself there are Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas equal in number to the sands of sixty
					thousand Ganges Rivers, each of whom has a retinue equal in number to the sands
					of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. After my quiescence, all of them will protect,
					uphold, read, recite, and vastly proclaim this Sutra."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Just as the Buddha said this, the earth in the three thousand great thousand
					lands in the Saha World trembled and split open, and from its midst limitless
					thousands of tens of thousands of millions of Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas
					simultaneously welled forth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 4
			-
				-
					All of these Bodhisattvas possessed golden-hued bodies, the thirty-two marks,
					and limitless light.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 5
			-
				-
					They had been dwelling beneath the Saha World in the space belonging to this
					world.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Upon hearing the sound of Shakyamuni Buddha's voice, all the Bodhisattvas came
					up from below.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Each one of the Bodhisattvas was a leader who instructed and guided a great
					multitude. Each had a retinue numbering as many as the sand grains of sixty
					thousand Ganges Rivers. Still others had retinues numbering as many as the sand
					grains of fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or
					ten thousand Ganges Rivers. Others had retinues numbering as many as the sand
					grains of one Ganges River, one half a Ganges River, one fourth, and on down to
					one thousandth of a ten thousandth of a millionth of a nayuta of a Ganges
					River.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Others had retinues numbering in the billions of nayutas. Others had retinues
					numbering in the hundreds of millions. Others had retinues numbering in the
					tens of millions, the millions, and on down to the tens of thousands. Others
					had a thousand or a hundred and on down to ten. Others had five, four, three,
					or two disciples, down to one disciple. Still others came alone, preferring
					isolation. And so it was that their numbers were limitless and boundless,
					beyond the power of calculation or analogy to make known.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Having welled forth from the earth, all the Bodhisattvas went to the Wonderful
					Stupa of Seven Jewels in space, where the Thus Come One Many Jewels and
					Shakyamuni Buddha were. Arriving there, they turned toward the two World
					Honored Ones and bowed with their heads at those Buddhas' feet. They went on to
					where all the Buddhas were seated on lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, bowed
					to them, circumambulated them three times to the right, put their palms
					together respectfully, and praised them with various Bodhisattva praises. Then
					they withdrew to one side and gazed joyfully at the two World Honored Ones.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 10
			-
				-
					From the time the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas first welled forth from the earth,
					and while they praised the Buddhas with various Bodhisattva praises, a period
					of fifty small eons elapsed. During that time, Shakyamuni Buddha remained
					seated in silence, and the four assemblies were silent for fifty small eons as
					well.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Because of the Buddha's spiritual power, all in the great assembly thought only
					half a day had passed. At that time the four assemblies were also able, because
					of the Buddha's spiritual power, to see all the Bodhisattvas completely filling
					the space of limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of lands.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 12
			-
				-
					Among the multitudes of Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas were four leaders. The first
					was named Superior Practice, the second was named Boundless Practice, the third
					was named Pure Practice, and the fourth was named Secure Practice. These four
					Bodhisattvas, among the assembly, were the foremost leaders, the spokesmen and
					guides. Before the great multitudes, they joined their palms together,
					contemplated Shakyamuni Buddha, made deep bows from the waist and said, "World
					Honored One, are you in good health and free from worry? Are you peaceful and
					happy in your practice? Are those who should be crossed over receptive to the
					teaching? They do not cause the World Honored One any weariness, do they?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 13
			-
				-
					The four Great Bodhisattvas then spoke verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 1
				-
					-
						Is the World Honored One happy and at peace,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 2
				-
					-
						Free from worry and disease?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 3
				-
					-
						In teaching and transforming beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 4
				-
					-
						Is he free from weariness?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 5
				-
					-
						And further, do living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 6
				-
					-
						Receive transformation easily?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 7
				-
					-
						They do not cause the World Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 13: Line 8
				-
					-
						To become fatigued, do they?
					-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 14
			-
				-
					The World Honored One then, in the midst of the great host of Bodhisattvas,
					said this: "So it is, so it is, good men. The Thus Come One is peaceful and
					happy, free from disease and worry. All the living beings are easy to transform
					and take across, and they do not cause me weariness. Why is this? All these
					living beings, in lifetime after lifetime, have always received my teaching,
					and they have also paid reverence to and venerated the Buddhas of the past,
					thereby planting the roots of goodness. When these living beings first saw me
					and heard my teaching, all, except for those who had formerly cultivated and
					studied the Small Vehicle, immediately believed and accepted it and entered the
					Thus Come One's wisdom. I now lead even such people as these to hear this Sutra
					and to enter the Buddha's wisdom."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time the Great Bodhisattvas spoke these verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 1
				-
					-
						Good indeed, good indeed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 2
				-
					-
						Great Hero, World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 3
				-
					-
						That all the living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 4
				-
					-
						Are easy to transform and save,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 5
				-
					-
						That they can ask about the Buddha's deep wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 6
				-
					-
						And, having heard it, believe and practice it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 15: Line 7
				-
					-
						We all rejoice accordingly.
					-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Then the World Honored One praised the leaders of all those Great Bodhisattvas:
					"Good indeed, good indeed, that you good men have brought forth a heart of
					rejoicing in accord with the Thus Come One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 17
			-
				-
					At that time Maitreya Bodhisattva and the Bodhisattvas in the multitudes,
					numbering as many as the sand grains in eight thousand Ganges Rivers, all had
					this thought: "From of old, we have never seen or heard of these great
					Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas who have welled forth from the earth and who are
					standing before the World Honored One, joining their palms, making offerings,
					bowing from the waist, and inquiring after his welfare."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 18
			-
				-
					Then Maitreya Bodhisattva Mahasattva, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the
					Bodhisattvas and others, numbering as many as the sand grains in eight thousand
					Ganges Rivers, and wishing as well to resolve his own doubts, placed his palms
					together, faced the Buddha, and spoke verses.
				-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						These limitless thousands of myriads of kotis of
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						Bodhisattvas form a great host,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						Such as we have never seen before.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						We pray the Doubly Complete Honored One
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 5
				-
					-
						Will tell us where they came from
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 6
				-
					-
						And why they are gathered here.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 7
				-
					-
						They have huge bodies, great spiritual penetrations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 8
				-
					-
						And inconceivable wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 9
				-
					-
						They are solid in resolve and will,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 10
				-
					-
						And possess the great power of patience.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 11
				-
					-
						Living beings delight in seeing them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 12
				-
					-
						But where did they come from?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 13
				-
					-
						Each and every Bodhisattva
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 14
				-
					-
						Has brought a retinue
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 15
				-
					-
						Limitless in number,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 16
				-
					-
						Like the Ganges sand grains.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 17
				-
					-
						Some of the Great Bodhisattvas
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 18
				-
					-
						Lead retinues of beings as many as
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 19
				-
					-
						The sand grains in sixty thousand Ganges Rivers.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 20
				-
					-
						Such are the great assemblies
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 21
				-
					-
						Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 22
				-
					-
						These Great Masters,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 23
				-
					-
						In number like the sand grains in sixty thousand Ganges Rivers,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 24
				-
					-
						Have all come to make offerings to the Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 25
				-
					-
						And to protect and uphold this Sutra.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 26
				-
					-
						Those with retinues comprised of as many as the sand grains in fifty
						thousand Ganges Rivers
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 27
				-
					-
						Are even more in number.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 28
				-
					-
						Those with retinues numbering forty, or thirty thousand,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 29
				-
					-
						Twenty, down to ten thousand,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 30
				-
					-
						One thousand, one hundred,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 31
				-
					-
						And so forth, down to the sand grains of a single Ganges River,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 32
				-
					-
						And those with a half, a third, or a quarter thereof,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 33
				-
					-
						Down to one ten thousandth of a millionth thereof
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 34
				-
					-
						Or one thousandth of a ten thousandth of a nayuta thereof,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 35
				-
					-
						And the ones with tens of thousands of millions of disciples, on down to
						half a million,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 36
				-
					-
						Are even more numerous.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 37
				-
					-
						There are also those with hundreds of tens of thousands, or tens of

					-
						Thousands, or hundreds,

				-
					-
						Down to three, two, or one,

				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 41
				-
					-
						And those who come alone without a retinue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 42
				-
					-
						Preferring isolation' All these come before the Buddha
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 43
				-
					-
						In numbers surpassing those just stated.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 44
				-
					-
						So large is the assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 45
				-
					-
						That were one to count them
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 46
				-
					-
						For eons numbering more than Ganges sand grains,

				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 47
				-
					-
						Still one could not fully know them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 48
				-
					-
						Who spoke the Dharma for
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 49
				-
					-
						All these of great awesome virtue -
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 50
				-
					-
						This vigorous host of Bodhisattvas -
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 51
				-
					-
						Teaching, transforming, and bringing them to accomplishment?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 52
				-
					-
						Under whom did they first bring forth their resolve?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 53
				-
					-
						Whose Buddhadharma do they praise and proclaim?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 54
				-
					-
						Whose sutras do they receive, uphold, and practice?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 55
				-
					-
						And which Buddha's Way do they cultivate?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 56
				-
					-
						Such are the Bodhisattvas' powers
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 57
				-
					-
						Of spiritual penetrations and great wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 58
				-
					-
						That throughout the four directions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 59
				-
					-
						The earth quakes and splits open,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 60
				-

						And they rise out of it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 61
				-
					-
						World Honored One,from of old,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 62
				-
					-
						I have never seen such a thing.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 63
				-
					-
						Pray tell us the names
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 64
				-
					-
						Of the countries they come from.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 65
				-
					-
						I am always roaming through the lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 66
				-
					-
						But I have never seen this assembly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 67
				-
					-
						I do not recognize
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 68
				-
					-
						A single one of them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 69
				-
					-
						Suddenly they have welled forth from the earth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 70
				-
					-
						Pray explain the reason why.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 71
				-
					-
						Now in this great assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 72
				-
					-
						The limitless hundreds of thousands of millions
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 73
				-
					-
						Of Bodhisattvas all
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 74
				-
					-
						Wish to understand this event:
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 75
				-
					-
						The causes and conditions, first to last,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 76
				-
					-
						Of this host of Bodhisattvas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 77
				-
					-
						O World Honored One of limitless virtue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 18: Line 78
				-
					-
						We only pray you will resolve the assembly's doubts.
					-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 19
			-
				-
					At that time all the division bodies of Shakyamuni Buddha, who had come from
					limitless thousands of myriads of kotis of lands in other directions, sat in
					lotus posture on lion thrones beneath jeweled trees throughout the eight
					directions. The attendants of those Buddhas, seeing this great assembly of
					Bodhisattvas of the three thousand great thousand worlds welling forth from the
					earth in the four directions and dwelling in space, each said to his respective
					Buddha, "World Honored One, where have all the limitless, boundless asamkhyeyas
					of Bodhisattvas in this great host come from?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Each of those Buddhas then told his attendants, "All of you good men, just wait
					one moment! There is a Bodhisattva Mahasattva named Maitreya, upon whom
					Shakyamuni Buddha has bestowed a prediction that he shall be the next Buddha.
					He has already asked about this matter, and the Buddha is about to answer him.
					For this reason, you may all hear about it."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 21
			-
				-
					Shakyamuni Buddha then said to Maitreya Bodhisattva, "Good indeed, good indeed,
					Ajita, that you can ask the Buddha about such a great matter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"You should all single-mindedly don the armor of vigor and bring forth a firm
					resolve.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 23
			-
				-
					"The Thus Come One now wishes to disclose and proclaim the wisdom of all
					Buddhas, the power of all Buddhas' sovereignty and spiritual penetrations, the
					power of all Buddhas' lion sprint, and the power of all Buddhas' awesome
					courage and mighty strength."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 24
			-
				-
					At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate these principles, spoke
					verses:
				-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 1
				-
					-
						You should be vigorous and single-minded,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 2
				-
					-
						For I wish to speak about this matter.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 3
				-
					-
						Hold no doubts or regrets.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 4
				-
					-
						The wisdom of the Buddhas is inconceivable
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 5
				-
					-
						Bring forth, now, the power of faith,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 6
				-
					-
						And abide in patience and goodness,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 7
				-
					-
						For the Dharma which from of old has never been heard,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 8
				-
					-
						You are now about to hear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 9
				-
					-
						I am comforting you now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 10
				-
					-
						So have no doubt or fear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 11
				-
					-
						The Buddhas never speak falsely,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 12
				-
					-
						And their wisdom cannot be measured.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 13
				-
					-
						That foremost Dharma they have gained
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 14
				-
					-
						Is extremely profound, beyond discerning.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 15
				-
					-
						As such, it should now be explained,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 24: Line 16
				-
					-
						And you should single-mindedly listen.
					-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 25
			-
				-
					The World Honored One, having recited those verses, then said to Maitreya
					Bodhisattva, "In this great assembly, I now make this announcement to all of
					you: Ajita! These incalculable asamkhyeyas of great Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas,
					who have welled forth from the earth and whom you have never seen before, are
					those whom I taught, transformed, and guided in this Saha World after I
					attained anuttarasamyaksambodhi. I tamed and subdued the minds of these
					Bodhisattvas, causing them to bring forth the resolve for the Way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"All of these Bodhisattvas live in the space beneath the Saha World. They have
					read and recited all the Sutras until they have penetrated them thoroughly.
					They have pondered their meanings in detail and have been properly mindful of
					them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 27
			-
				-
					"Ajita! All these good men take no delight in dwelling with the multitudes or
					in much talk. They always enjoy living in quiet places where they practice with
					diligence and vigor, never resting. They do not take up residence with humans
					or gods.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 28
			-
				-
					"They always delight in deep wisdom and have no obstacles. They also always
					delight in the Dharmas of all Buddhas. With single-minded vigor they seek
					supreme wisdom."
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 29
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke
					verses, saying:
				-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 1
				-
					-
						Ajita, you should know,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 2

					-
						For countless eons,

				-
					-
						All these Great Bodhisattvas

				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 4
				-
					-
						Have cultivated and practiced the Buddhas' wisdom.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 5
				-
					-
						I taught them all,

				-
					-
						Causing them to bring forth the great resolve for the Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 7

						Renounce the bustle of crowds,

						These disciples

						They seek the Buddha Way.

				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 25
				-
					-
						I realized the most proper enlightenment
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 26
				-
					-
						And turned the supreme Dharma-wheel.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 27
				-
					-
						Only then did I teach and transform them,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 28
				-
					-
						Causing them first to bring forth the resolve for the Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 29
				-
					-
						Now they all dwell in irreversibility,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 30
				-
					-
						And shall all become Buddhas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 31
				-
					-
						I now speak the truth;
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 32
				-
					-
						You should believe it with a single mind.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 33
				-
					-
						For endless eons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 29: Line 34
				-
					-
						I have taught and transformed these multitudes.
					-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 30
			-
				-
					At that time Maitreya Bodhisattva Mahasattva and the countless Bodhisattvas
					gave rise to doubts in their minds. Puzzling over this unprecedented
					occurrence, they thought, "How could the World Honored One, in such a short
					space of time, have taught and transformed such limitless, boundless,
					asamkhyeyas of Great Bodhis4tvas and caused them to dwell in
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 31
			-
				-
					Just then they spoke to the Buddha, saying, "World Honored One, when the Thus
					Come One was a crown prince, he left the Shakya palace and went to a place not
					far from the city of Gaya where he sat in the Bodhimanda and realized
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi. From that time until now, only forty-some years have
					elapsed. How, in such a short space of time, could the World Honored One have
					done such great Buddha work'using the Buddha's mighty power and the Buddha's
					merit and virtue to teach and transform such limitless hosts of Great
					Bodhisattvas so that they can realize anuttarasamyaksambodhi?
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, the multitudes of Great Bodhisattvas are such that if a
					person were to try to count them throughout thousands of myriads of millions of
					eons, he could not finish or reach their limit. For endless eons in the
					presence of limitless, boundless numbers of Buddhas, they have planted good
					roots and accomplished the Bodhisattva Way, always cultivating Brahma conduct.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 33
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, a matter such as this is hard for those in the world to
					believe.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 34
			-
				-
					"It is as if, by way of analogy, there were a handsome man, twenty-five years
					old and with shiny black hair, who pointed to hundred-year-old men and said,
					'These are my sons.' Then suppose the hundred-year-old men pointed to that
					young man and said, 'He is our father, the one who begot and reared us.' Such a
					thing would be hard to believe.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 35
			-
				-
					"The Buddha is also like this. It has really not been long since he attained
					the Way. On the other hand, the great hosts of Bodhisattvas have already,
					throughout limitless thousands of myriads of millions of eons, practiced with
					diligence and vigor for the sake of the Buddha Way. They are well able to
					enter, leave, and dwell in limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of
					millions of samadhis. They have attained great spiritual powers and have long
					cultivated Brahma conduct. They are well able to practice in succession all
					wholesome dharmas, and their questions and answers are clever. They are jewels
					among humankind, extremely rare in the world. Yet, just now, the World Honored
					One said that only when the Buddha attained the Way did he cause them to first
					bring forth the resolve. By teaching, transforming, and guiding them, he led
					them toward anuttarasam yaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 36
			-
				-
					It has not been long since the World Honored One attained Buddhahood, and yet
					he has been able to do these great and meritorious deeds!
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 37
			-
				-
					"We believe that the Buddha speaks in accord with what is appropriate, that the
					Buddha has never spoken falsely, that the Buddha's understanding is complete
					and penetrating.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"However, when Bodhisattvas who have just brought forth the resolve hear these
					words after the Buddha's Quiescence, they may not believe or accept them. On
					the contrary, they may give rise to the causes and conditions for the offense
					karma incurred in destroying the Dharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 39
			-
				-
					"This being the case, World Honored One, we hope that you will explain in order
					to dispel our doubts, and so that those good people of the future who hear of
					this matter also will not give rise to doubts."

			-
				Chapter 15: Verse 40

					At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke

				-
					-
						In the past, the Buddha of the Shakyan line

				-

						Undefiled by worldly dharmas,

						Like a lotus flower floating on the water,

					Chapter 15: Verse 40: Line 15
				-
					-
						Such a thing is hard to conceive of,

				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 40: Line 16
				-
					-
						How can it be believed?
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 40: Line 17
				-
					-
						The Buddha only recently attained the Way,

				-
					-
						A father so young with sons so old

					-
						Skilled in their ability to distinguish and explain,

				-
					-
						They take no delight in being with the multitudes,

						But always prefer Dhyana concentration.
					-
				-
					Chapter 15: Verse 40: Line 43

						Because they seek the Buddha Way,

						They have been dwelling in the space below.

						Hearing this from the Buddha,

						Give explanations to cause them to understand.

						They would thereupon fall into the evil paths.

						Of these limitless Bodhisattvas

						You have taught and transformed them,

				Chapter 16: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME the Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattvas and the entire great
					assembly, saying, "Good men, you should believe and understand the sincere and
					truthful words of the Thus Come One." Once again he told the great assembly,
					"You should believe and understand the sincere and truthful words of the Thus
					Come One." He again told the great assembly, "You should believe and understand
					the sincere and truthful words of the Thus Come One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Then the great assembly of Bodhisattvas, headed by Maitreya, placed their palms
					together and spoke to the Buddha, saying, "World Honored One we only pray that
					you will speak. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words." They repeated
					this three times.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Again they said, "We only pray that you will speak. We shall believe and accept
					the Buddha's words."
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 4
			-
				-
					At that time the World Honored One, knowing that the Bodhisattvas would not
					stop with three requests, spoke to them, saying, "You should listen
					attentively.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"The Thus Come One's power of spiritual penetrations is acknowledged by all
					gods, humans, and asuras in the world. They say that Shakyamuni Buddha, having
					left the palace of the Shakyan clan and having gone to a place not far from the
					city of Gaya to sit in the Bodhimanda, has now attained anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"However, good men, I actually realized Buddhahood limitless, boundless,
					hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of nayutas of eons ago.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"Suppose a person were to grind into fine motes of dust five hundred thousand
					myriads of kotis of nayutas of asamkhyeyas of three thousand great thousand
					world systems. Then, suppose he traveled to the east across five hundred
					thousand myriads of kotis of nayutas of asamkhyeyas of lands, and there he
					deposited one mote of dust. Suppose he continued in this way, traveling to the
					east, until all the motes of dust were gone.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"Good men, what do you think? Could the number of worlds he passed through be
					reckoned or counted?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Maitreya Bodhisattva and the others all said to the Buddha, "World Honored One,
					those world systems would be limitless, boundless, beyond calculation, and
					beyond the power of the mind to know. All the Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas,
					using their nonoutflow wisdom, could not conceive of them or know their limit
					or number.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"We now dwell on the ground of avaivartika, but we cannot comprehend this
					matter, World Honored One, and so such world systems would be limitless and
					boundless."
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 11
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha spoke to the great hosts of Bodhisattvas, saying, "Good
					men, I shall now explain this clearly for you. If all these world systems
					whether a dust mote was deposited in them or not were reduced to dust motes,
					and if each dust mote were an eon, the time that has passed since I became a
					Buddha would exceed even that by hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of
					nayutas of asamkhyeyas of eons.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"From that time on, I have always remained in the Saha World, speaking the
					Dharma to teach and transform beings. Also, in other places, in hundreds of
					thousands of myriads of kotis of nayutas of asamkhyeyas of lands, I have guided
					and benefited living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"Good men, in that interval, I spoke of the Buddha Dipankara and others, and I
					further spoke of them as entering Nirvana, but those were just discriminations
					made expediently.

			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"Good men, if a living being comes before me, I observe with my Buddha eye his
					faith and other qualities, as well as the keenness or dullness of his

			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"In all places, although the names by which I refer to myself are different and
					I may be older or younger, I also appear and announce that I am about to enter
					Nirvana. I also employ various expedient devices, speaking the subtle and
					wonderful Dharma and enabling living beings to bring forth happiness in their
					minds.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"Good men, the Thus Come One, seeing living beings delighting in lesser
					dharmas, beings of scanty virtue and heavy defilements, speaks for these
					people, saying, 'When young, I left the home-life and attained
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi.' In truth, however, I became a Buddha a long time
					before that. I speak in this way merely as an expedient to teach and transform
					living beings and to cause them to enter the Buddha Way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Good men, the Sutras proclaimed by the Thus Come One are all for the purpose
					of saving and liberating living beings. He may speak of his own body, or he may
					speak of someone else's body. He may manifest in his own body, or he may
					manifest in someone else's body. He may manifest his own affairs, or he may
					manifest the affairs of others, but all that he says is true and not false.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"What is the reason for this? The Thus Come One knows and sees the triple realm
					as it really is. There is no birth or death, no retreating or advancing, no
					existence in the world or passage into quiescence. There is no reality or
					unreality, no likenesses or differences. He views the triple realm as not being
					the triple realm. Matters such as these, the Thus Come One clearly sees,
					without mistake or error.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"Living beings have various natures, various desires, various modes of conduct,
					and various ideas, thoughts, and discriminations. Wishing to lead them to
					produce the roots of goodness, he employs divers causes and conditions,
					analogies, and expressions to explain the various dharmas, carrying out the
					Buddha's work without respite.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 20
			-
				-
					"Thus since I realized Buddhahood in the very remote past, my life span has
					been limitless asamkhyeyas of eons, eternal and never extinguished. Good men,
					the life span I realized when formerly practicing the Bodhisattva path has not
					yet been exhausted and is twice that of the above number.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"As I now proclaim that I am about to enter quiescence, I am not really passing
					into quiescence. The Thus Come One uses this passing only as an expedient to
					teach and transform living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"For what reason? If the Buddha were to stay in the world a long time, those of
					scanty virtue who do not plant good roots, who are poor and lowly, who covet
					the objects of the five desires, and who are caught in the net of schemes and
					false views, seeing the Thus Come One constantly present and not entering
					stillness, would become arrogant, lax, and indifferent. They would not consider
					how difficult it is to encounter him, nor would their hearts be reverent.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 23
			-
				-
					"For these reasons, the Thus Come One expediently says, 'Bhikshus, you should
					know that it is difficult to meet with a Buddha appearing in the world.' What
					is the reason? Those of scant virtue may pass through limitless hundreds of
					thousands of myriads of kotis of eons, during which time they may or may not
					see a Buddha. Because of that, I tell them, 'Bhikshus, the Thus Come One is
					difficult to get to see.' These living beings, hearing such words, will
					necessarily realize how difficult it is to get to encounter the Buddha and will
					cherish a longing for him. They will then plant good roots. That is why the
					Thus Come One, although he does not enter stillness, speaks of quiescence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 24
			-
				-
					"Further, good men, the Dharma of all Buddhas, Thus Come Ones, is like this and
					is used to save living beings. It is entirely true and not false.

				Chapter 16: Verse 25
			-
				-
					"It is as if there were a good physician, wise and well versed in the medical
					arts and intelligent, who is skillful at healing the multitude of sicknesses.

					business, he travels to a far-off country.

				-
					"Although the others who have lost their senses rejoice in their father's
					arrival, have inquired after his well-being, and have sought to be cured of

					and so they say that the medicine of good color and aroma is not good.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"The father then thinks, 'How pitiful these children are! The poison has
					confused their minds. Although they rejoice to see me and ask me to rescue and

					"Immediately he says, 'You should know that I am now old and weak, and my time

			-

					Constantly grieving, their minds then become awakened. They understand that the

					-
						From the time I attained Buddhahood,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 2
				-
					-
						The eons that have passed
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 3
				-
					-
						Are limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 4
				-
					-
						Of kotis of asamkhyeyas in number.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 5
				-
					-
						I always speak the Dharma to teach and transform
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 6
				-
					-
						Countless millions of living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 7
				-
					-
						So they enter the Buddha Way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 8
				-
					-
						And throughout these limitless eons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 9
				-
					-
						In order to save living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 10
				-
					-
						I expediently manifest Nirvana.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 11
				-
					-
						But in truth I do not pass into quiescence.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 12
				-
					-
						I remain here, always speaking the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 13
				-
					-
						I always stay right here,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 14
				-
					-
						And using the power of spiritual penetrations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 15
				-
					-
						I cause inverted living beings,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 16
				-
					-
						Although near me, not to see me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 17
				-
					-
						The multitudes see me as passing into quiescence.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 18
				-
					-
						They extensively make offerings to my sharira.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 19
				-
					-
						All cherish ardent longing for me,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 20
				-
					-
						And their hearts look up to me in thirst.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 21
				-
					-
						Living beings, then faithful and subdued,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 22
				-
					-
						Straightforward, with compliant minds,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 23
				-
					-
						Single-mindedly wish to see the Buddha,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 24
				-
					-
						Caring not for their very lives.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 25
				-
					-
						At that time I and the Sangha assembly
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 26
				-
					-
						All appear together on Magic Vulture Mountain,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 27
				-
					-
						Where I say to living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 28
				-
					-
						That I am always here and never cease to be.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 29
				-
					-
						But using the power of expedient devices
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 30
				-
					-
						I manifest "ceasing" and "not ceasing" to be.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 31
				-
					-
						For living beings in other lands,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 32
				-
					-
						Reverent, faithful, and aspiring,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 33
				-
					-
						I speak the Unsurpassed Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 34
				-
					-
						But you who do not hear this
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 35
				-
					-
						Think that I have passed into quiescence.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 36
				-
					-
						I see living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 37
				-
					-
						Sunk in misery, and yet
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 38
				-
					-
						I refrain from manifesting for them
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 39
				-
					-
						In order to cause them to look up in thirst,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 40
				-
					-
						Then, when their minds are filled with longing,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 41
				-
					-
						I emerge and speak the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 42
				-
					-
						With such powerful spiritual penetrations,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 43
				-
					-
						Throughout asamkhyeyas of eons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 44
				-
					-
						I remain always on Magic Vulture Mountain
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 45
				-
					-
						And also dwell in other places.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 46
				-
					-
						When beings see the eon ending
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 47
				-
					-
						And ravaged by the great fire,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 48
				-
					-
						My land is peaceful and secure,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 49
				-
					-
						Always filled with gods and humans,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 50
				-
					-
						Gardens and groves, halls and pavilions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 51
				-
					-
						And various precious adornments.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 52
				-
					-
						There are jeweled trees with many flowers and fruits
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 53
				-
					-
						Where living beings roam in delight.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 54
				-
					-
						The gods play celestial drums,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 55
				-
					-
						Always making various kinds of music,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 56
				-
					-
						And mandarava flowers
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 57
				-
					-
						Are scattered on the Buddha and the great assembly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 58
				-
					-
						My Pure Land is not destroyed,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 59
				-
					-
						But the multitudes see it being burned entirely.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 60
				-
					-
						Worried, terrified, and miserable,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 61
				-
					-
						Such ones are everywhere.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 62
				-
					-
						All these beings with offenses,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 63
				-
					-
						Because of their evil karmic causes and conditions,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 64
				-
					-
						Pass through asamkhyeyas of eons,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 65
				-
					-
						Without hearing the name of the Triple Jewel.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 66
				-
					-
						All who have cultivated merit and virtue,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 67
				-
					-
						Who are compliant, agreeable, and honest
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 68
				-
					-
						They all see me
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 69
				-
					-
						Here, speaking the Dharma.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 70
				-
					-
						Sometimes for this assembly,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 71
				-
					-
						I speak of the Buddha's life span as limitless.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 72
				-
					-
						To those who see the Buddha only after long intervals,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 73
				-
					-
						I speak of the Buddha as being difficult to meet.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 74
				-
					-
						The power of my wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 75
				-
					-
						The unlimited illumination of my wisdom
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 76
				-
					-
						Is such that my life span is one of countless eons
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 77
				-
					-
						Attained through long cultivation and work.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 78
				-
					-
						Those of you with wisdom,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 79
				-
					-
						Should not have doubts about this.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 80
				-
					-
						Cut them off entirely and forever,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 81
				-
					-
						For the Buddha's words are real, not false.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 82
				-
					-
						They are like the clever expedients of the physician
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 83
				-
					-
						Who, to cure his insane children,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 84
				-
					-
						Is actually alive, yet says he is dead,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 85
				-
					-
						And none can say that he speaks falsely.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 86
				-
					-
						I, too, am like a father to the world,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 87
				-
					-
						Saving all from suffering and woe.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 88
				-
					-
						But to living beings, inverted as they are,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 89
				-
					-
						I speak of cessation, although I actually remain.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 90
				-
					-
						Otherwise, because they often see me,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 91
				-
					-
						They would grow arrogant and lax.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 92
				-
					-
						Unruly and attached to the five desires,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 93
				-
					-
						They would tumble into the evil paths.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 94
				-
					-
						I am ever aware of living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 95
				-
					-
						Those who practice the Way and those who do not.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 96
				-
					-
						I speak various Dharmas for their sakes
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 97
				-
					-
						To save them in an appropriate manner.
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 98
				-
					-
						I am always thinking,
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 99
				-
					-
						"How can I cause living beings
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 100
				-
					-
						To enter the Unsurpassed Way
					-
				-
					Chapter 16: Verse 39: Line 101
				-
					-
						And to quickly perfect the body of a Buddha?"

				-
					AT THAT TIME, when the assembly heard the Buddha describe the number of eons in
					the length of his life span, limitless, boundless asamkhyeyas of living beings
					gained great benefit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17: Verse 2
			-
				-
					The World Honored One then said to the Bodhisattva Mahasattva Maitreya, "Ajita!
					When I spoke of the great length of the Thus Come One's life span, living
					beings to the number of sand grains in six hundred and eighty myriads of kotis
					of nayutas of Ganges Rivers gained Patience with the Nonproduction of Dharmas.

					As the Buddha proclaimed these great advantages in the Dharma that the
					Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas had attained, there rained from space mandarava
					flowers and mahamandarava flowers, which floated down and settled upon the
					Buddhas seated on lion thrones beneath limitless hundreds of thousands of
					myriads of millions of jeweled trees, as well as upon Shakyamuni Buddha and
					Many Jewels Thus Come One, who had entered Nirvana long ago, both of whom were
					seated on the lion throne within the stupa of seven treasures. The flowers also
					settled upon the great Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly.

			-
				-
					There also rained down finely ground chandana powder and aloeswood incense.
					Heavenly drums in space sounded of themselves, and their wonderful sounds

					garments strung with beads, as well as laces of real pearls, laces of mani
					pearls, and laces of As-You-Will pearls that covered the nine directions.
					Another offering to all in the great assembly was priceless incense burning in
					a multitude of precious censers, so that its scent naturally pervaded the great
					assembly and its surroundings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Above each Buddha were Bodhisattvas holding aloft banners and canopies in a

					At that time the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Mahasattva, "Ajita! If there

				Chapter 17: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"If a good man or a good woman, for the sake of anuttarasamyaksambodhi, were to

						He would dedicate to the Buddha Way.

						"May I gain All-Wisdom

					"How much the more so will this be the case for one who can listen to this

			-
				-
					"Ajita! If a good man or good woman hears of the long duration of the Buddha's

					"Ajita! This good man or good woman need not build stupas or temples for me,

					Why not? This good man or good woman, in receiving, upholding, reading, and
					reciting this Sutra, has already built stupas, erected Sangha dwellings, and
					made offerings to the Sangha. He has built stupas of the seven treasures for
					the Buddha's sharira. The stupas are high and broad, tapering up to the Brahma
					Heavens, hung with banners and canopies. He has also offered many jeweled
					bells, flowers, incense, beads, ground incense, paste incense, and burning
					incense, as well as many drums, musical instruments, pipes, flutes, reeds,

				-
					"...he will thereby have built Sangha dwellings and made thirty-two halls of

					pavilions uncountable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of them
					shall be uncountable in number and shall manifest as an offering before me and
					the Bhikshu Sangha. Therefore I say that after the Thus Come One's entry into
					stillness, if a person receives, upholds, reads, recites, or explains this
					Sutra to others, if he writes it out, asks others to write it out, or makes
					offerings to this Sutra, he need not further build stupas, monasteries, or

					with people, be patient and without anger, and be of solid resolve and
					mindfulness. He may always value sitting in dhyana, obtaining deep
					concentration. He may be vigorous and heroic, gathering in all good dharmas. He

				-

					"Suppose in four million kotis of asamkhyeyas of worlds, among living beings in

					moisture-born, and transformationally born those with form, those without form,
					those with thought, those without thought, those not totally endowed with
					thought, those not totally lacking thought, those without legs, those with two
					legs, those with four legs, those with many legs, and so forth, there is a
					person seeking blessings who gives to them whatever enjoyable things they
					desire, giving each being an entire Jambudvipa full of gold, silver, lapis
					lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, coral, and amber, rare and precious gems,
					as well as elephants, horses, carriages, palaces, and pavilions made of the
					seven treasures.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"This great almsgiver in this way bestows gifts for a full eighty years. Then
					he thinks, 'I have already given living beings these enjoyable things in accord
					with their desires. However, these living beings are old and worn out, over
					eighty years old, with white hair and wrinkled faces. Their time of death is
					not far off. I should instruct them by means of the Buddhadharma.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"He then gathers the beings together and expounds the Dharma to them to
					instruct them, bringing them benefit and delight so that they all at once gain

				Chapter 18: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"What do you think? Would the merit and virtue of this great almsgiver be great

				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Maitreya said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, this person's merit and virtue
					would be extremely great, measureless, and unbounded. If the almsgiver had only
					given the beings all the playthings, his merit and virtue would be unlimited.
					How much the more so would it be if he enabled them to attain the fruit of
					Arhatship!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 9
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Maitreya, "I will now tell you plainly: The merit and virtue
					obtained by this person, who gives playthings to living beings in the six
					destinies in four million kotis of asamkhyeyas of worlds and who further causes
					them to obtain the fruit of Arhatship, does not equal the merit of the fiftieth
					person who hears but a single verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra and rejoices in
					accord with it. His merit does not equal a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a
					hundred thousand myriad millionth part, and so forth until it cannot be known
					by resort to calculation or analogy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"Ajita! The merit and virtue of the fiftieth person who hears in his turn the
					Dharma Flower Sutra and who rejoices in accord with it is limitless, boundless,

					among the first to hear it in the assembly and who rejoices in accord with it.
					That person's blessings are even more supreme, unlimited, unbounded, and
					uncountable beyond comparison.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Further, Ajita, if a person for the sake of this Sutra goes to a Sangha
					dwelling and, whether sitting or standing, hears and accepts it for but an
					instant, by reason of that merit and virtue, in his next rebirth he will
					acquire the finest elephant and horse carriages and jeweled palanquins, and
					will even ride in heavenly palaces.

				Chapter 18: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"Again, if a person is seated in a place where the Dharma is being lectured,

				Chapter 18: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"Ajita! If, further, a person says to another, 'There is a Sutra by the name of

			-
				-
					"For one hundred thousand myriad lifetimes he will never be mute, his breath

					hundred meritorious virtues of the ears, eight hundred meritorious virtues of
					the nose, twelve hundred meritorious virtues of the tongue, eight hundred

					outside the three thousand great thousand world system. In this way he
					distinguishes between all the various sounds, and still his hearing is not

			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME the Buddha told the Bodhisattva Mahasattva Great Strength, "You
					should now know that if someone reviles, abuses, or slanders a Bhikshu,
					Bhikshuni, Upasaka, or Upasika who upholds the Dharma Flower Sutra, he will
					incur great offense retribution as described above. The meritorious virtues
					obtained through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind gained by the
					upholder of the Sutra are also as described above.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, once limitless, boundless, inconceivable asamkhyeyas of eons
					ago, there was a Buddha by the name of King of Awesome Sound Thus Come One, One
					Worthy of Offerings, One of Proper and Pervasive Knowledge, One Perfect in
					Clarity and Conduct, WellGone One, One Who Understands the World, Unsurpassed
					Lord, Regulating Hero, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World Honored One.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"His eon was named 'Apart From Decay.' His country was named 'Great
					Accomplishment.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"In that world, the Buddha King of Awesome Sound spoke the Dharma for the gods,
					humans, and asuras. To those who sought to be Hearers, he spoke the Dharma of
					the Four Truths to take them across birth, old age, sickness, and death to
					ultimate Nirvana. To those who sought to be Pratyekabuddhas, he spoke the
					Dharma of the Twelve Causes and Conditions. For the Bodhisattvas, in order to
					lead them to anuttarasamyaksambodhi, he spoke the Dharma of the Six Paramitas,
					which culminates in Buddha-wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, the Buddha King of Awesome Sound had a life span of eons equal
					in number to the grains of sand in forty myriads of kotis of nayutas of Ganges
					Rivers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"His proper Dharma dwelt in the world for eons equal in number to the motes of
					dust in a single Jambudvipa. The Dharma Image Age dwelt in the world for eons
					equal in number to the motes of dust in one set of four continents. After
					benefiting living beings, he passed into stillness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"After the Proper and Image Dharma had become completely extinct, in this
					country yet another Buddha appeared, also by the name of King of Awesome Sound
					Thus Come One, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Proper and Pervasive Knowledge,
					One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, One Who Understands the
					World, Unsurpassed Lord, Regulating Hero, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha,
					World Honored One. In this way, in sequence, there were twenty thousand kotis
					of Buddhas, all of the same name.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"When the first Thus Come One King of Awesome Sound had passed into stillness,
					and after the extinction of his proper Dharma, during the Dharma Image Age
					there were Bhikshus of overweening pride who assumed great power. At that time.
					there was a Bhikshu-Bodhisattva by the name of Never-Slighting.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, for what reason was he called Never-Slighting? Whomever this
					Bhikshu met, be it a Bhikshu, Bhikshuni, Upasaka, or Upasika, he would bow to
					them all and praise them, saying, 'I deeply respect all of you and dare not
					slight you. Why? You are all practicing the Bodhisattva Path and shall attain
					Buddhahood.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"This Bhikshu did not read and recite Sutras, but specialized in making
					obeisance to the point that when he saw the four assemblies from afar, he would
					approach them, bow, and praise them, saying, 'I dare not slight you, for you
					shall all become Buddhas.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Within the four assemblies, there were some who grew irate, those with impure
					minds who reviled him with foul mouths, saying, 'Where did this senseless
					Bhikshu come from, who says "I dare not slight you" and then gives us
					predictions, saying we shall become Buddhas? We don't need such false
					predictions!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"In this way for many years he was scolded and reviled. But he never got angry.
					He always said, 'You shall become Buddhas.' When he said that, those people
					would beat him with sticks or throw stones at him. He would run off, stand at a
					distance, and shout out, 'I dare not slight you, for you shall all become
					Buddhas!' Because he always said that, the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and
					Upasikas of overweening pride gave him the name 'Never-Slighting.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"When this Bhikshu's life was coming to an end, in space he heard all of the
					complete twenty thousand myriad kotis of verses of the Dharma Flower Sutra
					previously spoken by the Buddha King of Awesome Sound. He was able to receive
					and uphold them all. He immediately obtained the purity of the eye and the
					purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as mentioned above. Having
					obtained the purity of the six senses, his life span was further increased by
					two million kotis of nayutas of years. He extensively spoke the Dharma Flower
					Sutra for others.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"At that time the four assemblies of Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and
					Upasikas of overweening pride who had ridiculed him and named him
					Never-Slighting saw that he had gained great powers of spiritual penetrations,
					the power of the eloquence of delight in speech, and the power of great
					wholesome silence. Hearing what he said, they faithfully submitted to him and
					followed him. This Bodhisattva further transformed thousands of myriads of
					kotis of multitudes, causing them to dwell in anuttarasamyaksambodhi. When his
					life was over, he was able to encounter two thousand kotis of Buddhas, all
					named Brightness of Sun-Moon-Lamp. Within their Dharmas, he spoke the Dharma
					Flower Sutra. By means of these causes and conditions, he further encountered
					two thousand kotis of Buddhas, all named Cloud-like Comfort Lamp King. Within
					the Dharma of those Buddhas, he received, upheld, read, recited, and spoke for
					others of the four assemblies this Sutra, and so obtained the purity of his
					ordinary eye and the purity of his ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. He spoke
					the Dharma in the four assemblies with a heart free of fear.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva Never-Slighting made offerings to

				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 16
			-
				-
					"He later encountered a thousand myriad kotis of Buddhas, and within the Dharma
					of all these Buddhas, he spoke this Sutra. When his merit and virtue were
					realized, he became a Buddha.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, what do you think? At that time, could the Bodhisattva
					Never-Slighting have been anyone else? He was none other than myself! Had I not
					in former lives received, upheld, read, and recited this Sutra and explained it
					to others, I would not have been able to gain anuttarasamyaksambodhi so
					quickly. Because in the presence of former Buddhas I received, upheld, read,
					and recited this Sutra and explained it to others, I quickly gained
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, because at that time the four assemblies of Bhikshus,
					Bhikshunis, Upasakas, and Upasikas hatefully reviled me, for two hundred kotis
					of eons they did not encounter a Buddha or hear the Dharma or meet the Sangha.
					For a thousand eons they suffered great torment in the Avici Hell. Having
					received their punishment, they once again encountered Never-Slighting
					Bodhisattva, who taught and transformed them to anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, what do you think? At that time could the four assemblies who
					constantly slighted this Bodhisattva have been anyone else? They were just
					Bhadrapala Bodhisattva and the five hundred Bodhisattvas in this assembly, Lion
					Moon and the five hundred Bhikshus, and Sugatachetana and the five hundred
					Upasakas, all of whom are irreversible from anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20: Verse 20
			-
				-
					"Great Strength, you should know that the Dharma Flower Sutra greatly benefits
					all the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas, causing them to arrive at
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Therefore, after the passing into stillness of the Thus
					Come One all the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas should always receive, uphold, read,
					and recite this Sutra, explain it to others, and write it out."

					AT THAT TIME THE Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas equal in number to the motes of dust
					in a thousand worlds, who had welled forth out of the earth, in the presence of
					the Buddha, single-mindedly, with palms joined, gazed up at the Buddha and
					spoke to him, saying, "World Honored One, after the Buddha's passing, in
					countries where there are division bodies of the Buddha, in places where he.

				-
			-
				Chapter 21: Verse 2
			-
				-
					At that time, in the presence of Manjushri and the others, limitless hundreds
					of thousands of myriads of kotis of Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas who had long
					resided in the Saha world, as well as the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas,
					Upasikas, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras,

					great spiritual powers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 21: Verse 3
			-
				-
					He put forth his vast and long tongue which reached upward to the Brahma
					worlds. From all of his hair pores, he emitted lights of limitless, countless
					colors, all of which pervasively illuminated the worlds of the ten directions.
					In the same way, all the Buddhas seated on lion thrones beneath jeweled trees
					also put forth their vast and long tongues and emitted limitless lights.

			-
				Chapter 21: Verse 4

					When Shakyamuni Buddha and the Buddhas beneath the jeweled trees had manifested

					the Saha world, the limitless, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of

					Shakyamuni Buddha, together with the Thus Come One Many Jewels, seated on the

			-
				-
					They further saw limitless, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of

					having gained what they had never had.
				-

				Chapter 21: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Just then the gods in space called out in a loud voice: "Passing from here

					named Shakyamuni who now, for the sake of all the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas,
					proclaims a Great Vehicle Sutra by the name of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus
					Flower, a Dharma for teaching Bodhisattvas, of whom the Buddha is protective

					offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha."
				-

				Chapter 21: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And then from afar, they scattered all kinds of flowers, incense, beads,

				-
					At that time the Buddha told Superior Conduct and all the great assembly of

				Chapter 22: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME Shakyamuni Buddha rose from his Dharma seat and manifested great
					spiritual power. With his right hand he patted the crowns of limitless
					Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas and said, "Throughout limitless hundreds of thousands
					of myriads of kotis of asamkhyeyas of eons, I have cultivated and practiced the
					rare Dharmas of anuttarasamyaksambodhi I now entrust them to all of you. You
					should, with a single mind, propagate this Dharma, causing it to spread and
					grow extensively."
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 2
			-
				-
					In this way he patted the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas on the crown three times,
					saying, "Throughout limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of
					asamkhyeyas of eons, I have cultivated and practiced the rare Dharmas of
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi I now entrust them to all of you. You should receive,
					uphold, read, recite, and vastly proclaim this Dharma, causing all living
					beings to hear and understand it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"For what reason? The Thus Come One is greatly kind and compassionate, without
					stinginess and without fear. He is able to give living beings the wisdom of the
					Buddha, the wisdom of the Thus Come One, and spontaneous wisdom. The Thus Come
					One is a great giving host to all living beings. You should all accordingly
					study the Dharmas of the Thus Come One and never be stingy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 4
			-
				-
					"In the future, if there is a good man or a good woman who believes in the Thus
					Come One's wisdom, you should expound the Dharma Flower Sutra to that person,
					causing the person to hear and understand and obtain the Buddha's wisdom. If
					there are living beings who do not believe or accept it, you should instruct
					them with another of the profound Dharmas of the Thus Come One, benefiting them
					and causing them to rejoice. If you can do this, you will have already repaid
					the kindness of the Buddhas."
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 5
			-
				-
					When the Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas heard the Buddha's words, profuse joy
					permeated their bodies. With increasing reverence, they bowed their heads,
					placed their palms together, faced the Buddha, and said in unison, "We shall
					reverently carry out the World Honored One's command. Yes, World Honored One,
					pray do not be concerned about this." The assembly of Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas
					spoke in this way three times, saying, "We shall reverently carry out the
					Buddha's command. Yes, World Honored One, pray do not be concerned about this."
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 6
			-
				-
					At that time Shakyamuni Buddha sent the division-body Buddhas of the ten
					directions back to their own lands, saying, "Peace to all of you Buddhas. Let
					the stupa of the Buddha Many Jewels be again as it was."
				-
			-
				Chapter 22: Verse 7
			-
				-
					As he said this, the limitless division-body Buddhas of the ten directions,
					seated on lion thrones beneath jeweled trees; the Buddha Many Jewels; Superior
					Conduct and the limitless asamkhyeyas of Bodhisattvas in the great assembly;
					Shariputra and the other Hearers; as well as the fourfold assembly and all
					those in the world the gods, humans, asuras, and so forth hearing the Buddha's
					words, all rejoiced exceedingly.
				-
		-
			Chapter 23
		-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME THE Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower spoke to the Buddha,
					saying, "World Honored One, how is it that the Bodhisattva Medicine King roams
					throughout the Saha world? World Honored One, Medicine King Bodhisattva has
					undertaken so many hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of nayutas of
					bitter practices, so difficult to practice.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"It would be excellent, World Honored One, if you would please explain a bit.
					On hearing this, all the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas,
					kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, and so forth, and the Bodhisattvas who
					have come from other lands, as well as the assembly of Hearers, will rejoice. "
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 3
			-
				-
					The Buddha then told the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, "Once, as many
					eons ago as there are grains of sand in limitless Ganges Rivers, there was a
					Buddha by the name of Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon, Thus Come
					One, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect
					in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One Who Understands the World, Unsurpassed
					Lord, Regulating Hero, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World Honored One.
					That Buddha had eighty kotis of great Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas and a great
					assembly of Hearers, equal in number to the sand grains in seventy-two Ganges
					Rivers. His life span as a Buddha was forty-two thousand eons. The life spans
					of the Bodhisattvas were the same. In his country there were no women,
					hell-beings, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras, and so forth, and also no
					difficulties. The ground was as level as the palm of one's hand, made of
					vaidurya, adorned with jeweled trees, covered with jeweled nets, and hung with
					beautiful banners. It was surrounded everywhere with precious vases and
					censers. There were terraces made of the seven gems, one terrace for each tree,
					the trees being separated from the terraces by a distance of an arrow's flight.
					Beneath each tree sat Bodhisattvas and Hearers. Upon each of the terraces were
					hundreds of kotis of gods playing heavenly music and singing praises to the
					Buddha as an offering."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 4
			-
				-
					At that time that Buddha, for the sake of the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in
					Seeing, as well as for the host of Bodhisattvas and the host of Hearers, spoke
					the Dharma Flower Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 5
			-
				-
					The Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing enjoyed practicing ascetic
					practices. Within the Dharma of the Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun
					and Moon, he applied himself with vigor, single-mindedly seeking Buddhahood for
					a full twelve thousand years. He then obtained the samadhi of the manifestation
					of all physical forms.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Having obtained this samadhi, his heart rejoiced greatly and he immediately
					thought, "I have obtained the samadhi of the manifestation of all physical
					forms. This is through the power of having heard the Dharma Flower Sutra. I
					should now make an offering to the Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun
					and Moon, and to the Dharma Flower Sutra."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 7
			-
				-
					He then entered that samadhi, and as an offering to the Buddha, he rained down
					mandarava flowers and mahamandarava flowers from space. Finely ground, hard,
					black chandana also filled the sky and descended like clouds. And there rained
					the incense of 'this shore' chandana, six karshas of which are worth the entire
					Saha world, as an offering to the Buddha.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Having made this offering he arose from samadhi. He thought to himself,
					"Although by means of spiritual powers I have made this offering to the Buddha,
					it is not as good as offering my body." He then swallowed incense of many kinds
					chandana, kunduruka, turushka, prikka, aloeswood, and resin incense. He also
					drank the oil of champaka and other flowers for a full twelve hundred years. He
					smeared himself with fragrant oil, and in the presence of the Buddha Virtue
					Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon, he wrapped himself in heavenly jeweled
					robes and poured fragrant oil over himself. Then by means of spiritual
					penetration power and vows, he burned his own body. The light shone everywhere
					throughout worlds in number to the grains of sand in eighty kotis of Ganges
					Rivers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Within them all, the Buddhas simultaneously praised him, saying, "Good indeed!
					Good indeed! Good man, this is true vigor. This is called a true Dharma
					offering to the Thus Come One. Offerings of flowers, incense, beads, burning
					incense, ground incense, paste incense, heavenly cloth, banners, canopies,
					'this shore' chandana incense, and all such offerings of various kinds cannot
					come up to it. If one gave away one's countries, cities, wives, and children,
					that also could not match it. Good man, this is called foremost giving. Among
					all gifts, it is the most honored and most supreme, because it is an offering
					of Dharma to the Thus Come Ones." Having uttered these words, they became
					silent.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 10
			-
				-
					His body burned for twelve hundred years, after which time it was consumed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 11
			-
				-
					When the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing had made this Dharma offering
					and his life had come to an end, he was born again. In the country of the
					Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon, in the household of the
					King Pure Virtue, he was born suddenly by transformation, seated in full lotus.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 12
			-
				-
					He immediately spoke this verse to his father:
				-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 1
				-
					-
						Your Majesty, you should now know:
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 2
				-
					-
						I, cultivating in that place,
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 3
				-
					-
						All at once attained
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 4
				-
					-
						The samadhi of the manifestation of all forms.
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 5
				-
					-
						Diligently practicing great vigor,
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 6
				-
					-
						I renounced the body I cherished
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 7
				-
					-
						As an offering to the World Honored One,
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 12: Line 8
				-
					-
						In order to seek supreme wisdom.
					-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Having spoken this verse, he said to his father, "The Buddha Virtue Pure and
					Bright Like the Sun and Moon is still present from of old. Formerly, after
					making an offering to that Buddha, I gained the dharani of understanding the
					speech of all living beings. I further heard the Dharma Flower Sutra with its
					eight hundred thousand myriads of kotis of nayutas of kankaras, vivaras,
					akshobhyas, and so forth of verses. Great King, I should now return and make
					offerings to this Buddha."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 14
			-
				-
					Just then he sat on a platform made of the seven treasures, rose up into space
					to the height of seven tala trees, went into the Buddha's presence, bowed with
					his head at the Buddha's feet, placed his ten fingers together, and spoke this
					verse in praise of the Buddha:
				-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 14: Line 1
				-
					-
						How amazing and rare the countenance,
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 14: Line 2
				-
					-
						With its light shining in ten directions!
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 14: Line 3
				-
					-
						I formerly made offerings
					-
				-
					Chapter 23: Verse 14: Line 4
				-
					-
						To you whom I now behold once again.
					-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 15
			-
				-
					When the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing had spoken this verse, he
					then spoke to the Buddha, saying, "World Honored One! World Honored One! You
					are still in the world!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 16
			-
				-
					The Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon told the Bodhisattva
					All Beings Delight in Seeing, "Good man, the time of my Parinirvana has
					arrived. The time for my passing into stillness has arrived. You can arrange my
					couch, for tonight I shall enter Parinirvana."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 17
			-
				-
					He further commanded the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing, saying,
					"Good man, I entrust you, all the Bodhisattvas and great disciples, with the
					Buddhadharma and also with the Dharma of anuttarasam yaksambodhi. I also
					entrust to you the worlds of the seven treasures throughout the three thousand
					great thousand world systems, with their jeweled trees, jeweled terraces, and
					gods-in-waiting. After my passing into stillness, I also entrust you with all
					my sharira. You should distribute them and vastly make offerings to them. You
					should build several thousand stupas."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 18
			-
				-
					In this way, the Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon, having
					commanded the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing, in the last watch of
					the night entered Nirvana.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Seeing the Buddha pass into stillness, the Bodhisattva was sorely grieved and
					longed for the Buddha. He then built a pyre of 'this shore' chandana incense as
					an offering to that Buddha's body and set it on fire. When the fire had
					consumed itself, he collected the sharira; made eighty-four thousand jeweled
					urns; and built eighty-four thousand stupas, three worlds in height, adorned
					with poles from which hung banners, canopies, and many jeweled bells.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 20
			-
				-
					The Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing then further thought to himself,
					"Although I have made this offering, my heart is not yet satisfied. I should
					now make further offerings to the sharira." He then spoke to the dragons, the
					yakshas, and so forth in the great assembly, saying, "All of you pay attention
					and bring your thoughts to one, for I am now going to make offerings to the
					sharira of the Buddha Virtue Pure and Bright Like the Sun and Moon." Having
					said that, in front of the eighty-four thousand stupas, as an offering he
					burned his arms, with their adornments of a hundred blessings, for seventy-two
					thousand years, thereby causing countless multitudes of hosts seeking to be
					Hearers and limitless asamkhyeyas of people to bring forth the resolve for
					anuttarasam yaksambodhi, and enabling them to dwell in the samadhi of the
					manifestation of all physical forms.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 21
			-
				-
					At that time all the Bodhisattvas, gods, humans, asuras, and so forth, seeing
					him without arms, were smitten with grief and said, "The Bodhisattva All Beings
					Delight in Seeing is our teacher. He has taught and transformed us, but now his
					arms are burned off and his body deformed."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 22
			-
				-
					Then the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing made this vow amidst the
					great assembly, saying, "Having renounced both of my arms, I should certainly
					attain the Buddha's golden-colored body. If this is true and not false, both of
					my arms should now be restored to as they were before."
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 23
			-
				-
					After he had made this vow, his arms were spontaneously restored. This came
					about through the purity and depth of this Bodhisattva's blessings, virtue, and
					wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 24
			-
				-
					The three thousand great thousand world system then quaked in six ways. The
					heavens rained down jeweled flowers, and all the humans and gods gained what
					they had never had before.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 25
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, "What do you think?
					Was the Bodhisattva All Beings Delight in Seeing anyone else? He was just the
					present Medicine King Bodhisattva. Gifts of his body, such as this one, number
					in the limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of nayutas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"Constellation King Flower! If a person who brings forth the resolve desiring
					to obtain anuttarasam yaksambodhi can burn off a finger or a toe as an offering
					to a Buddha stupa, his offering will surpass that of one who uses as offerings
					countries, cities, wives, and children or even the three thousand great
					thousand worlds with their mountains, forests, rivers, ponds, and precious
					objects.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 27
			-
				-
					"If, further, a person filled the three thousand great thousand world system
					with the seven treasures and offered it to the Buddha, to the great
					Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Arhats, the merit and virtue that person
					would obtain would not be equal to that of one who receives and upholds even a
					single four-line verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra, for the latter's blessings
					are greater by far.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 28
			-
				-
					"Constellation King Flower! Just as, for example, among all the streams,
					rivers, and bodies of water, the ocean is foremost, so, too, among all the
					Sutras spoken by the Thus Come One, the Dharma Flower Sutra is the deepest and
					greatest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 29
			-
				-
					"Further, just as among Earth Mountain, Black Mountain, the Lesser Iron Ring
					Mountain, the Greater Iron Ring Mountain, the Ten Jeweled Mountains, and the
					entire multitude of mountains, Mount Sumeru is foremost, so, too, among all the
					Sutras, the Dharma Flower Sutra is the most supreme.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 30
			-
				-
					"Further, just as among the stars, the Moon God is foremost, so, too, among the
					thousands of myriads of kotis of kinds of Sutra Dharmas, the Dharma Flower
					Sutra shines the brightest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 31
			-
				-
					"Further, just as the Sun God can disperse all darkness, so, too, this Sutra
					can disperse all the darkness of unwholesomeness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"Further, just as among the minor kings, the Wheel-Turning Sage King is
					foremost, so, too, among the Sutras, this Sutra is the most honored.

			-
				-

				Chapter 24: Verse 8

					At that time the Buddha Wisdom of Pure Flower Constellation King told the

					and mountains are filled with filth and evil. The Buddha's body is lowly and
					small. The Bodhisattvas are also small in shape. Your body is forty-two
					thousand yojanas in height. My body is six hundred and eighty myriad yojanas in
					height. Your body is superb and upright, with a hundred thousand myriad
					blessings and fine and subtle light. Therefore, if you go, do not look lightly
					upon that country, its Buddha, Bodhisattvas, or lands."
				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 9

					The Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, I shall

				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Then the Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound, without rising from his seat, his body

					The Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound then disappeared from his own country, and

					The Bodhisattva's eyes were like the broad, large petals of a blue lotus. A
					hundred thousand myriad moons combined would not surpass the awesome beauty of
					his facial features. His body was the color of gold, adorned with limitless
					hundreds of thousands of meritorious virtues. The light of his awesome virtue
					blazed with brilliant splendor, and his marks were all perfect. His body was as
					solid as that of Narayana. He entered a terrace made of the seven treasures,
					and rose up into space to the height of seven tala trees. With Bodhisattvas
					reverently surrounding him, he came to Mount Gridhrakuta in the Saha world.
				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 18
			-
				-
					Having arrived, he stepped down from the terrace of seven treasures. Taking a

					Shakyamuni Buddha, bowed with his head at the Buddha's feet, offered up the
					necklace and said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, the Buddha Wisdom of Pure
					Flower Constellation King inquires after the World Honored One. Are you free
					from sickness and worry? Are you energetic in your comings and goings? Is your
					practice peaceful and happy? Are the four elements in harmony? Are you enduring
					the affairs of the world? Are living beings easy to save, without much greed,
					hatred, stupidity, jealousy, stinginess, or arrogance? None are not filial in
					their behavior toward their parents, are they, or disrespectful toward
					Shramanas, deviant in their views, unwholesome in their thoughts, or not in
					control of the five emotions? World Honored One, have living beings been able
					to conquer the hateful demons? Has the long since passed Thus Come One Many
					Jewels, within the jeweled stupa, come to hear the Dharma?
				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 19

					Shakyamuni Buddha told the Buddha Many Jewels, "The Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound
					wishes to see you."
				-
			-

				-
					The Buddha Many Jewels spoke to Wondrous Sound, saying, "Good indeed! Good

					here."
				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 23
			-
				-
					The Bodhisattva Flower Virtue then spoke to the Buddha, saying, "World Honored
					One, what good roots has the Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound planted, and what
					meritorious virtues has he cultivated that he has these spiritual powers?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 24: Verse 24
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue, "In the past there was a Buddha
					by the name of Clouds and Thunder Sound King, Thus Come One, Arhat,
					Samyaksambuddha. His country was called Manifesting All Worlds. His eon was
					named Delightful to See. For twelve thousand years, the Bodhisattva Wondrous
					Sound made offerings to the Buddha Clouds and Thunder Sound King of a hundred
					thousand kinds of music. He also offered up eighty-four thousand bowls made of
					the seven treasures. As a result of these deeds, he has been born in the
					country of the Buddha Wisdom of Pure Flower Constellation King and now
					possesses these spiritual powers.

					"Flower Virtue, what do you think? Could the Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound who

					know that the merit and virtue of such people will not be small."
				-
			-
				Chapter 25: Verse 52
			-
				-
					When the Buddha had spoken the "Universal Door Chapter," eighty-four thousand
					living beings in the assembly all brought forth the resolve for
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi.

			Chapter 26
		-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME Medicine King Bodhisattva rose from his seat, uncovered his right
					shoulder, placed his palms together, faced the Buddha, and said, "World Honored
					One, if a good man or a good woman can receive and uphold the Dharma Flower
					Sutra, whether reading or reciting it with ease and understanding, or writing
					it out, what blessings will that person gain?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 2
			-
				-
					The Buddha said to Medicine King, "What do you think? If a good man or a good
					woman were to make offerings to Buddhas equal in number to the grains of sand
					in eight million kotis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers, would the blessings he
					gained not be great?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 3
			-
				-
					"Very great, World Honored One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 4
			-
				-
					The Buddha said, "If a good man or a good woman can receive and uphold even a
					single four-line verse of this Sutra, read it, recite it, explain its meaning,
					and cultivate in accord with its teaching, his or her merit and virtue will be
					extremely great."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 5
			-
				-
					At that time Medicine King Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, "World Honored One,
					I shall now give to the speakers of Dharma a dharani mantra for their
					protection."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 6
			-
				-
					He then spoke the mantra, saying:

				-
					"World Honored One, this dharani, this spiritual mantra, has been spoken by
					Buddhas equal in number to the sands of sixty-two kotis of Ganges Rivers. If
					anyone harms this Dharma Master, he will thereby have harmed these Buddhas."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Then Shakyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King Bodhisattva, saying, "Good indeed,
					good indeed, Medicine King, that you mercifully protect this Dharma Master by
					speaking this dharani, thereby greatly benefiting living beings."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 9
			-
				-
					At that time Courageous Giving Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, "World Honored
					One, I too shall speak a dharani to protect those who read, recite, receive,
					and uphold the Dharma Flower Sutra. If this Dharma Master gains this dharani,
					no yaksha, rakshasa, putana, kritya, kumbhanda, or hungry ghost will be able to
					seek out his weakness and take advantage of him."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 10
			-

					Then, in the presence of the Buddha, he spoke this mantra:

				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 12
			-
				-
					At that time the Heavenly King and World-Protector Vaishravana said to the
					Buddha, "World Honored One, I, too, out of compassion for living beings and in
					order to protect the Dharma Masters, shall speak this dharani."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 13
			-
				-
					He then spoke this mantra:

					-
						E li. Nuo li. Nou nuo lu. E nuo lu. Nuo li. Ju nuo li.
					-

					"World Honored One, by means of this spiritual mantra, I protect the Dharma

				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time the Heavenly King "Holder of the Country" was present in the
					assembly and reverently surrounded by a host of a thousand myriad kotis of

				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 16

				Chapter 26: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time there were rakshasa women. The first was named Lamba, the second

					the seventh was named Insatiable, the eighth was named Holder of Beads, the

					unison, saying, "World Honored One, we, too, wish to protect those who read,
					recite, receive, and hold the Dharma Flower Sutra, and keep them from harm.
					Should anyone seek out the weaknesses of these Dharma Masters, he will not be

				-

				Chapter 26: Verse 19

					Then, in the presence of the Buddha, they spoke this mantra:

					"Climb on top of our heads, but do not trouble this Dharma Master. No yaksha,

				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 21
			-
				-
					Then, in the presence of the Buddha, they spoke this verse:
				-
				-
					Chapter 26: Verse 21: Line 1
				-
					-
						If anyone fails to comply with this mantra
					-
				-
					Chapter 26: Verse 21: Line 2

						Or tries to disturb one who speaks the Dharma,

					-
						His head shall break into seven pieces,

				-
					-
						Like the retribution for the offense of killing one's parents,

						Or that of pressing oil,

						Shall incur calamities such as these.
					-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 22
			-
				-
					Having spoken this verse, the rakshasa women said to the Buddha, "World Honored
					One, we, too, shall personally protect those who receive, uphold, read, recite,
					and cultivate this Sutra, causing them to be peaceful and secure, free from all
					harm and illness, and able to neutralize all poisonous potions."
				-
			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 23
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the rakshasa women, "Good indeed, good indeed! In protecting
					those who receive and uphold even the name of the Dharma flower, your blessings
					will be unlimited; how much more so for protecting those who receive and uphold
					it in full; who make offerings to the Sutra text of flowers, incense, beads,
					powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, banners, canopies, and music;
					and who light various lamps-butter lamps, oil lamps, lamps of fragrant oil,
					lamps of sumana oil, lamps of champaka flower oil, lamps of varshika flower
					oil, lamps of utpala flower oil, and lamps such as these, of a hundred thousand
					kinds. Kunti! You and your retinue should protect Dharma Masters such as
					these."

			-
				Chapter 26: Verse 24
			-
				-
					When this "Dharani Chapter" had been spoken, sixty-eight thousand people

				-
		-
			Chapter 27
		-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME the Buddha told the great assembly, "Long ago, in the distant
					past, uncountable, boundless, inconceivable asamkhyeyas of eons ago, there was
					a Buddha by the name of Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom,
					Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha. The name of his country was Adorned by
					Light, and the name of his eon was Delight to Behold.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"Within the Dharma of that Buddha, there was a king by the name of Wonderful
					Adornment. The wife of the king was called Pure Virtue. She had two sons, the
					first named Pure Storehouse, the second named Pure Eye. These two sons had
					mighty spiritual powers, blessings, virtues, and wisdom. They had long
					cultivated the path practiced by the Bodbisattvas dana-paramita,
					shila-paramita, kshanti-paramita, virya-paramita, dhyana-paramita, and
					prajna-paramita; the paramita of skillful means; kindness, compassion, joy, and
					giving as well as the Thirty-seven Dharmas Aiding the Path. They had completely
					understood and penetrated all of these. They had also obtained the
					Bodhisattva's Pure Samadhi; the Samadhi of Sun and Stars; the Samadhi of Pure
					Light; the Samadhi of Pure Form; the Samadhi of Bright and Pure Illumination;
					the Samadhi of Extensive Adornment; and the Samadhi of the Storehouse of Great
					Awesome Virtue. All of these samadhis they had also completely penetrated."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 3
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and also to
					be compassionate towards and mindful of living beings, spoke the Dharma Flower
					Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 4
			-
				-
					The two sons, Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye, went before their mother, placed
					their palms together and said, "We entreat you, Mother, to visit the Buddha
					Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom. We should follow, draw
					near to, make offerings to, and worship him. Why? The Buddha is speaking the
					Dharma Flower Sutra for all the hosts of gods and humans. We should listen to
					it and receive it!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 5
			-
				-
					The mother said to her sons, "Your father believes in an externalist way and is
					deeply attached to the dharmas of Brahmanism. You should ask him if he wants to
					go along."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 6
			-
				-
					With their palms together, Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye said to their mother,
					"We are Dharma Princes, and yet we have been born into this house of deviant
					views!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 7
			-
				-
					The mother replied, "Out of concern for your father, you should manifest
					spiritual transformations. If he sees them, his mind will be purified, and
					perhaps he will permit us to go to the Buddha."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Then, out of concern for their father, the two Sons rose up into Space to the
					height of seven tala trees and manifested various spiritual transformations.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 9
			-
				-
					In space they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From the upper part of their
					bodies, they emitted water; and from the lower part, fire. From the lower part
					of their bodies, they emitted water; and from the upper part, fire. They
					manifested in huge bodies filling up all of space, and then they manifested as
					being small. From being small, they again manifested as being large. In space,
					they disaippeared and then suddenly reappeared on the earth. They entered the
					earth as if it were water, and walked on the water as if it were earth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Manifesting such spiritual transformations of all kinds, they led their
					father's mind to purity, belief, and understanding.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Seeing his sons' spiritual powers, the father rejoiced greatly and gained what
					he had never experienced before. Placing his palms together, he said to his
					sons, "Who is your Master? Whose disciples are you?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 12
			-
				-
					The two sons said, "Your Majesty! He is the Buddha Cloud Thunder Sound
					Constellation King Flower Wisdom. He now sits on the Dharma seat beneath the
					seven treasures Bodhi tree proclaiming the Dharma Flower Sutra for all the
					hosts of gods and humans. He is our teacher; we are his disciples."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 13
			-
				-
					The father said to his sons, "I now also wish to meet your Master. Let us go
					there together!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 14
			-
				-
					The two sons then came down from space, went to their mother, and with their
					palms joined, said, "Our father, the king, now believes and understands. He has
					been able to bring forth the resolve for anuttarasam yaksambodhi. For the sake
					of our father, we have carried out the Buddha's work. We pray, Mother, that you
					will give us permission to leave the home-life and cultivate the Way under that
					Buddha's guidance."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 15
			-
				-
					At that time the two sons, wishing to restate their intention, spoke verses to
					their mother, saying,
				-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 1
				-
					-
						We pray our mother will let us go
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 2
				-
					-
						Leave the home-life and become Shramanas.
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 3
				-
					-
						The Buddhas are extremely hard to meet,
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 4
				-
					-
						And we will follow the Buddha in study.
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 5
				-
					-
						As rare as the udumbara flower,
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 6
				-
					-
						And harder to meet, is the Buddha;
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 7
				-
					-
						It's difficult, too, to cast off difficulty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 27: Verse 15: Line 8
				-
					-
						So please let us leave the home-life!
					-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 16
			-
				-
					The mother then said, "I permit you to leave home. Why? Because the Buddhas are
					difficult to get to encounter."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 17
			-
				-
					The two sons then said to their parents, "Good indeed, Father and Mother! It is
					time, if you please, to go to the Buddha Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King
					Flower Wisdom, to draw near to him and make offerings. Why is this? The Buddhas
					are as difficult to meet as the udumbara flower. It is also as difficult as it
					would be for a one-eyed tortoise to meet with a hole in a floating log. But our
					blessings from former lives are deep and thick, and so in this life we have
					encountered the Buddhadharma. Therefore, Father and Mother, hear us and allow
					us to leave the home-life. Why? The Buddhas are difficult to get to meet, and
					such a time is hard to encounter."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 18
			-
				-
					At that time eighty-four thousand women in the palace of King Wonderful
					Adornment all became capable of receiving and upholding the Dharma Flower
					Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 19
			-
				-
					The Bodhisattva Pure Eye had already long ago penetrated the Samadhi of the
					Dharma Flower. The Bodhisattva Pure Storehouse had already, for uncountable
					hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of eons, penetrated the Samadhi of
					Separation from All Evil Destinies, because he wished to cause all living
					beings to leave the evil destinies.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 20
			-
				-
					The king's wife obtained the Samadhi of the Buddha's Accumulation and was able
					to know all the secret treasuries of the Buddhas.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 21
			-
				-
					The two sons, using the power of such expedients, skillfully taught their
					father, leading his mind to belief and understanding, and causing him to take
					delight in the Buddhadharma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 22
			-
				-
					Then, King Wonderful Adornment, together with his assembled ministers and
					retinue; Queen Pure Virtue, together with her maidservants and retinue; and the
					king's two sons, together with forty-two thousand people, all went to the
					Buddha. Upon arrival, they bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet,
					circumambulated him three times, and withdrew to one side.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 23
			-
				-
					That Buddha then spoke the Dharma for the king's instruction, bringing him
					benefit and delight, and the king rejoiced greatly.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 24
			-
				-
					Then King Wonderful Adornment and his wife removed their pearl necklaces,
					valued in the hundreds of thousands, and scattered them over the Buddha. In
					space, the necklaces transformed into a jeweled terrace with four pillars. In
					the center of the terrace was a large jeweled couch upon which were spread
					hundreds of thousands of myriads of heavenly garments. And on top of them was a
					Buddha seated in full lotus, emitting great light.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 25
			-
				-
					Then King Wonderful Adornment had this thought, "The Buddha's body is rare,
					upright, splendid, and distinguished."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 26
			-
				-
					The Buddha Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom then told the
					four assemblies, "Do you see King Wonderful Adornment who stands before me with
					his palms joined? This king shall become a Bhikshu within my Dharma. Diligent
					in his cultivation of the Dharmas that Aid the Buddha Way, he shall become a
					Buddha by the name of Sala Tree King. His country shall be called Great Light.
					His eon shall be called Great Lofty King. The Buddha Sala Tree King shall have
					a host of uncountable Bodhisattvas as well as uncountable Hearers. His country
					will be flat and even. Thus shall be his merit and virtue."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 27
			-
				-
					The king then immediately conferred his country upon his younger brother, and
					together with his wife, his two children, and his retinue, left home within the
					Buddhadharma to cultivate the Way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 28
			-
				-
					After leaving the home-life, for eighty-four thousand years the king was always
					diligent and vigorous in his cultivation of the Wonderful Dharma Flower Sutra.
					Afterwards he obtained the Samadhi of the Adornment with All Pure Merit and
					Virtue.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 29
			-
				-
					He immediately rose up into space to the height of seven tala trees and said to
					the Buddha, "World Honored One, my two sons have already done the Buddha's
					work. With spiritual penetrations and transformations, they have turned me away
					from deviant thought and caused me to abide securely within the Buddhadharma
					and to meet with the World Honored One. These two sons are my Good and Wise
					Advisors. Wishing to arouse in me the good roots planted in former lives and to
					benefit me, they came to be born in my household."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 30
			-
				-
					At that time the Buddha Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom
					told King Wonderful Adornment, "So it is, so it is, just as you say. If good
					men or good women have planted good roots, in life after life they may gain a
					Good and Wise Advisor. The Good and Wise Advisor can do the Buddha's work,
					instruct, benefit, and delight them, and cause them to enter
					anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 31
			-
				-
					"Great King, you should know that a Good and Wise Advisor is a great causal
					condition, for he teaches and guides people, and causes them to see the Buddha
					and to bring forth the resolve for anuttarasamyaksambodhi.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 32
			-
				-
					"Great King, do you see these two children? In the past, these two children
					made offerings to Buddhas equal in number to the grains of sand in sixty-five
					hundred thousand myriads of kotis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers, drawing near
					them with reverence. In the presence of those Buddhas, they received and upheld
					the Dharma Flower Sutra. Pitying living beings with deviant views, they led
					them to abide in proper views.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 33
			-
				-
					King Wonderful Adornment then came down from space and said to the Buddha,
					"World Honored One, the Thus Come One is extremely rare. By means of his merit
					and virtue and wisdom, the flesh cowl atop his head dazzles brightly. His eyes
					are long and broad, violet in color. The hair-mark light between his eyebrows
					is as white as the glistening moon. His teeth are white, even, and always
					shining. His lips are a fine red color like the bimba fruit."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 34
			-
				-
					Having thus praised the Buddha for his uncountable hundreds of thousands of
					myriads of kotis of meritorious virtues, King Wonderful Adornment then, in the
					presence of the Thus Come One, single-mindedly placed his palms together and
					further said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, the Thus Come One's Dharma is
					unique, perfect in the accomplishment of inconceivable, subtle, and wonderful
					merit and virtue. His teachings on the practice of morality lead to security,
					joy, and goodness. From this day forward, I shall never again follow the course
					of my own mind. I will never give rise to deviant views, arrogance, anger, or
					any other evil thoughts."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 35
			-
				-
					Having said that, he bowed to the Buddha and left.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 36
			-
				-
					The Buddha told the great assembly, "What do you think? Could King Wonderful
					Adornment have been anyone else? He was just the present Bodhisattva Flower
					Virtue. His wife, Queen Pure Virtue, was just the Bodhisattva Mark of Shining
					Adornment now in the presence of the Buddha, who, out of pity for King
					Wonderful Adornment and his retinue, was born among them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 37
			-
				-
					"The two sons are the present Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva
					Medicine Superior. The Bodhisattva Medicine King and the Bodhisattva Medicine
					Superior have accomplished such great merit and virtue as this. In the presence
					of uncountable hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of Buddhas, they have
					already amassed the roots of virtue and accomplished inconceivable wholesome
					merit and virtue.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 38
			-
				-
					"If a person knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the world with its
					population of gods and humans should do obeisance to him."
				-
			-
				Chapter 27: Verse 39
			-
				-
					When the Buddha spoke this chapter, "The Past Deeds of King Wonderful
					Adornment," eighty-four thousand people were removed from the dust and
					separated from defilement. They obtained the Purity of the Dharma Eye with
					respect to all dharmas.

			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 1
			-
				-
					AT THAT TIME Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, renowned for his comfort, spiritual
					powers, and awesome virtue, came from the east together with uncountable,
					boundless, incalculable great Bodhisattvas. The countries they passed through
					quaked, and jeweled lotuses rained down while uncountable hundreds of thousands
					of myriads of kotis of kinds of music played.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 2
			-
				-
					He was also accompanied by and surrounded by a great host of countless gods,

			-
				-
					Arriving at Mount Gridhrakuta in the Saha world, they bowed in obeisance to
					Shakyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times to the right and said to the
					Buddha, "World Honored One, in the country of the Buddha Superior King of
					Jeweled Awesome Virtue, I heard from afar that in the Saha world, the Dharma
					Flower Sutra was being spoken. I have come with uncountable, boundless hundreds
					of thousands of myriads of kotis of Bodhisattvas to hear and receive it. I only
					pray that the World Honored One will speak it. After the passing of the Thus
					Come One, how is a good man or a good woman to obtain the Dharma Flower Sutra?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 4
			-
				-
					The Buddha told Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, "If a good man or a good woman
					accomplishes the Four Dharmas, he will attain the Dharma Flower Sutra after the
					passing of the Thus Come One. First, he is the object of the Buddha's
					mindfulness and protection. Second, he amasses the roots of virtue. Third, he
					enters the collection of proper concentrations. Fourth, he brings forth the
					mind to rescue all living beings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 5
			-
				-
					"If a good man or a good woman in this way accomplishes these Four Dharmas, he
					is certain to gain this Sutra after the passing of the Thus Come One."
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Universal Worthy Bodhisattva then said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, in
					the last five hundred years, in the turbid, evil world, if there are those who
					receive and uphold this Sutra, I shall protect them, keep them from harm, and
					cause them to be peaceful and secure. No being will be able to take advantage
					of them, be it a demon, a demon son, a demon daughter, a demon subject, or one
					possessed by a demon, a yaksha, rakshasa, kumbhanda, pishacha, kritya, putana,
					vetala, or any tormentor of human beings none shall get at them.

			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"If there is a person reading or reciting this Sutra, whether walking or
					standing, I will at that time mount my royal white elephant with six tusks and
					together with a host of Great Bodhisattvas go to that place, manifest my body,
					make offerings, protect him, and comfort his mind, and also make offerings to
					the Dharma Flower Sutra.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 8
			-
				-
					"Should a person be sitting and pondering over this Sutra, I will at that time
					again mount my royal white elephant and manifest before him. If he should
					forget a line or a verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra, I will teach it to him,
					and read and recite it with him until he becomes fluent. Upon seeing me, the
					one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites the Dharma Flower Sutra will
					rejoice greatly and increase his vigor. Having seen me, he will immediately
					obtain samadhis and dharanis a dharani by the name of Revolution, a dharani of
					a hundred thousand myriad kotis of revolutions, and a dharani of the
					skill-in-means of Dharma sounds. He shall obtain dharanis such as these.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 9
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, if in the last five hundred years, in the turbid evil
					world, there is a Bhikshu, Bhikshuni, Upasaka, or Upasika, who seeks, upholds,
					reads, recites, writes out, or wishes to cultivate the Dharma Flower Sutra, he
					or she should be single-minded and vigorous for twenty-one days. At the end of
					twenty-one days I will mount my white elephant with six tusks, and surrounded
					by uncountable Bodhisattvas, I will appear before that person in a body all
					living beings delight in seeing, and speak the Dharma for him, instructing,
					benefiting, and delighting him. I shall further give him a dharani mantra. Once
					he obtains the dharani mantra, no nonhuman will be able to hurt him, nor will
					he be confused by women. I will also personally protect this person forever. I
					only pray the World Honored One will allow me to speak this dharani mantra."

					Then, in the presence of the Buddha, he spoke this mantra, saying:

			-
				-
					"World Honored One, if there is a Bodhisattva who hears this dharani, you
					should know that it is through the power of the spiritual penetrations of
					Universal Worthy Bodhisattva. If the Dharma Flower Sutra is circulating through
					Jambudvipa, and if a person receives and upholds it, he should bring forth this
					thought, 'This is all through the power of the awesome spirit of Universal
					Worthy Bodhisattva.'
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 12
			-
				-
					"If a person receives, upholds, reads, and recites it, properly recollects it,
					explains its doctrines, and cultivates according to its teachings, you should
					know that he is practicing the conduct of Universal Worthy. He has planted deep
					good roots in the presence of boundless, uncountable Buddhas. His head has been
					rubbed by the hands of the Thus Come Ones.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"If a person merely writes out the Sutra, at the end of his life, he will be
					born in the Trayastrimsha Heaven. At that time eighty-four thousand heavenly
					women will welcome him with all kinds of music. He shall immediately don a cap
					made of seven treasures and enjoy himself among the goddesses. How much the
					more will this be the case for one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites
					it, properly recollects it, explains its doctrines, and cultivates according to
					its teachings! If a person receives, upholds, reads, recites, and explains its
					doctrines, at the end of his life a thousand Buddhas will extend their hands
					toward him, so that he need not fear falling into the evil destinies. He will
					immediately be born in the Tushita Heaven in the presence of Maitreya
					Bodhisattva. Maitreya Bodhisattva has thirty-two marks and is surrounded by a
					host of great Bodhisattvas and a retinue of hundreds of thousands of myriads of
					kotis of goddesses. Being born therein, he shall obtain merit and virtue and
					benefits such as these.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 14
			-
				-
					"Therefore, one with wisdom should single-mindedly write it out himself, employ
					others to write it out, receive, uphold, read, recite, and properly recollect
					it and cultivate in accord with its teachings.

				Chapter 28: Verse 15
			-
				-
					"World Honored One, I now protect this Sutra with my spiritual powers. After
					the passing of the Thus Come One, I shall propagate it widely in Jambudvipa, so
					that it will never be cut off."
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 16
			-
				-
					At that time Shakyamuni Buddha praised him, saying, "Good indeed, good indeed,
					Universal Worthy, that you can protect and aid this Sutra and bestow happiness
					and benefit on many living beings. You have already accomplished inconceivable
					merit and virtue, and deep and great compassion. From the distant past you have
					brought forth the resolve for anuttarasamyaksambodhi and have been able to make
					this vow to protect this Sutra with spiritual penetrations. I shall now use the
					power of spiritual penetrations to protect those who can receive and uphold the
					name of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 17
			-
				-
					"Universal Worthy, if a person can receive and uphold, read, recite, properly
					recollect, cultivate, and write out the Dharma Flower Sutra, you should know
					that this person thereby sees Shakyamuni Buddha. It is as if he had heard this
					Sutra from the Buddha's mouth. You should know that this person has made
					offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha. You should know that the Buddha has praised
					this person, saying, 'Good indeed!'
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 18
			-
				-
					"You should know that this person's head has been rubbed by Shakyamuni Buddha's
					hand, and that he has been covered by Shakyamuni Buddha's robe.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 19
			-
				-
					"A person such as this will never again be attached to worldly pleasures. He
					will never again be fond of the texts or manuscripts of externalist ways, nor
					will he enjoy drawing near such people or other evil people, be they butchers;
					keepers of pigs, sheep, fowl, or dogs; hunters; or panderers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 20
			-
				-
					"This person's mind will be straightforward and his memory proper. He will have
					the power of blessings and virtue. This person will not be tormented by the
					three poisons, nor will he again be tormented by jealousy, arrogance, deviant
					pride, or overweening pride. This person will have few desires and will know
					contentment. He will be able to cultivate the conduct of Universal Worthy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"Universal Worthy, if after the passing of the Thus Come One, in the last five
					hundred years, you see a person who can receive, uphold, read, and recite the
					Dharma Flower Sutra, you should think, 'Before long, this person will go to the
					Way-place and destroy the demon hordes. He will attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi,
					turn the Dharma-wheel, beat upon the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, let
					fall the Dharma rain, and soon sit on the Lion Dharma throne among the great
					hosts of gods and humans.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"Universal Worthy, if in the later age, there is a person who can receive,
					uphold, read, or recite this Sutra, he will never again be greedy for clothing,
					bedding, food, and drink, or any necessities of life. His vows will not be in
					vain, and in his present life he shall obtain the reward of blessings.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 23
			-
				-
					"If one ridicules and slanders this person, saying, 'You're insane! What you
					are doing is useless and will never amount to anything,' his retribution will
					be such that in life after life he will have no eyes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 24
			-
				-
					"If a person makes offerings and gives praise, then in his present life he will
					obtain the fruits of his reward.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 25
			-
				-
					"If, again, one sees a person receiving and upholding this Sutra and then
					speaks of his faults or evils, be they true or untrue, in his present life he
					will contract leprosy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 26
			-
				-
					"If one ridicules him and laughs, then in life after life his teeth will be
					sparse and missing, his lips ugly, his nose flat, his hands and feet contorted,
					his eyes pointed and askew, his body stinking and filthy. He will be covered
					with hideous sores, pus, and blood. His belly will be full of water, or he will
					be short of breath. He will be plagued with all manner of nasty and grave
					illnesses.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 27
			-
				-
					"Therefore, Universal Worthy, if one sees a person who receives and upholds
					this Sutra, one should welcome him from afar and revere him as one would the
					Buddha."
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 28
			-
				-
					When this chapter, "The Encouragement of Universal Worthy," had been spoken,
					uncountable, boundless numbers of Bodhisattvas, as many as the Ganges sands,
					obtained the dharani of a hundred thousand myriad kotis of revolutions.
					Bodhisattvas equal in number to the motes of dust in the three thousand great
					thousand worlds perfected the path of Universal Worthy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28: Verse 29
			-
				-
					When the Buddha had spoken this Sutra, Universal Worthy and all the other
					Bodhisattvas, Shariputra and all the Hearers, as well as the entire great
					assembly of gods, dragons, humans, nonhumans, and so forth, all greatly
					rejoiced, received and upheld the Buddha's words, made obeisance, and withdrew.
