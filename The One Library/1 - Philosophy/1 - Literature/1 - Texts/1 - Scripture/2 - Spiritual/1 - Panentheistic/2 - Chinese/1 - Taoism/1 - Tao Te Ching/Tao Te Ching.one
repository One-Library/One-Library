						-
					-
						Part 1 - Tao Ching: Chapter 27: Verse 1: Line 7

							He is always kind by saving all things and therefore nothing is being

							And by applying the pure simplicity, a saint can master all things.

							What was in front is now behind;

						-
							What warmed anon we freezing find.
						-
					-
						Part 1 - Tao Ching: Chapter 29: Verse 2: Line 4

							Strength is of weakness oft the spoil;

							A man of virtue values the left which is represented by Yang.

							Weapons are instruments of evil, and are not valued by a man of virtue.

							They are only used as the last resort to attain peach when all else

						-
							While on sad occasions, it is favored to the right as represented by

						-
					-
						Part 1 - Tao Ching: Chapter 31: Verse 3: Line 3
					-

							When this rite is applied in the army,

							The lieutenant general takes the place of the left,

						-
							And the commander-in-chief takes the place of the right.
						-
					-
						Part 1 - Tao Ching: Chapter 31: Verse 3: Line 6

							This indicates that war is treated as if it is a funeral service;

						-
							For many lives had been killed and hence should be mourned with sorrow.

							A man of superior virtue is not conscious of being virtuous, hence is

							In the beginning, there were those who attained the Oneness;

					-
						-
							Heaven which by it is bright and pure;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 1: Line 3
					-

							Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;

							If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;

					-
						-
							If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;
						-
					-

						-
							Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 2: Line 5
					-
						-
							Without that life, creatures would pass away;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 2: Line 6
					-
						-
							Princes and kings, without that moral sway,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 2: Line 7

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 3

							Thus, honor is based on humbleness.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							The high builds its foundation upon the low.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							Therefore, the kings and nobles call themselves “the solitude,” “the

						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							Is this not the reason why they base their honor upon humbleness?
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 39: Verse 3: Line 5
					-
						-
							Hence, the highly honored do not regard themselves as nobles and have

							All things in the world originate from the manifestation of Tao,

							When a superior man heard of Tao,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							He cultivates himself diligently.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 1: Line 3

						-
							When an average man heard of Tao,

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 1: Line 4

							He is doubtful, vague and would give up halfway.

							When an inferior man heard of Tao,
						-
					-

							He laughs and thinks of It as foolish.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 1: Line 7
					-
						-
							If Tao is not being laughed at,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 1: Line 8
					-

							It is not the Great Tao.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 2

							Thus, there is a traditional saying of,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;

						-
							Its even way is like a rugged track.

							Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;

					-
						-
							Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;

						-
							And he has most whose lot the least supplies.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 41: Verse 2: Line 8
					-
						-
							Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;
						-

					-
						-
							Its solid truth seems change to undergo;

							Yet the Lords and nobles call themselves these names.

							Hence, things are benefited by being humble, and damaged by profiting.

							What the ancients had taught, I shall also teach as such:

					-
						-
							A man of violence who is in disharmony between Ying and Yang that is
							the physical body and true self, shall die of an unnatural death.

				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 52: Verse 3: Line 1

							To abide by the Mother of Tao is to keep guard on one's sensory desire

							outwards.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 52: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							Thus, by doing so one's whole life may be preserved from exhaustion and

						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 52: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							However, if on the contrary one indulges oneself in the pleasure of

					-
						-
							How do I know that this so?
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							By the following:
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							The more prohibitions that are imposed on people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							The poorer the people become.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 5
					-
						-
							The more sharp weapons the people possess,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 6
					-
						-
							The greater is the chaos in the country.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 7

					-
						-
							The more unusual affairs occur.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 2: Line 9

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 3: Line 6
					-
						-
							I do not exhaust people with labor,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 3: Line 7

							Thus, people naturally are wealthy.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 57: Verse 3: Line 8
					-
						-
							I have no personal desires,
						-
					-

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							The government that seems the most unwise,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Oft goodness to the people best supplies;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							That which is meddling, touching everything,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 4
					-
						-
							Will work but ill, and disappointment bring.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 5
					-
						-
							Calamity is what blessings depend upon.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 6
					-
						-
							In blessings there hides the calamity.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 1: Line 7
					-
						-
							Who knows the ultimate end of the cycle of calamity and blessings?
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Is there no true principle that exists?
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							The normal may revert and become unusual.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							The good may revert and turn into evil.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							Long indeed, man has been under such delusion.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 3
				-

					-
						-
							He is honest and not mean.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 58: Verse 3: Line 3

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 1: Line 2
					-

							There is nothing better than to follow the Way of simplicity.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Simplicity is to restrain one's desires.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							To restrain one's desires is to practice the virtue of Nature Way.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							By practicing the virtue of Nature Way,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							One is capable to accomplish anything.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 5

						-
							With the ability to accomplish anything,
						-

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 6
					-
						-
							One can achieve the infinite realm.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 7
					-
						-
							By achieving the infinite realm,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 2: Line 8
					-
						-
							One can then become a true leader of a nation.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							To govern a nation with the Law of Nature is to be long enduring.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 59: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							This is regarded as a profound and firm foundation of the everlasting
							Tao.
						-
			-
				Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60
			-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ruling a great nation is like frying small fish.
					-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							When they are over stirred, they will break into pieces.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							Guide the world with Tao,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Then the spiritual beings would lose their power.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							It is in fact not that the spiritual beings had lost their power,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 5
					-
						-
							But that their spiritual power cannot harm people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 2: Line 6
					-
						-
							But that the true nature of the saint has harmonized with the spiritual
							power and hence will cause no harm.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							Since they both do not harm each other,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 60: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							Therefore they will harmonize with the true virtue to embrace the
							Oneness, Tao.
						-
			-
				Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61
			-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							A great nation rules by placing itself in a lowly position like the
							rivers that flow into the low regions of ocean.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Hence, people will naturally be faithful to their country.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Mother nature always stays calm and quiet to overcome the unrest.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							It takes the lowly position to be in peace.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							Thus, if a great nation can lower itself to deal with a smaller nation,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							Then it shall win the heart of the people.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							And the smaller nation will willingly merge with the great nation.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							And if the smaller nation can lower itself to deal with the great
							nation,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 5
					-
						-
							Then it shall win the trust and be accommodated as a part of the great
							nation.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 3: Line 6
					-
						-
							Therefore, be it to take a lowly position to win over or to take a
							lowly position to be accommodated;
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 4: Line 1
					-
						-
							The great nation only wishes to unite and shelter all the people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 4: Line 2
					-
						-
							While the small nation only wishes to be a part of the nation to serve
							it.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 4: Line 3
					-
						-
							Now that both are granted with what they wish for,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 61: Verse 4: Line 4
					-
						-
							It is only natural for the “Great” to put itself in a lowly position.
						-

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							Tao has of all things the most honoured place.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							No treasures give good men so rich a grace;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Words of Tao can benefit all people.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							Its action can guide people to follow the right Way.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Those who have gone astray, the all-forgiving Tao will not abandon
							them.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Therefore, it is better to embrace this precious Tao than to be crowned as
						kings or appointed as ministers or to possess wealth and fine horses.
					-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 4: Line 1
					-
						-
							So why did the ancients value and honor this Tao?
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 4: Line 2
					-
						-
							It is because “Those who seek will attain, those who offended will be
							forgiven.”
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 62: Verse 4: Line 3
					-
						-
							Thus, It is the greatest honor in the world.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 1
				-

					-
						-
							Act without personal desire.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Manage without intentional concern.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							Taste without desire of the flavor.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 1: Line 4
					-
						-
							Hold the same regard for big or small, abundant or little and reward
							the unkind with kindness.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Plan for the difficult while it is easy.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							Act upon the great from the beginning of the minute.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							All difficult affairs must be taken care of when they are easy.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							All great accomplishments must be performed from the small tasks.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 2: Line 5
					-
						-
							Hence, a saint does not strive to do something great.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							And as a result he is able to accomplish the great.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							He who makes promises easily seldom keeps his words.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							He who constantly regards things as easy shall result in difficulty.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 63: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							Therefore, the saint is aware of the difficulties ahead and hence is
							cautious in managing affairs while they are sill easy and small to
							prevent resulting into problems.

				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							It is easy to preserve when things are stable.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							It is easy to plan ahead when things have no yet occurred.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							If one waits until the affair has begun,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 4
					-
						-
							Then the situation is as brittle as ice that easily cracks and is
							fragile that easily shatters.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 5
					-
						-
							Take actions before things occur.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 1: Line 6
					-
						-
							Manage before things get out of order.
						-
				-

				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							A huge tree grows from a tiny sprout;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							A nine-story high terrace is built from heaps of earth.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							A journey of thousand miles begins from the first step.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							He who acts with desire shall fail.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							He who tries to possess shall lose.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							Therefore, the saint acts without effort and so he does not fail.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							He is not eager to possess and so he does not lose.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 5
					-
						-
							Most people fail when they are near completion.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 3: Line 6
					-
						-
							If one can be cautious from beginning to end, then he will not fail.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 4: Line 1
					-
						-
							Thus a saint pursues what people do not pursue.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 4: Line 2
					-
						-
							He does not value the hard-to-get objects.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 4: Line 3
					-
						-
							He learns what people do not learn and avoids the faults in order to
							restore his true nature.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 64: Verse 4: Line 4
					-
						-
							He follows the course of nature to benefit all things and dares not go
							astray from the right Way, Tao.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							The ancient Tao cultivators,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Did not lead people to acquire knowledge to be tricky,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							But to guide them to restore their simplicity and innocence.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							The reason people are difficult to be governed is because they are
							clever and witty.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							Therefore, he who rules a nation with tactics and wits shall do harm to
							the country.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							He who does not rule with such is the nation's blessing.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							To know these two principles is to know the rule of nature.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							To know the rule of nature is called Mystic Te (Mystic Virtue).
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							Mystic Te is profound and far-reaching.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							It can guide all things to return to their original nature,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 65: Verse 3: Line 5
					-
						-
							And thus great harmony can be achieved.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							The reason that river and ocean can be the Lords of all valley is
							because they are located in the lowly position.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Therefore, the saint humbles himself to serve all people.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							And he leads the people by putting himself last for the sake of the
							people's welfare.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							Thus, although he rules above the people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							The people do not feel him as a burden.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Although he leads in front of the people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							The people do not feel him as a threat.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							Hence, the world supports him with no objection.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							This is because he does not contend,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 66: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							Therefore, he is above all competition.

							The whole world says the Tao that I have attained is so great that It
							seems unreal.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Because It is indeed so great, thus It seemed unreal.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 1: Line 3

							If It were real, It would have been insignificantly small.

							I have Three Treasures that I hold and guard.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							The first is Kindness.

							The second is Simplicity.
						-
					-

							The third is Humbleness.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							With Kindness, one can be courageous.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							With Simplicity, one can be generous.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							With Humbleness, one can be the lead to provide guidance.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							Now, if one abandons kindness and yet tries to be courageous,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 5
					-
						-
							If one abandons simplicity and yet tries to be generous.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 6

							If one abandons humbleness and yet tries to lead as guidance,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 3: Line 7
					-
						-
							He is doomed to perish.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 67: Verse 4

							One who fights a battle with kindness shall win.
						-

							One who keeps guard with kindness shall secure.

							He who in (Tao's) wars has skill
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Assumes no martial port;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							He who fights with most good will
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 4

							To rage makes no resort.

							He who vanquishes yet still

							Keeps from his foes apart;

					-
						-
							He whose hests men most fulfil
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 8
					-
						-
							Yet humbly plies his art.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 9
					-
						-
							Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 10
					-
						-
							And therein is his might.'
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 11
					-
						-
							Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 12
					-
						-
							That they with him unite.'
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 68: Verse 1: Line 13

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 1
					-
						-
							In warfare, there is a saying of such strategy:
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							I would rather take a defensive position than to make an initial
							offensive move.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							I would rather withdraw a foot than to march forward one inch.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 4
					-
						-
							Such is called to advance without advancement;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 5
					-
						-
							To defeat without arm force;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 6
					-
						-
							To fight as if there were no enemy;
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 1: Line 7
					-
						-
							To carry weapons as if there were no weapons and thus no need for the
							use of weapons.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 2: Line 1

							There is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy.

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							To do so may cost one to lose his valuable life.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 69: Verse 2: Line 3

							Therefore, when two armies engage in a battle,

					-
						-
							My words of Tao is easy to understand and to practice.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							However, the world can neither understand nor practice them.

				-

				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 2: Line 1
					-
						-
							In my words of Tao, there is the subtle truth.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 2: Line 2
					-
						-
							In my deeds, there is the Way of Tao.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Because people do not understand these,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 2: Line 4
					-
						-
							Therefore they do not understand me.
						-
				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							Those who know me are few.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							Hence, the essence of Tao appears to be more honorable and precious.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 3: Line 3
					-
						-
							Thus, a saint may dress in ordinary coarse clothing,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 70: Verse 3: Line 4
					-
						-
							Yet has a heart of gem with the true essence within.

					-
						-
							One who knows what people do not know,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 71: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							Is a person of enlightenment.
						-
					-

							He who is aware of what he does not know, shall not be at fault.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 71: Verse 2: Line 2

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 3: Line 1
					-
						-
							Because there is no detest against the people,
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 3: Line 2
					-
						-
							Therefore the people do not detest against the authority.
						-
				-

				-

						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 4: Line 1

						-
							The saint realizes his true nature and hence does not distinguish
							himself.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 4: Line 2
					-
						-
							He has a sense of self-respect and thus does not exalt himself.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 4: Line 3
					-
						-
							Therefore, he rejects those that are self-distinguished and
							self-exalted.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 72: Verse 4: Line 4
					-
						-
							And abides by these that are self-awareness and self-respect.

							He who is brave in being daring, acts recklessly and shall be killed.
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 73: Verse 1: Line 2
					-
						-
							He who is brave but acts cautiously and kindly shall live.

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 73: Verse 1: Line 3
					-
						-
							Of these two, one is beneficial while the other is harmful.

							Yet, when Heaven's anger smites a man,

					-
						-
							Who the cause shall truly scan?
						-
					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 73: Verse 1: Line 6

							So he takes great caution in practicing It.

							When people do not fear death,

							There is no use trying to threaten them with death.

							If people value their lives, and those who break the law were being

					-
						-
							Those who substitute the nature executioner to kill,

					-
						Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 74: Verse 2: Line 3
					-
						-
							Is like replacing the master carpenter to chop the wood.

							One who substitutes the master carpenter to chop the wood,

							People are difficult to be ruled,

							Because the ruler governs with personal desire and establishes too many

							Therefore the people are difficult to be ruled.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 75: Verse 3

					-

							People take death lightly,

					-
						-
							Because the ruler pursues after luxurious life and depletes the people.
						-

							Therefore the people take death lightly.

							When the stretch is too high, it needs to be pressed down.

							The Tao of Nature is to reduce the excessive and to replenish the

					-
						-
							The Tao of man, however is otherwise.

							It takes from the needy to serve those who already have a surplus.

				-
					Part 2 - Te Ching: Chapter 77: Verse 4
				-

							Thus, a saint acts without holding on to the achievements.

							He accomplishes but does not claim for credit.

							Even those that can conquer the strong and hard,
