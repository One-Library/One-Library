								Vast is the 'great and originating power' indicated by Ch'ien! All
								things owe to it their beginning: it contains all the meanings

								The sages grandly understand the connection between the end and the
								beginning, and how the indications of the six lines in the hexagram
								are accomplished, each in its season. Accordingly they mount the
								carriage drawn by those six dragons at the proper times, and drive
								through the sky.

								The method of Ch'ien is to change and transform, so that everything
								obtains its correct nature as appointed by the mind of Heaven; and
								thereafter the conditions of great harmony are preserved in union.
								The result is 'what is advantageous, and correct and firm.'

									The dragon lies hid in the deep; it is not the time for active
									doing; this appears from the strong and undivided line being in

									The dragon exceeds the proper limits; there will be occasion

								-
									The same undivided line is used in all the places of this
									hexagram, but the attribute of heaven should not always take
									the foremost place. (This is the seventh or hidden line of the
									Qian hexagram. Only two hexagrams, namely Qian and Kun, have
									this hidden line.)

								If he take the initiative, he goes astray: he misses, that is, his
								proper course. If he follow, he is docile, and gets into his
								regular course. In the southwest he will get friends: he will be
								walking with those of his own class. In the northeast he will lose
								friends: but in the end there will be ground for congratulation.

									Good fortune belonging to the most illustrious instance of
									seeking union and attachment appears in the correct and central
									position of the fifth line, undivided. The King's neglecting
									the animals confronting him and then fleeing, and only taking
									those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in
									his allowing the escape of those in front of him. That the
									people of his towns do not warn one another to prevent such
									escape, shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them
									pursue the due course.

								The want of good understanding between the different classes of men
								in P'i and its indication as unfavorable to the firm and correct
								course of the superior man; with the intimation that the great are
								gone and the little come: all this springs from the fact that in it
								heaven and earth are not in communication with each other, and all
								things in consequence do not have free course; and that the high
								and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with
								one another, and there are no well-regulated states under the sky.

								Hêng denotes long continuance. The strong trigram is above, and the

								When one's movements and restings all take place at the proper time
								for them, his way of proceeding is brilliant and intelligent.

								Resting in one's resting-point is resting in one's proper place.
								The upper and lower lines of the hexagram exactly correspond to
								each other, but are without any interaction; hence it is said that
								the subject of the hexagram has no consciousness of self; that when
								he walks in his courtyard, he does not see any of the persons in
								it; and that there will be no error.

								Sung intimates how, though there is sincerity in one's contention,

									Good fortune belonging to the most illustrious instance of
									seeking union and attachment appears in the correct and central
									position of the fifth line, undivided. The King's neglecting
									the animals confronting him and then fleeing, and only taking
									those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in
									his allowing the escape of those in front of him. That the
									people of his towns do not warn one another to prevent such
									escape, shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them
									pursue the due course.

								The want of good understanding between the different classes of men
								in P'i and its indication as unfavorable to the firm and correct
								course of the superior man; with the intimation that the great are
								gone and the little come: all this springs from the fact that in it
								heaven and earth are not in communication with each other, and all
								things in consequence do not have free course; and that the high
								and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with
								one another, and there are no well-regulated states under the sky.

								Hêng denotes long continuance. The strong trigram is above, and the
								weak one below; they are the symbols of thunder and wind, which are
								in mutual communication; they have the qualities of docility and
								motive force; their strong and weak lines all respond, each to the
								other: these things are all found in Hêng.

								When it is said that Hêng indicates successful progress and no
								error in what it denotes; but the advantage will come from being
								firm and correct, this indicates that there must be long
								continuance in its way of operation. The way of heaven and earth is
								to be long continued in their operation without stopping.

								When one's movements and restings all take place at the proper time
								for them, his way of proceeding is brilliant and intelligent.

								Resting in one's resting-point is resting in one's proper place.
								The upper and lower lines of the hexagram exactly correspond to
								each other, but are without any interaction; hence it is said that
								the subject of the hexagram has no consciousness of self; that when
								he walks in his courtyard, he does not see any of the persons in
								it; and that there will be no error.

						-
							Section 2 - Notes: Item 2 - Rules: Part 1: Casting: Method 1 - Ancient
							Yarrow Stalk: Line 5
						-
							-
								Remove 4 stalks at a time from the LEFT hand, and put them on the
								table, in individual piles of 4 stalks each. This process is
								stopped when there are 4 or less stalks left. Put these remaining
								stalks held on the LEFT hand between the ring finger and the middle
								finger of the LEFT hand.
							-
						-
							Section 2 - Notes: Item 2 - Rules: Part 1: Casting: Method 1 - Ancient

							-
								Set these counted stalks separately, and gather the uncounted
								stalks into a new pile. Repeat the steps above, to obtain a second
								total of 4 or 8. This time the possible combinations are 1+4+3, or
								1+3+4, or 1+1+2, or 1+2+1. Likewise, these stalks are separated.
							-
						-
							Section 2 - Notes: Item 2 - Rules: Part 1: Casting: Method 1 - Ancient
							Yarrow Stalk: Line 9

								Repeat the procedure one last time, to get a third set of 4 or 8

							-
						-
							Section 2 - Notes: Item 2 - Rules: Part 1: Casting: Method 1 - Ancient
							Yarrow Stalk: Line 10
						-
							-
								The counted stalks are in groups of 4/5 or 8/9. For each group of 8
								or 9, count 2. For each group of 4 or 5, count 3. This count should
								match the final number of removed piles of four, and determines the
								hexagram line.

					-
						-
							To use the coin oracle, you must have three similar coins. Heads are
							yang and have value 3. Tails are yin and have value 2. Throw the coins
							six times and add up the numbers each time. For each throw record the
							number and kind of line it refers to (6 = transforming yin; 7 = stable
							yang; 8 = stable yin; 9 = transforming yang). Form your hexagram from
							the bottom up, then use the key to the hexagrams... to determine its
							number and name.
