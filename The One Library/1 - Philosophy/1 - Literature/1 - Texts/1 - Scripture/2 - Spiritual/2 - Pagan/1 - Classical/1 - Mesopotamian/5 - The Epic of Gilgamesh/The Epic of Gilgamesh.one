				Tablet 0 - Prologue: Verse 1
			-
				-
					He had seen everything, had experienced all emotions, from exaltation to
					despair, had been granted a vision into the great mystery, the secret places,
					the primeval days before the Flood. He had journeyed to the edge of the world
					and made his way back, exhausted but whole. He had carved his trials on stone
					tablets, had restored the holy Eanna Temple and the massive wall of Uruk, which
					no city on earth can equal. See how its ramparts gleam like copper in the sun.
					Climb the stone staircase, more ancient than the mind can imagine, approach the
					Eanna Temple, sacred to Ishtar, a temple that no king has equaled in size or
					beauty, walk on the wall of Uruk, follow its course around the city, inspect
					its mighty foundations, examine its brickwork, how masterfully it is built,
					observe the land it encloses: the palm trees, the gardens, the orchards, the
					glorious palaces and temples, the shops and marketplaces, the houses, the
					public squares. Find the cornerstone and under it the copper box that is marked
					with his name. Unlock it. Open the lid. Take out the tablet of lapis lazuli.
					Read how Gilgamesh suffered all and accomplished all.

				Tablet 1: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Surpassing all kings, powerful and tall beyond all others, violent, splendid, a
					wild bull of a man, unvanquished leader, hero in the front lines, beloved by
					his soldiers—fortress they called him, protector of the people, raging flood
					that destroys all defenses—two-thirds divine and one-third human, son of King
					Lugalbanda, who became a god, and of the goddess Ninsun, he opened the mountain
					passes, dug wells on the slopes, crossed the vast ocean, sailed to the rising
					sun, journeyed to the edge of the world, in search of eternal life, and once he
					found Utnapishtim—the man who survived the Great Flood and was made immortal—he
					brought back the ancient, forgotten rites, restoring the temples that the Flood
					had destroyed, renewing the statutes and sacraments for the welfare of the
					people and the sacred land. Who is like Gilgamesh? What other king has inspired
					such awe? Who else can say, "I alone rule, supreme among mankind"? The goddess
					Aruru, mother of creation, had designed his body, had made him the strongest of
					men—huge, handsome, radiant, perfect.
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 2
			-
				-
					The city is his possession, he struts through it, arrogant, his head raised
					high, trampling its citizens like a wild bull. He is king, he does whatever he
					wants, takes the son from his father and crushes him, takes the girl from her
					mother and uses her, the warrior's daughter, the young man's bride, he uses
					her, no one dares to oppose him. But the people of Uruk cried out to heaven,
					and their lamentation was heard, the gods are not unfeeling, their hearts were
					touched, they went to Anu, father of them all, protector of the realm of sacred
					Uruk, and spoke to him on the people's behalf: "Heavenly Father,
					Gilgamesh—noble as he is, splendid as he is—has exceeded all bounds. The people
					suffer from his tyranny, the people cry out that he takes the son from his
					father and crushes him, takes the girl from her mother and uses her, the
					warrior's daughter, the young man's bride, he uses her, no one dares to oppose
					him. Is this how you want your king to rule? Should a shepherd savage his own
					flock? Father, do something, quickly, before the people overwhelm heaven with
					their heartrending cries."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Anu heard them, he nodded his head, then to the goddess, mother of creation, he
					called out: "Aruru, you are the one who created humans. Now go and create a
					double for Gilgamesh, his second self, a man who equals his strength and
					courage, a man who equals his stormy heart. Create a new hero, let them balance
					each other perfectly, so that Uruk has peace."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 4
			-
				-
					When Aruru heard this, she closed her eyes, and what Anu had commanded she
					formed in her mind. She moistened her hands, she pinched off some clay, she
					threw it into the wilderness, kneaded it, shaped it to her idea, and fashioned
					a man, a warrior, a hero: Enkidu the brave, as powerful and fierce as the war
					god Ninurta. Hair covered his body, hair grew thick on his head and hung down
					to his waist, like a woman's hair. He roamed all over the wilderness, naked,
					far from the cities of men, ate grass with gazelles, and when he was thirsty he
					drank clear water from the waterholes, kneeling beside the antelope and deer.
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 5
			-
				-
					One day, a human—a trapper—saw him drinking with the animals at a waterhole.
					The trapper's heart pounded, his face went white, his legs shook, he was numb
					with terror. The same thing happened a second, a third day. Fear gripped his
					belly, he looked drained and haggard like someone who has been on a long, hard
					journey.
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 6
			-
				-
					He went to his father. "Father, I have seen a savage man at the waterhole. He
					must be the strongest man in the world, with muscles like rock. I have seen him
					outrun the swiftest animals. He lives among them, eats grass with gazelles, and
					when he is thirsty he drinks clear water from the waterholes. I haven't
					approached him—I am too afraid. He fills in the pits I have dug, he tears out
					the traps I have set, he frees the animals, and I can catch nothing. My
					livelihood is gone."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"Son, in Uruk there lives a man named Gilgamesh. He is king of that city and
					the strongest man in the world, they say, with muscles like rock. Go now to
					Uruk, go to Gilgamesh, tell him what happened, then follow his advice. He will
					know what to do."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 8
			-
				-
					He made the journey, he stood before Gilgamesh in the center of Uruk, he told
					him about the savage man. The king said, "Go to the temple of Ishtar, ask them
					there for a woman named Shamhat, one of the priestesses who give their bodies
					to any man, in honor of the goddess. Take her into the wilderness. When the
					animals are drinking at the waterhole, tell her to strip off her robe and lie
					there naked, ready, with her legs apart. The wild man will approach. Let her
					use her love-arts. Nature will take its course, and then the animals who knew
					him in the wilderness will be bewildered, and will leave him forever."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 9
			-
				-
					The trapper found Shamhat, Ishtar's priestess, and they went off into the
					wilderness. For three days they walked. On the third day they reached the
					waterhole. There they waited. For two days they sat as the animals came to
					drink clear water. Early in the morning of the third day, Enkidu came and knelt
					down to drink clear water with the antelope and deer. They looked in amazement.
					The man was huge and beautiful. Deep in Shamhat's loins desire stirred. Her
					breath quickened as she stared at this primordial being. "Look," the trapper
					said, "there he is. Now use your love-arts. Strip off your robe and lie here
					naked, with your legs apart. Stir up his lust when he approaches, touch him,
					excite him, take his breath with your kisses, show him what a woman is. The
					animals who knew him in the wilderness will be bewildered, and will leave him
					forever."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 10
			-
				-
					She stripped off her robe and lay there naked, with her legs apart, touching
					herself. Enkidu saw her and warily approached. He sniffed the air. He gazed at
					her body. He drew close, Shamhat touched him on the thigh, touched his penis,
					and put him inside her. She used her love-arts, she took his breath with her
					kisses, held nothing back, and showed him what a woman is. For seven days he
					stayed erect and made love with her, until he had had enough. At last he stood
					up and walked toward the waterhole to rejoin his animals. But the gazelles saw
					him and scattered, the antelope and deer bounded away. He tried to catch up,
					but his body was exhausted, his life-force was spent, his knees trembled, he
					could no longer run like an animal, as he had before. He turned back to
					Shamhat, and as he walked he knew that his mind had somehow grown larger, he
					knew things now that an animal can't know.
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Enkidu sat down at Shamhat's feet. He looked at her, and he understood all the
					words she was speaking to him. "Now, Enkidu, you know what it is to be with a
					woman, to unite with her. You are beau tiful, you are like a god. Why should
					you roam the wilderness and live like an animal? Let me take you to
					great-walled Uruk, to the temple of Ishtar, to the palace of Gilgamesh the
					mighty king, who in his arrogance oppresses the people, trampling upon them
					like a wild bull."
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 12
			-
				-
					She finished, and Enkidu nodded his head. Deep in his heart he felt something
					stir, a longing he had never known before, the longing for a true friend.
					Enkidu said, "I will go, Shamhat. Take me with you to great-walled Uruk, to the
					temple of Ishtar, to the palace of Gilgamesh the mighty king. I will challenge
					him. I will shout to his face: 'I am the mightiest! I am the man who can make
					the world tremble! I am supreme!'"
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 13
			-
				-
					"Come," said Shamhat, "let us go to Uruk, I will lead you to Gilgamesh the
					mighty king. You will see the great city with its massive wall, you will see
					the young men dressed in their splendor, in the finest linen and embroidered
					wool, brilliantly colored, with fringed shawls and wide belts. Every day is a
					festival in Uruk, with people singing and dancing in the streets, musicians
					playing their lyres and drums, the lovely priestesses standing before the
					temple of Ishtar, chatting and laughing, flushed with sexual joy, and ready to
					serve men's pleasure, in honor of the goddess, so that even old men are aroused
					from their beds. You who are still so ignorant of life, I will show you
					Gilgamesh the mighty king, the hero destined for both joy and grief. You will
					stand before him and gaze with wonder, you will see how handsome, how virile he
					is, how his body pulses with erotic power. He is even taller and stronger than
					you—so full of life-force that he needs no sleep. Enkidu, put aside your
					aggression. Shamash, the sun god, loves him, and his mind has been made large
					by Anu, father of the gods, made large by Enlil, the god of earth, and by Ea,
					the god of water and wisdom. Even before you came down from the hills, you had
					come to Gilgamesh in a dream." And she told Enkidu what she had heard. "He went
					to his mother, the goddess Ninsun, and asked her to interpret the dream. 'I saw
					a bright star, it shot across the morning sky, it fell at my feet and lay
					before me like a huge boulder. I tried to lift it, but it was too heavy. I
					tried to move it, but it would not budge. A crowd of people gathered around me,
					the people of Uruk pressed in to see it, like a little baby they kissed its
					feet. This boulder, this star that had fallen to earth—I took it in my arms, I
					embraced and caressed it the way a man caresses his wife. Then I took it and
					laid it before you. You told me that it was my double, my second self.' The
					mother of Gilgamesh, Lady Ninsun, the wise, the all-knowing, said to her son,
					'Dearest child, this bright star from heaven, this huge boulder that you could
					not lift—it stands for a dear friend, a mighty hero. You will take him in your
					arms, embrace and caress him the way a man caresses his wife. He will be your
					double, your second self, a man who is loyal, who will stand at your side
					through the greatest dangers. Soon you will meet him, the companion of your
					heart. Your dream has said so.' Gilgamesh said, 'May the dream come true. May
					the true friend appear, the true companion, who through every danger will stand
					at my side.'"
				-
			-
				Tablet 1: Verse 14
			-
				-
					When Shamhat had finished speaking, Enkidu turned to her, and again they made
					love.

				Tablet 2: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Then Shamhat gave Enkidu one of her robes and he put it on. Taking his hand,
					she led him like a child to some shepherds' huts.
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Marveling, the shepherds crowded around him. "What an enormous man!" they
					whispered. "How much like Gilgamesh he is—tall and strong, with muscles like
					rock." They led him to their table, they put bread and beer in front of him.
					Enkidu sat and stared. He had never seen human food, he didn't know what to do.
					Then Shamhat said, "Go ahead, Enkidu. This is food, we humans eat and drink
					this." Warily he tasted the bread. Then he ate a piece, he ate a whole loaf,
					then ate another, he ate until he was full, drank seven pitchers of the beer,
					his heart grew light, his face glowed, and he sang out with joy. He had his
					hair cut, he washed, he rubbed sweet oil into his skin, and became fully human.
					Shining, he looked handsome as a bridegroom. When the shepherds lay down,
					Enkidu went out with sword and spear. He chased off lions and wolves, all night
					he guarded the flocks, he stayed awake and guarded them while the shepherds
					slept.
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 3
			-
				-
					One day, while he was making love, he looked up and saw a young man pass by.
					"Shamhat," he said, "bring that man here. I want to talk to him. Where is he
					going?" She called out, then went to the man and said, "Where are you going in
					such a rush?" The man said to Enkidu, "I am on my way to a wedding banquet. I
					have piled the table with exquisite food for the ceremony. The priest will
					bless the young couple, the guests will rejoice, the bridegroom will step
					aside, and the virgin will wait in the marriage bed for Gilgamesh, king of
					great-walled Uruk. It is he who mates first with the lawful wife. After he is
					done, the bridegroom follows. This is the order that the gods have decreed.
					From the moment the king's birth-cord was cut, every girl's hymen has belonged
					to him."
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 4
			-
				-
					As he listened, Enkidu's face went pale with anger. "I will go to Uruk now, to
					the palace of Gilgamesh the mighty king. I will challenge him. I will shout to
					his face: 'I am the mightiest! I am the man who can make the world tremble! I
					am supreme!'"
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Together they went to great-walled Uruk, Enkidu in front, Shamhat behind him.
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 6
			-
				-
					When he walked into the main street of Uruk, the people gathered around him,
					marveling, the crowds kept pressing closer to see him, like a little baby they
					kissed his feet. "What an enormous man!" they whispered. "How much like
					Gilgamesh—not quite so tall but strongerboned. In the wilderness he grew up
					eating grass with gazelles, he was nursed on the milk of antelope and deer.
					Gilgamesh truly has met his match. This wild man can rival the mightiest of
					kings."
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 7
			-
				-
					The wedding ritual had taken place, the musicians were playing their drums and
					lyres, the guests were eating, singing and laughing, the bride was ready for
					Gilgamesh as though for a god, she was waiting in her bed to open to him, in
					honor of Ishtar, to forget her husband and open to the king.
				-
			-
				Tablet 2: Verse 8
			-
				-
					When Gilgamesh reached the marriage house, Enkidu was there. He stood like a
					boulder, blocking the door. Gilgamesh, raging, stepped up and seized him, huge
					arms gripped huge arms, foreheads crashed like wild bulls, the two men
					staggered, they pitched against houses, the doorposts trembled, the outer walls
					shook, they careened through the streets, they grappled each other, limbs
					intertwined, each huge body straining to break free from the other's embrace.
					Finally, Gilgamesh threw the wild man and with his right knee pinned him to the
					ground. His anger left him. He turned away. The contest was over. Enkidu said,
					"Gilgamesh, you are unique among humans. Your mother, the goddess Ninsun, made
					you stronger and braver than any mortal, and rightly has Enlil granted you the
					kingship, since you are destined to rule over men." They embraced and kissed.
					They held hands like brothers. They walked side by side. They became true
					friends.

			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Time passed quickly. Gilgamesh said, "Now we must travel to the Cedar Forest,
					where the fierce monster Humbaba lives. We must kill him and drive out evil
					from the world."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Enkidu sighed. His eyes filled with tears. Gilgamesh said, "Why are you
					sighing? Why, dear friend, do your eyes fill with tears?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Enkidu answered, "Dear friend, a scream sticks in my throat, my arms are limp.
					I knew that country when I roamed the hills with the antelope and deer. The
					forest is endless, it spreads far and wide for a thousand miles. What man would
					dare to penetrate its depths?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said, "Listen, dear friend, even if the forest goes on forever, I
					have to enter it, climb its slopes, cut down a cedar that is tall enough to
					make a whirlwind as it falls to earth."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Enkidu said, "But how can any man dare to enter the Cedar Forest? It is sacred
					to Enlil. Hasn't he declared its entrance forbidden, hasn't he put Humbaba
					there to terrify men? We must not go on this journey, we must not fight this
					creature. His breath spews fire, his voice booms like thunder, his jaws are
					death. He can hear all sounds in the forest, even the faintest rustling among
					the leaves, he will hear us a hundred miles away. Who among men or gods could
					defeat him? Humbaba is the forest's guardian, Enlil put him there to terrify
					men. Whoever enters will be struck down by fear."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh answered, "Why, dear friend, do you speak like a coward? What you
					just said is unworthy of you, it grieves my heart.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 7
			-
				-
					We are not gods, we cannot ascend to heaven. No, we are mortal men.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Only the gods live forever. Our days are few in number, and whatever we achieve
					is a puff of wind. Why be afraid then, since sooner or later death must come?
					Where is the courage you have always had? If I die in the forest on this great
					adventure, won't you be ashamed when people say, 'Gilgamesh met a hero's death
					battling the monster Humbaba. And where was Enkidu? He was safe at home!' You
					were raised in the mountains, with your own hands you have killed marauding
					lions and wolves, you are brave, your heart has been tested in combat. But
					whether you come along or not, I will cut down the tree, I will kill Humbaba, I
					will make a lasting name for myself, I will stamp my fame on men's minds
					forever."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh bolted the seven gates of great-walled Uruk, and the people gathered,
					crowds of them poured out into the streets. Gilgamesh sat on his throne. The
					crowds pressed in to hear him. Gilgamesh spoke: "Hear me, elders of
					great-walled Uruk. I must travel now to the Cedar Forest, where the fierce
					monster Humbaba lives. I will conquer him in the Cedar Forest, I will cut down
					the tree, I will kill Humbaba, the whole world will know how mighty I am. I
					will make a lasting name for myself, I will stamp my fame on men's minds
					forever."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Then Gilgamesh turned to the young men and spoke: "Hear me, young men of
					great-walled Uruk, warriors and comrades who have fought at my side. I will
					journey to meet the monster Humbaba, I will walk a road that no man has
					traveled, I will face a combat that no man has known. Give me your blessing
					before I leave, so that I may come back from the Cedar Forest victorious, and
					see your faces again. Once again may I celebrate the New Year with you, in the
					streets of great-walled Uruk, to the lyre's sound and the beat of the drums."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Enkidu stood up. There were tears in his eyes. "Elders of Uruk, persuade the
					king not to go to the Cedar Forest, not to fight the fierce monster Humbaba,
					whose roar booms forth like a thunderclap, whose breath spews fire, whose jaws
					are death, who can hear all sounds in the forest, even the faintest rustling
					among the leaves. Who among men or gods could defeat him? Humbaba is the
					forest's guardian, Enlil put him there to terrify men."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 12
			-
				-
					The elders bowed to the king and said, "You are young, Sire, your heart beats
					high and runs away with you. Why do you wish to embark on this folly? We have
					heard of Humbaba, he is dangerous, he is horrible to look at, his breath spews
					fire, his jaws are death. How can any man, even you, dare to enter the Cedar
					Forest? Who among men or gods could defeat him? Humbaba is the forest's
					guardian, Enlil put him there to terrify men."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 13
			-
				-
					After he had listened to the elders' words, Gilgamesh laughed. He got up and
					said, "Dear friend, tell me, has your courage returned? Are you ready to leave?
					Or are you still afraid of dying a hero's death? Enkidu, let us go to the forge
					and order the smiths to make us weapons that only the mightiest heroes could
					use."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 14
			-
				-
					Enkidu listened gravely. He stood silent there for a long time. At last he
					nodded. Gilgamesh took his hand.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 15
			-
				-
					The smiths listened to their instructions. They cast huge weapons that ordinary
					men could never carry: axes that weighed two hundred pounds each, knives with
					cross guards and heavy mountings of solid gold. Each man carried weapons and
					armor weighing more than six hundred pounds.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said, "Before we leave, let us pay a visit to my mother's temple, let
					us go and speak to the lady Ninsun, the wise, the allknowing. Let us bow before
					her, let us ask for her blessing and her advice."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Hand in hand, the two friends walked to Ninsun's temple. Gilgamesh bowed to his
					mother, the goddess Ninsun, and said, "I must travel now to the Cedar Forest, I
					must journey to meet the fierce monster Humbaba, I must walk a road that no man
					has traveled, I must face a combat that no man has known. Dear mother, great
					goddess, help me in this, give me your blessing before I leave, so that I may
					come back from the Cedar Forest victorious, and see your face again."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 18
			-
				-
					Ninsun listened to his words with sorrow. With sorrow she entered her inner
					room, she bathed in water of tamarisk and soapwort, she put on her finest robe,
					a wide belt, a jeweled necklace, then put on her crown. She climbed the stairs
					and went up to the roof, she lit sweet incense in honor of Shamash, she lifted
					her arms in prayer and said, "Lord of heaven, you have granted my son beauty
					and strength and couragewhy have you burdened him with a restless heart? Now
					you have stirred him up to attack the monster Humbaba, to make a long journey
					from which he may not return. Since he has resolved to go, protect him until he
					arrives at the Cedar Forest, until he kills the monster Humbaba and drives from
					the world the evil that you hate. Protect him each day as you cross the sky,
					and at twilight may Aya your bride entrust him to the valiant stars, the
					watchmen of the night. O Lord Shamash, glorious sun, delight of the gods,
					illuminator of the world, who rise and the light is born, it fills the heavens,
					the whole earth takes shape, the mountains form, the valleys grow bright,
					darkness vanishes, evil retreats, all creatures wake up and open their eyes,
					they see you, they are filled with joy-protect my son. On his dangerous journey
					let the days be long, let the nights be short, let his stride be vigorous and
					his legs sturdy. When he and his dear friend Enkidu arrive, stir up strong
					winds against Humbaba, the south wind, the north wind, the east and the west,
					storm wind, gale wind, hurricane, tornado, to pin Humbaba, to paralyze his
					steps and make it easy for my son kill him. Then your swift mules will carry
					you onward to your stopping place and bed for the night, the gods will bring
					luscious food to delight you, Aya will dry your face with the fringe of her
					pure white robe. Hear me, O Lord, protect my son, in your great mercy lead him
					to the Forest, then bring him home."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 19
			-
				-
					After she had prayed, the goddess Ninsun, the wise, the all-knowing, came down
					from the roof and summoned Enkidu. "Dear child," she said, "you were not born
					from my womb, but now I adopt you as my son." She hung a jeweled amulet around
					Enkidu's neck. "As a priestess takes in an abandoned child, I have taken in
					Enkidu as my own son. May he be a brother for Gilgamesh. May he guide him to
					the Forest, and bring him home."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Enkidu listened. Tears filled his eyes. He and Gilgamesh clasped hands like
					brothers.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 21
			-
				-
					They took their weapons: the massive axes, the massive knives, the quivers, the
					bows. The elders made way. The young men cheered.
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 22
			-
				-
					The elders stood up and addressed the king: "Come back safely to great-walled
					Uruk. Do not rely on your strength alone, but be watchful, be wary, make each
					blow count. Remember what the ancient proverb says: 'If you walk in front, you
					protect your comrade; if you know the route, you safeguard your friend.' Let
					Enkidu go ahead as you walk, he knows the way to the Cedar Forest, he is tested
					in battle, he is brave and strong, he will guard you at every stage of the
					journey, through every danger he will stand at your side. May Shamash grant you
					your heart's desire, may the path to the Cedar Forest be straight, may the
					nights be safe, with no dangers lurking, may your father Lugalbanda protect
					you, may you conquer Humbaba, may the battle be quick, may you joyfully wash
					your feet in his river. Dig a well when you stop for the night, fill your
					waterskins with fresh water, each day make an offering to Shamash, and remember
					Lugalbanda your father, who journeyed to far-off mountains himself."
				-
			-
				Tablet 3: Verse 23
			-
				-
					The elders turned to Enkidu and said, "We leave the king in your care. Protect
					him, guide him through all the treacherous passes, show him where to find food
					and where to dig for fresh water, lead him to the forest and fight at his side.
					May Shamash help you, may the gods grant your heart's desire and bring you back
					safe to great-walled Uruk."

					At four hundred miles they stopped to eat, at a thousand miles they pitched
					their camp. They had traveled for just three days and nights, a six weeks'
					journey for ordinary men. When the sun was setting, they dug a well, they
					filled their waterskins with fresh water, Gilgamesh climbed to the mountaintop,
					he poured out flour as an offering and said, "Mountain, bring me a favorable
					dream." Enkidu did the ritual for dreams, praying for a sign. A gust of wind
					passed. He built a shelter for the night, placed Gilgamesh on the floor and
					spread a magic circle of flour around him, then sprawled like a net across the
					doorway. Gilgamesh sat there, with his chin on his knees, and sleep overcame
					him, as it does all men.

					from heaven, the voice of the god called to Gilgamesh: "Hurry, attack, attack

					They stood at the edge of the Cedar Forest, marveling at the great height of

					as he came and went. From far off they saw the Cedar Mountain, sacred to
					Ishtar, where the gods dwell, the slopes of it steep, and rich in cedars with
					their sharp fragrance and pleasant shade. Gripping their axes, their knives
					unsheathed, they entered the Forest and made their way through the tangle of

					Suddenly Enkidu was seized by terror, his face turned pale like a severed head.

				Tablet 5: Verse 4

					Enkidu said, "You have never met him, so you don't know the horror that lurks

					stick out like tusks, his face, blood-smeared, is a lion's face, he charges
					ahead like a raging torrent, his forehead ablaze. Who can withstand him? I am
					terrified. I cannot go on."
				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 5

					Gilgamesh said, "Courage, dear brother, this is no time to give in to fear. We

					marauding lions and wolves, you are brave, your heart has been tested in
					combat. Though your arms feel weak now and your legs tremble, you are a
					warrior, you know what to do. Shout out your battle-cry, let your voice pound
					like a kettle drum. Let your heart inspire you to be joyous in battle, to
					forget about death. If we help each other and fight side by side, we will make

					They came within sight of the monster's den. He was waiting inside it. Their

					never go home. Prepare to die." Dread surged through Gilgamesh, terror flooded
					his muscles, his heart froze, his mouth went dry, his legs shook, his feet were
					rooted to the ground.
				-

					They advanced to the monster's den. Humbaba charged out roaring at them and
					said, "I know you, Gilgamesh. Don't be a fool. Go away. Leave the Cedar Forest.
					Have madmen told you to confront me here? I will tear you limb from limb, I
					will crush you and leave you bloody and mangled on the ground. And you, Enkidu,
					you son of a fish or a turtle, you gutless, fatherless spawn who never suckled
					on mother's milk, I saw you in the pastures when you were young, I saw you
					graze with the wandering herds but I didn't kill you, you were too scrawny, you
					wouldn't have made a decent meal. And now you dare to lead Gilgamesh here, you
					both stand before me looking like a pair of frightened girls. I will slit your
					throats, I will cut off your heads, I will feed your stinking guts to the

					Gilgamesh backed away. He said, "How dreadful Humbaba's face has become! It is

				Tablet 5: Verse 11

				-
					Two intimate friends cannot be defeated. Be courageous. Remember how strong you

				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh felt his courage return. They charged at Humbaba like two wild bulls.
					The monster let out a deafening cry, his roar boomed forth like a blast of
					thunder, he stamped and the ground burst open, his steps split the mountains of
					Lebanon, the clouds turned black, a sulfurous fog descended on them and made
					their eyes ache. Then Shamash threw strong winds at Humbaba, the south wind,
					the north wind, the east and the west, storm wind, gale wind, hurricane,
					tornado, to pin him down and paralyze his steps. He could not move forward,
					could not retreat. Gilgamesh saw it, he leaped upon him, he held a knife to
					Humbaba's throat.
				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 14
			-
				-
					Humbaba said, "Gilgamesh, have mercy. Let me live here in the Cedar Forest. If
					you spare my life, I will be your slave, I will give you as many cedars as you
					wish. You are king of Uruk by the grace of Shamash, honor him with a cedar
					temple and a glorious cedar palace for yourself. All this is yours, if only you
					spare me."
				-

					Enkidu said, "Dear friend, don't listen to anything that the monster says. Kill

				Tablet 5: Verse 16
			-

					Humbaba said, "If any mortal, Enkidu, knows the rules of my forest, it is you.
					You know that this is my place and that I am the forest's guardian. Enlil put
					me here to terrify men, and I guard the forest as Enlil ordains. If you kill
					me, you will call down the gods' wrath, and their judgment will be severe. I
					could have killed you at the forest's edge, I could have hung you from a cedar
					and fed your guts to the shrieking vultures and crows. Now it is your turn to
					show me mercy. Speak to him, beg him to spare my life."
				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Enkidu said, "Dear friend, quickly, before another moment goes by, kill
					Humbaba, don't listen to his words, don't hesitate, slaughter him, slit his
					throat, before the great god Enlil can stop us, before the great gods can get
					enraged, Enlil in Nippur, Shamash in Larsa. Establish your fame, so that
					forever men will speak of brave Gilgamesh, who killed Humbaba in the Cedar
					Forest."
				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 18
			-
				-
					Knowing he was doomed, Humbaba cried out, "I curse you both. Because you have
					done this, may Enkidu die, may he die in great pain, may Gilgamesh be
					inconsolable, may his merciless heart be crushed with grief."
				-
			-
				Tablet 5: Verse 19

					Gilgamesh dropped his axe, appalled. Enkidu said, "Courage, dear friend. Close
					your ears to Humbaba's curses. Don't listen to a word. Slaughter him! Now!"
				-

				Tablet 5: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh, hearing his beloved friend, came to himself. He yelled, he lifted
					his massive axe, he swung it, it tore into Humbaba's neck, the blood shot out,
					again the axe bit flesh and bone, the monster staggered, his eyes rolled, and
					at the axe's third stroke he toppled like a cedar and crashed to the ground. At
					his death-roar the mountains of Lebanon shook, the valleys ran with his blood,
					for ten miles the forest resounded. Then the two friends sliced him open,
					pulled out his intestines, cut off his head with its knife-sharp teeth and
					horrible bloodshot staring eyes. A gentle rain fell onto the mountains. A
					gentle rain fell onto the mountains.

				Tablet 5: Verse 21
			-
				-
					They took their axes and penetrated deeper into the forest, they went chopping
					down cedars, the woods chips flew, Gilgamesh chopped down the mighty trees,
					Enkidu hewed the trunks into timbers. Enkidu said, "By your great strength you
					have killed Humbaba, the forest's watchman. What could bring you dishonor now?
					We have chopped down the trees of the Cedar Forest, we have brought to earth
					the highest of the trees, the cedar whose top once pierced the sky. We will
					make it into a gigantic door, a hundred feet high and thirty feet wide, we will
					float it down the Euphrates to Enlil's temple in Nippur. No men shall go
					through it, but only the gods. May Enlil delight in it, may it be a joy to the
					people of Nippur."

					"Come here, Gilgamesh," Ishtar said, "marry me, give me your luscious fruits,

					marble and alabaster, ivory and jade, gorgeous servants with blue-green eyes, a
					chariot of lapis lazuli with golden wheels and guide-horns of amber, pulled by
					storm-demons like giant mules. When you enter my temple and its cedar
					fragrance, high priests will bow down and kiss your feet, kings and princes
					will kneel before you, bringing you tribute from east and west. And I will
					bless everything that you own, your goats will bear triplets, your ewes will
					twin, your donkeys will be faster than any mule, your chariot-horses will win
					every race, your oxen will be the envy of the world. These are the least of the
					gifts I will shower upon you. Come here. Be my sweet man."

					Gilgamesh said, "Your price is too high, such riches are far beyond my means.

					burns out?
				-

				Tablet 6: Verse 5

					"Why would I want to be the lover of a broken oven that fails in the cold, a

					the workman's hands, a waterskin that is full of holes and leaks all over its
					bearer, a piece of limestone that crumbles and undermines a solid stone wall, a
					battering ram that knocks down the rampart of an allied city, a shoe that
					mangles its owner's foot?
				-

				Tablet 6: Verse 6
			-
				-
					"Which of your husbands did you love forever? Which could satisfy your endless
					desires? Let me remind you of how they suffered, how each one came to a bitter
					end. Remember what happened to that beautiful boy Tammuz: you loved him when
					you were both young, then you changed, you sent him to the underworld and
					doomed him to be wailed for, year after year. You loved the bright-speckled
					roller bird, then you changed, you attacked him and broke his wings, and he
					sits in the woods crying Ow-ee! Ow-ee! You loved the lion, matchless in
					strength, then you changed, you dug seven pits for him, and when he fell, you
					left him to die. You loved the hot-blooded, war-bold stallion, then you
					changed, you doomed him to whip and spurs, to endlessly gallop, with a bit in
					his mouth, to muddy his own water when he drinks from a pool, and for his
					mother, the goddess Silili, you ordained a weeping that will never end. You
					loved the shepherd, the master of the flocks, who every day would bake bread
					for you and would bring you a fresh-slaughtered, roasted lamb, then you
					changed, you touched him, he became a wolf, and now his own shepherd boys drive
					him away and his own dogs snap at his hairy thighs. You loved the gardener
					Ishullanu, who would bring you baskets of fresh-picked dates, every day, to
					brighten your table, you lusted for him, you drew close and said, 'Sweet
					Ishullanu, let me suck your rod, touch my vagina, caress my jewel,' and he
					frowned and answered, 'Why should I eat this rotten meal of yours? What can you
					offer but the bread of dishonor, the beer of shame, and thin reeds as covers
					when the cold wind blows?' But you kept up your sweet-talk and at last he gave
					in, then you changed, you turned him into a toad and doomed him to live in his
					devastated garden. And why would my fate be any different? If I too became your
					lover, you would treat me as cruelly as you treated them."

				Tablet 6: Verse 7

					Ishtar shrieked, she exploded with fury. Raging, weeping, she went up to
					heaven, to her father, Anu, and Antu, her mother, as tears of anger poured down
					her cheeks. "Father, Gilgamesh slandered me! He hurled the worst insults at me,
					he said horrible, unforgivable things!"

					Ishtar said, "Please, Father, I beg you, give me the Bull of Heaven, just for a

					Gilgamesh and destroy his palace. If you say no, I will smash the gates of the
					underworld, and a million famished ghouls will ascend to devour the living, and
					the living will be outnumbered by the dead."
				-
			-
				Tablet 6: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Anu said to the princess Ishtar, "But if I give you the Bull of Heaven, Uruk
					will have famine for seven long years. Have you provided the people with grain
					for seven years, and the cattle with fodder?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 6: Verse 11

					Ishtar said, "Yes, of course I have gathered grain and fodder, I have stored up

				-

					When Anu heard this, he called for the Bull and handed its nose rope to the
					princess Ishtar. Ishtar led the Bull down to the earth, it entered and
					bellowed, the whole land shook, the streams and marshes dried up, the
					Euphrates' water level dropped by ten feet. When the Bull snorted, the earth
					cracked open and a hundred warriors fell in and died. It snorted again, the
					earth cracked open and two hundred warriors fell in and died. When it snorted a
					third time, the earth cracked open and Enkidu fell in, up to his waist, he
					jumped out and grabbed the Bull's horns, it spat its slobber into his face, it
					lifted its tail and spewed dung all over him. Gilgamesh rushed in and shouted,
					"Dear friend, keep fighting, together we are sure to win." Enkidu circled
					behind the Bull, seized it by the tail and set his foot on its haunch, then
					Gilgamesh skillfully, like a butcher, strode up and thrust his knife between
					its shoulders and the base of its horns.
				-

				Tablet 6: Verse 13

					After they had killed the Bull of Heaven, they ripped out its heart and they

					Ishtar was outraged. She climbed to the top of Uruk's great wall, she writhed

				-
			-
				Tablet 6: Verse 15
			-
				-
					When Enkidu heard these words, he laughed, he reached down, ripped off one of

					Ishtar assembled her priestesses, those who offer themselves to all men in her
					honor. They placed the Bull's gory thigh on the altar, and began a solemn
					lament.

				Tablet 6: Verse 17
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh summoned his master craftsmen. They marveled at the gigantic horns.
					Each horn was made from thirty pounds of lapis lazuli, each was as thick as the
					length of two thumbs, together they held four hundred gallons. He called for
					that much oil to anoint his father's statue, then hung the two massive horns in
					the chapel dedicated to Lugalbanda.

					The two friends washed themselves in the river and returned to the palace, hand

				Tablet 6: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said to his singing girls, "Tell me: Who is the handsomest of men?
					Tell me: Who is the bravest of heroes? Gilgamesh-he is the handsomest of men,
					Enkidu-he is the bravest of heroes. We are the victors who in our fury flung
					the Bull's thigh in Ishtar's face, and now, in the streets, she has no one to
					avenge her."
				-
			-
				Tablet 6: Verse 20
			-
				-
					There was singing and feasting in the palace that night. Later, when the
					warriors were stretched out asleep, Enkidu had a terrifying dream. When he woke
					up, he said to Gilgamesh, "Dear friend, why are the great gods assembled?"

		-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 1
			-
				-
					"Beloved brother," Enkidu said, "last night I had a terrifying dream. I dreamed
					that we had offended the gods, they met in council and Anu said, 'They have
					slaughtered the Bull of Heaven and killed Humbaba, watchman of the Cedar
					Forest. Therefore one of the two must die.' Then Enlil said to him, 'Enkidu,
					not Gilgamesh, is the one who must die.'"
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Enkidu fell sick. He lay on his bed, sick at heart, and his tears flowed like
					streams. He said to Gilgamesh, "Dear friend, dear brother, they are taking me
					from you. I will not return. I will sit with the dead in the underworld, and
					never will I see my dear brother again."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 3
			-
				-
					When Gilgamesh heard his friend's words, he wept, swiftly the tears flowed down
					his cheeks. He said to Enkidu, "Dearest brother, you have been a reasonable
					man, but now you are talking nonsense. How do you know that your dream is not a
					favorable one? Fear has set your lips buzzing like flies."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Enkidu said, "Beloved brother, last night I had a second bad dream. The heavens
					thundered, the earth replied, and I was standing on a shadowy plain. A creature
					appeared with a lion's head, his face was ghastly, he had a lion's paws, an
					eagle's talons and wings. He flew at me, he seized me by the hair, I tried to
					struggle, but with one blow he capsized me like a raft, he leaped upon me, like
					a bull he trampled my bones. 'Gilgamesh, save me, save me!' I cried. But you
					didn't save me. You were afraid and you didn't come. The creature touched me
					and suddenly feathers covered my arms, he bound them behind me and forced me
					down to the underworld, the house of darkness, the home of the dead, where all
					who enter never return to the sweet earth again. Those who dwell there squat in
					the darkness, dirt is their food, their drink is clay, they are dressed in
					feathered garments like birds, they never see light, and on door and bolt the
					dust lies thick. When I entered that house, I looked, and around me were piles
					of crowns, I saw proud kings who had ruled the land, who had set out roast meat
					before the gods and offered cool water and cakes for the dead. I saw high
					priests and acolytes squatting, exorcists and prophets, the ecstatic and the
					dull, I saw Etana, the primeval king, Sumuqan, the wild animals' god, and
					Ereshkigal, the somber queen of the underworld. Belet-seri, her scribe, was
					kneeling before her, reading from the tablet on which each mortal's death is
					inscribed. When the queen saw me, she glared and said, 'Who has brought this
					new resident here?'"
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said, "Though it sounds bad, this dream may be a good omen. The gods
					send dreams just to the healthy, never to the weak, so it is a healthy man who
					has dreamed this. Now I will pray to the great gods for help, I will pray to
					Shamash and to your god, to Anu, father of the gods, to Enlil the counselor,
					and to Ea the wise, I will beg them to show you mercy, then I will have a gold
					statue made in your image. Don't worry, dear friend, you will soon get better,
					this votive image will restore you to health."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Enkidu said, "There is no gold statue that can cure this illness, beloved
					friend. What Enlil has decided cannot be changed. My fate is settled. There is
					nothing you can do."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 7
			-
				-
					At the first glow of dawn, Enkidu cried out to Shamash, he raised his head, and
					the tears poured down his cheeks. "I turn to you, Lord, since suddenly fate has
					turned against me. As for that wretched trapper who found me when I was free in
					the wilderness-because he destroyed my life, destroy his livelihood, may he go
					home empty, may no animals ever enter his traps, or if they do, may they vanish
					like mist, and may he starve for bringing me here."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 8
			-
				-
					After he had cursed him to his heart's content, he then cursed Shamhat, the
					priestess of Ishtar. "Shamhat, I assign you an eternal fate, I curse you with
					the ultimate curse, may it seize you instantly, as it leaves my mouth. Never
					may you have a home and family, never caress a child of your own, may your man
					prefer younger, prettier girls, may he beat you as a housewife beats a rug, may
					you never acquire bright alabaster or shining silver, the delight of men, may
					your roof keep leaking and no carpenter fix it, may wild dogs camp in your
					bedroom, may owls nest in your attic, may drunkards vomit all over you, may a
					tavern wall be your place of business, may you be dressed in torn robes and
					filthy underwear, may angry wives sue you, may thorns and briars make your feet
					bloody, may young men jeer and the rabble mock you as you walk the streets.
					Shamhat, may all this be your reward for seducing me in the wilderness when I
					was strong and innocent and free."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Bright Shamash, the protector, heard his prayer. Then from heaven the voice of
					the god called out: "Enkidu, why are you cursing the priestess Shamhat? Wasn't
					it she who gave you fine bread fit for a god and fine beer fit for a king, who
					clothed you in a glorious robe and gave you splendid Gilgamesh as your intimate
					friend? He will lay you down on a bed of honor, he will put you on a royal
					bier, on his left he will place your statue in the seat of repose, the princes
					of the earth will kiss its feet, the people of Uruk will mourn you, and when
					you are gone, he will roam the wilderness with matted hair, in a lion skin."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 10
			-
				-
					When Enkidu heard this, his raging heart grew calm. He thought of Shamhat and
					said, "Shamhat, I assign you a different fate, my mouth that cursed you will
					bless you now. May you be adored by nobles and princes, two miles away from you
					may your lover tremble with excitement, one mile away may he bite his lip in
					anticipation, may the warrior long to be naked beside you, may Ishtar give you
					generous lovers whose treasure chests brim with jewels and gold, may the mother
					of seven be abandoned for your sake."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Then Enkidu said to Gilgamesh, "You who have walked beside me, steadfast
					through so many dangers, remember me, never forget what I have endured."
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 12
			-
				-
					The day that Enkidu had his dreams, his strength began failing. For twelve long
					days he was deathly sick, he lay in his bed in agony, unable to rest, and every
					day he grew worse. At last he sat up and called out to Gilgamesh: "Have you
					abandoned me now, dear friend? You told me that you would come to help me when
					I was afraid. But I cannot see you, you have not come to fight off this danger.
					Yet weren't we to remain forever inseparable, you and I?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 7: Verse 13
			-
				-
					When he heard the death rattle, Gilgamesh moaned like a dove. His face grew
					dark. "Beloved, wait, don't leave me. Dearest of men, don't die, don't let them
					take you from me."
				-
		-
			Tablet 8
		-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 1
			-
				-
					All through the long night, Gilgamesh wept for his dead friend. At the first
					glow of dawn, he cried out, "Enkidu, dearest brother, you came to Uruk from the
					wilderness, your mother was a gazelle, your father a wild ass, you were raised
					on the milk of antelope and deer, and the wandering herds taught you where the
					best pastures were. May the paths that led you to the Cedar Forest mourn you
					constantly, day and night, may the elders of great-walled Uruk mourn you, who
					gave us their blessing when we departed, may the hills mourn you and the
					mountains we climbed, may the pastures mourn you as their own son, may the
					forest we slashed in our fury mourn you, may the bear mourn you, the hyena, the
					panther, the leopard, deer, jackal, lion, wild bull, gazelle, may the rivers
					Ulaya and Euphrates mourn you, whose sacred waters we offered to the gods, may
					the young men of great-walled Uruk mourn you, who cheered when we slaughtered
					the Bull of Heaven, may the farmer mourn you, who praised you to the skies in
					his harvest song, may the shepherd mourn you, who brought you milk, may the
					brewer mourn you, who made you fine beer, may Ishtar's priestess mourn you, who
					massaged you with sweet-smelling oil, may the wedding guests mourn you like
					their own brother, may the temple priests mourn you, loosening their hair.
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 2
			-
				-
					"Hear me, elders, hear me, young men, my beloved friend is dead, he is dead, my
					beloved brother is dead, I will mourn as long as I breathe, I will sob for him
					like a woman who has lost her only child. O Enkidu, you were the axe at my side
					in which my arm trusted, the knife in my sheath, the shield I carried, my
					glorious robe, the wide belt around my loins, and now a harsh fate has torn you
					from me, forever. Beloved friend, swift stallion, wild deer, leopard ranging in
					the wilderness—Enkidu, my friend, swift stallion, wild deer, leopard ranging in
					the wilderness—together we crossed the mountains, together we slaughtered the
					Bull of Heaven, we killed Humbaba, who guarded the Cedar Forest—O Enkidu, what
					is this sleep that has seized you, that has darkened your face and stopped your
					breath?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But Enkidu did not answer. Gilgamesh touched his heart, but it did not beat.
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Then he veiled Enkidu's face like a bride's. Like an eagle Gilgamesh circled
					around him, he paced in front of him, back and forth, like a lioness whose cubs
					are trapped in a pit, he tore out clumps of his hair, tore off his magnificent
					robes as though they were cursed.
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 5
			-
				-
					At the first glow of dawn, Gilgamesh sent out a proclamation: "Blacksmiths,
					goldsmiths, workers in silver, metal, and gems-create a statue of Enkidu, my
					friend, make it more splendid than any statue that has ever been made. Cover
					his beard with lapis lazuli, his chest with gold. Let obsidian and all other
					beautiful stones-a thousand jewels of every color-be piled along with the
					silver and gold and sent on a barge, down the Euphrates to great-walled Uruk,
					for Enkidu's statue. I will lay him down on a bed of honor, I will put him on a
					royal bier, on my left I will place his statue in the seat of repose, the
					princes of the earth will kiss its feet, the people of Uruk will mourn him, and
					when he is gone, I will roam the wilderness with matted hair, in a lion skin."
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 6
			-
				-
					After he sent out the proclamation, he went to the treasury, unlocked the door
					and surveyed his riches, then he brought out priceless, jewelstudded weapons
					and tools, with inlaid handles of ivory and gold, and he heaped them up for
					Enkidu, his friend, as an offering to the gods of the underworld. He gathered
					fattened oxen and sheep, he butchered them, and he piled them high for Enkidu,
					his beloved friend. He closed his eyes, in his mind he formed an image of the
					infernal river, then he opened the palace gate, brought out an offering table
					of precious yew wood, filled a carnelian bowl with honey, filled a lapis lazuli
					bowl with butter, and when the offerings were ready he spread out each one in
					front of Shamash.
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 7
			-
				-
					To the great queen Ishtar his offering was a polished javelin of pure cedar.
					"Let Ishtar accept this, let her welcome my friend and walk at his side in the
					underworld, so that Enkidu may not be sick at heart." To Sˆın, the god of the
					moon, he offered a knife with a curved obsidian blade. "Let Sˆın accept this,
					let him welcome my friend and walk at his side in the underworld, so that
					Enkidu may not be sick at heart." To Ereshkigal, the dark queen of the dead, he
					offered a lapis lazuli flask. "Let the queen accept this, let her welcome my
					friend and walk at his side in the underworld, so that Enkidu may not be sick
					at heart." To Tammuz, the shepherd beloved by Ishtar, his offering was a
					carnelian flute; to Namtar, vizier of the dark gods, a lapis lazuli chair and
					scepter; to Hushbishag, handmaid of the dark gods, a golden necklace; to
					Qassa-tabat, the infernal sweeper, a silver bracelet; to the housekeeper,
					Ninshuluhha, a mirror of alabaster, on the back of which was a picture of the
					Cedar Forest, inlaid with rubies and lapis lazuli; to the butcher, Bibbu, a
					double-edged knife with a haft of lapis lazuli bearing a picture of the holy
					Euphrates. When all the offerings were set out, he prayed, "Let the gods accept
					these, let them welcome my friend and walk at his side in the underworld, so
					that Enkidu may not be sick at heart."
				-
			-
				Tablet 8: Verse 8

					After the funeral, Gilgamesh went out from Uruk, into the wilderness with
					matted hair, in a lion skin.

			Tablet 9

				Tablet 9: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh wept over Enkidu his friend, bitterly he wept through the wilderness.
					"Must I die too? Must I be as lifeless as Enkidu? How can I bear this sorrow
					that gnaws at my belly, this fear of death that restlessly drives me onward? If
					only I could find the one man whom the gods made immortal, I would ask him how
					to overcome death."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 2
			-
				-
					So Gilgamesh roamed, his heart full of anguish, wandering, always eastward, in
					search of Utnapishtim, whom the gods made immortal.
				-

				Tablet 9: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Finally he arrived at the two high mountains called the Twin Peaks. Their
					summits touch the vault of heaven, their bases reach down to the underworld,
					they keep watch over the sun's departure and its return. Two scorpion people
					were posted at the entrance, guarding the tunnel into which the sun plunges
					when it sets and moves through the earth to emerge above the horizon at dawn.
					The sight of these two inspired such terror that it could kill an ordinary man.
					Their auras shimmered over the mountains. When Gilgamesh saw them, he was
					pierced with dread, but he steadied himself and headed toward them.
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 4

					The scorpion man called out to his wife, "This one who approaches-he must be a

					The scorpion woman called back to him, "He is two-thirds divine and one-third
					human."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 6
			-
				-
					The scorpion man said, "What is your name? How have you dared to come here? Why
					have you traveled so far, over seas and mountains difficult to cross, through
					wastelands and deserts no mortal has ever entered? Tell me the goal of your
					journey. I want to know."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 7
			-
				-
					"Gilgamesh is my name," he answered, "I am the king of great-walled Uruk and
					have come here to find my ancestor Utnapishtim, who joined the assembly of the
					gods, and was granted eternal life. He is my last hope. I want to ask him how
					he managed to overcome death."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 8
			-
				-
					The scorpion man said, "No one is able to cross the Twin Peaks, nor has anyone
					ever entered the tunnel into which the sun plunges when it sets and moves
					through the earth. Inside the tunnel there is total darkness: deep is the
					darkness, with no light at all."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 9
			-
				-
					The scorpion woman said, "This brave man, driven by despair, his body
					frost-chilled, exhausted, and burnt by the desert sun-show him the way to
					Utnapishtim."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 10
			-
				-
					The scorpion man said, "Ever downward through the deep darkness the tunnel
					leads. All will be pitch black before and behind you, all will be pitch black
					to either side. You must run through the tunnel faster than the wind. You have
					just twelve hours. If you don't emerge from the tunnel before the sun sets and
					enters, you will find no refuge from its deadly fire. Penetrate into the
					mountains' depths, may the Twin Peaks lead you safely to your goal, may they
					safely take you to the edge of the world. The gate to the tunnel lies here
					before you. Go now in peace, and return in peace."
				-
			-
				Tablet 9: Verse 11
			-
				-
					As the sun was rising, Gilgamesh entered. He began to run. For one hour he ran,
					deep was the darkness, with no light at all before and behind him and to either
					side. For a second and a third hour Gilgamesh ran, deep was the darkness, with
					no light at all before and behind him and to either side. For a fourth and a
					fifth hour Gilgamesh ran, deep was the darkness, with no light at all before
					and behind him and to either side. For a sixth and a seventh hour Gilgamesh
					ran, deep was the darkness, with no light at all before and behind him and to
					either side. At the eighth hour Gilgamesh cried out with fear, deep was the
					darkness, with no light at all before and behind him and to either side. At the
					ninth hour he felt a breeze on his face, deep was the darkness, with no light
					at all before and behind him and to either side. For a tenth and eleventh hour
					Gilgamesh ran, deep was the darkness, with no light at all before and behind
					him and to either side. At the twelfth hour he emerged from the tunnel into the
					light. The sun was hurtling toward the entrance. He had barely escaped.

					Before him the garden of the gods appeared, with gem-trees of all colors,
					dazzling to see. There were trees that grew rubies, trees with lapis lazuli
					flowers, trees that dangled gigantic coral clusters like dates. Everywhere,
					sparkling on all the branches, were enormous jewels: emeralds, sapphires,
					hematite, diamonds, carnelians, pearls. Gilgamesh looked up and marveled at it

					At the edge of the ocean, the tavern keeper Shiduri was sitting. Her face was
					veiled, her golden pot-stand and brewing vat stood at her side. As Gilgamesh
					came toward her, worn out, his heart full of anguish, she thought, "This
					desperate man must be a murderer. Why else is he heading straight toward me?"
					She rushed into her tavern, locked the door, then climbed to the roof.
					Gilgamesh heard the noise, he looked up and saw her standing there, staring at
					him. "Why did you lock yourself in?" he shouted. "I want to enter now. If you
					don't let me, I will smash your locks and break down your door."
				-

					who has been on a long, hard journey?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 5

				-
					Gilgamesh said, "Shouldn't my cheeks be hollow, shouldn't my face be ravaged,
					frost-chilled, and burnt by the desert sun? Shouldn't my heart be filled with
					grief? Shouldn't I be worn out and ready to collapse? My friend, my brother,
					whom I loved so dearly, who accompanied me through every danger—Enkidu, my
					brother, whom I loved so dearly, who accompanied me through every danger—the
					fate of mankind has overwhelmed him. For six days I would not let him be
					buried, thinking, 'If my grief is violent enough, perhaps he will come back to
					life again.' For six days and seven nights I mourned him, until a maggot fell
					out of his nose. Then I was frightened, I was terrified by death, and I set out
					to roam the wilderness. I cannot bear what happened to my friend—I cannot bear
					what happened to Enkidu—so I roam the wilderness in my grief. How can my mind
					have any rest? My beloved friend has turned into clay—my beloved Enkidu has
					turned into clay. And won't I too lie down in the dirt like him, and never
					arise again?"
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Shiduri said, "Gilgamesh, where are you roaming? You will never find the
					eternal life that you seek. When the gods created mankind, they also created
					death, and they held back eternal life for themselves alone. Humans are born,
					they live, then they die, this is the order that the gods have decreed. But
					until the end comes, enjoy your life, spend it in happiness, not despair. Savor
					your food, make each of your days a delight, bathe and anoint yourself, wear
					bright clothes that are sparkling clean, let music and dancing fill your house,
					love the child who holds you by the hand, and give your wife pleasure in your
					embrace. That is the best way for a man to live."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh cried out, "What are you saying, tavern keeper? My heart is sick for
					my friend who died. What can your words mean when my heart is sick for Enkidu
					who died? Show me the road to Utnapishtim. I will cross the vast ocean if I
					can. If not, I will roam the wilderness in my grief."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Shiduri said, "Never has there been a path across the vast ocean, nor has there
					ever been any human who was able to cross it. Only brave Shamash as he climbs
					the sky can cross the vast ocean-who else can do it? The crossing is harsh, the
					danger is great, and midway lie the Waters of Death, whose touch kills
					instantly. Even if you manage to sail that distance, what will you do when you
					reach the Waters of Death? The one man who can help you is Urshanabi,
					Utnapishtim's boatman. He is trimming pine branches down in the forest, and he
					has the Stone Men with him. Go to him. Ask. If he says yes, you can cross the
					vast ocean. If he says no, you will have to turn back."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 9
			-
				-
					At these words, Gilgamesh gripped his axe, drew his knife, and crept down
					toward them. When he was close, he fell upon them like an arrow. His battle-cry
					rang through the forest. Urshanabi saw the bright knife, saw the axe flash, and
					he stood there, dazed. Fear gripped the Stone Men who crewed the boat.
					Gilgamesh smashed them to pieces, then threw them into the sea. They sank in
					the water.
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh came back and stood before him. Urshanabi stared, then he said, "Who

					Utnapishtim, the Distant One."
				-

				Tablet 10: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"Gilgamesh is my name," he answered, "I am the king of great-walled Uruk. I
					have traveled here across the high mountains, I have traveled here on the
					hidden road through the underworld, where the sun comes forth. Show me the way
					to Utnapishtim."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 12
			-
				-
					Urshanabi said, "Your own hands have prevented the crossing, since in your fury
					you have smashed the Stone Men, who crewed my boat and could not be injured by
					the Waters of Death. But don't despair. There is one more way we can cross the
					vast ocean. Take your axe, cut down three hundred punting poles, each a hundred
					feet long, strip them, make grips, and bring them to me. I will wait for you
					here."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 13
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh went deep into the forest, he cut down three hundred punting poles,
					each a hundred feet long, he stripped them, made grips, and brought them to
					Urshanabi the boatman. They boarded the boat and sailed away.
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 14
			-
				-
					They sailed, without stopping, for three days and nights, a six weeks' journey
					for ordinary men, until they reached the Waters of Death. Urshanabi said, "Now
					be careful, take up the first pole, push us forward, and do not touch the
					Waters of Death. When you come to the end of the first pole, drop it, take up a
					second and a third one, until you come to the end of the three-hundredth pole
					and the Waters of Death are well behind us."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 15

				-
					When all three hundred poles had been used, Gilgamesh took Urshan abi's robe.
					He held it as a sail, with both arms extended, and the little boat moved on
					toward the shore.
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 16
			-
				-
					Alone on the shore stood Utnapishtim, wondering as he watched them approach.

					Utnapishtim said, "Why are your cheeks so hollow? Why is your face so ravaged,

					heart? Why are you worn out and ready to collapse, like someone who has been on
					a long, hard journey?"
				-

				Tablet 10: Verse 19
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said, "Shouldn't my cheeks be hollow, shouldn't my face be ravaged,
					frost-chilled, and burnt by the desert sun? Shouldn't my heart be filled with
					grief? Shouldn't I be worn out and ready to collapse? My friend, my brother,
					whom I loved so dearly, who accompanied me through every danger—Enkidu, my
					brother, whom I loved so dearly, who accompanied me through every danger—the
					fate of mankind has overwhelmed him. For six days I would not let him be
					buried, thinking, 'If my grief is violent enough, perhaps he will come back to
					life again.' For six days and seven nights I mourned him, until a maggot fell
					out of his nose. Then I was frightened, I was terrified by death, and I set out
					to roam the wilderness. I cannot bear what happened to my friend—I cannot bear
					what happened to Enkidu—so I roam the wilderness in my grief. How can my mind
					have any rest? My beloved friend has turned into clay—my beloved Enkidu has
					turned into clay. And won't I too lie down in the dirt like him, and never
					arise again? That is why I must find Utnapishtim, whom men call 'The Distant
					One.' I must ask him how he managed to overcome death. I have wandered the
					world, climbed the most treacherous mountains, crossed deserts, sailed the vast
					ocean, and sweet sleep has rarely softened my face. I have worn myself out
					through ceaseless striving, I have filled my muscles with pain and anguish. I
					have killed bear, lion, hyena, leopard, tiger, deer, antelope, ibex, I have
					eaten their meat and have wrapped their rough skins around me. And what in the
					end have I achieved? When I reached Shiduri the tavern keeper, I was filthy,
					exhausted, heartsick. Now let the gate of sorrow be closed behind me, and let
					it be sealed shut with tar and pitch."
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 20
			-
				-
					Utnapishtim said, "Gilgamesh, why prolong your grief? Have you ever paused to
					compare your own blessed lot with a fool's? You were made from the flesh of
					both gods and humans, the gods have lavished you with their gifts as though
					they were your fathers and mothers, from your birth they assigned you a throne
					and told you, 'Rule over men!' To the fool they gave beer dregs instead of
					butter, stale crusts instead of bread that is fit for gods, rags instead of
					magnificent garments, instead of a wide fringed belt an old rope, and a
					frantic, senseless, dissatisfied mind. Can't you see how fortunate you are? You
					have worn yourself out through ceaseless striving, you have filled your muscles
					with pain and anguish. And what have you achieved but to bring yourself one day
					nearer to the end of your days? At night the moon travels across the sky, the
					gods of heaven stay awake and watch us, unsleeping, undying. This is the way
					the world is established, from ancient times.
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 21
			-
				-
					"Yes: the gods took Enkidu's life. But man's life is short, at any moment it
					can be snapped, like a reed in a canebrake. The handsome young man, the lovely
					young woman—in their prime, death comes and drags them away. Though no one has
					seen death's face or heard death's voice, suddenly, savagely, death destroys
					us, all of us, old or young. And yet we build houses, make contracts, brothers
					divide their inheritance, conflicts occur—as though this human life lasted
					forever. The river rises, flows over its banks and carries us all away, like
					mayflies floating downstream: they stare at the sun, then all at once there is
					nothing.
				-
			-
				Tablet 10: Verse 22
			-
				-
					"The sleeper and the dead, how alike they are! Yet the sleeper wakes up and
					opens his eyes, while no one returns from death. And who can know when the last
					of his days will come? When the gods assemble, they decide your fate, they
					establish both life and death for you, but the time of death they do not
					reveal."

					Gilgamesh said to Utnapishtim, "I imagined that you would look like a god. But
					you look like me, you are not any different. I intended to fight you, yet now
					that I stand before you, now that I see who you are, I can't fight, something
					is holding me back. Tell me, how is it that you, a mortal, overcame death and
					joined the assembly of the gods and were granted eternal life?"

				Tablet 11: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Utnapishtim said, "I will tell you a mystery, a secret of the gods. You know
					Shuruppak, that ancient city on the Euphrates. I lived there once. I was its
					king once, a long time ago, when the great gods decided to send the Flood. Five
					gods decided, and they took an oath to keep the plan secret: Anu their father,
					the counselor Enlil, Ninurta the gods' chamberlain, and Ennugi the sheriff. Ea
					also, the cleverest of the gods, had taken the oath, but I heard him whisper
					the secret to the reed fence around my house. 'Reed fence, reed fence, listen
					to my words. King of Shuruppak, quickly, quickly tear down your house and build
					a great ship, leave your possessions, save your life. The ship must be square,
					so that its length equals its width. Build a roof over it, just as the Great
					Deep is covered by the earth. Then gather and take aboard the ship examples of
					every living creature.'

				Tablet 11: Verse 4
			-

					"Ea said, 'Tell them that Enlil hates you, that you can no longer live in their
					city or walk on the earth, which belongs to Enlil, that it is your fate to go

					abundance upon them. They will all have all that they want, and more.'

					"I laid out the structure, I drafted plans. At the first glow of dawn, everyone
					gathered—carpenters brought their saws and axes, reed workers brought their
					flattening-stones, rope makers brought their ropes, and children carried the
					tar. The poor helped also, however they couldsome carried timber, some hammered
					nails, some cut wood. By the end of the fifth day the hull had been built: the
					decks were an acre large, the sides two hundred feet high. I built six decks,
					so that the ship's height was divided in seven. I divided each deck into nine
					compartments, drove water plugs into all the holes, brought aboard spars and
					other equipment, had three thousand gallons of tar poured into the furnace, and
					three thousand gallons of pitch poured out. The bucket carriers brought three
					thousand gallons of oil—a thousand were used for the caulking, two thousand
					were left, which the boatman stored. Each day I slaughtered bulls for my
					workmen, I slaughtered sheep, I gave them barrels of beer and ale and wine, and
					they drank it like river water. When all our work on the ship was finished, we
					feasted as though it were New Year's Day. At sunrise I handed out oil for the
					ritual, by sunset the ship was ready. The launching was difficult. We rolled
					her on logs down to the river and eased her in until two-thirds was under the
					water. I loaded onto her everything precious that I owned: all my silver and
					gold, all my family, all my kinfolk, all kinds of animals, wild and tame,
					craftsmen and artisans of every kind.

					"Then Shamash announced that the time had come. 'Enter the ship now. Seal the

					"At the first glow of dawn, an immense black cloud rose on the horizon and

					Hanish, twin gods of destruction, went first, tearing through mountains and
					valleys. Nergal, the god of pestilence, ripped out the dams of the Great Deep,
					Ninurta opened the floodgates of heaven, the infernal gods blazed and set the
					whole land on fire. A deadly silence spread through the sky and what had been
					bright now turned to darkness. The land was shattered like a clay pot. All day,
					ceaselessly, the storm winds blew, the rain fell, then the Flood burst forth,
					overwhelming the people like war. No one could see through the rain, it fell
					harder and harder, so thick that you couldn't see your own hand before your
					eyes. Even the gods were afraid. The water rose higher and higher until the
					gods fled to Anu's palace in the highest heaven. But Anu had shut the gates.
					The gods cowered by the palace wall, like dogs.

					Flood upon them? I have given birth to the human race, only to see them fill

					"For six days and seven nights, the storm demolished the earth. On the seventh
					day, the downpour stopped. The ocean grew calm. No land could be seen, just
					water on all sides, as flat as a roof. There was no life at all. The human race
					had turned into clay. I opened a hatch and the blessed sunlight streamed upon
					me, I fell to my knees and wept. When I got up and looked around, a coastline
					appeared, a half mile away. On Mount Nimush the ship ran aground, the mountain
					held it and would not release it. For six days and seven nights, the mountain
					would not release it. On the seventh day, I brought out a dove and set it free.
					The dove flew off, then flew back to the ship, because there was no place to
					land. I waited, then I brought out a swallow and set it free. The swallow flew
					off, then flew back to the ship, because there was no place to land. I waited,
					then I brought out a raven and set it free. The raven flew off, and because the
					water had receded, it found a branch, it sat there, it ate, it flew off and
					didn't return.

					It is right to punish the sinner for his sins, to punish the criminal for his
					crime, but be merciful, do not allow all men to die because of the sins of
					some. Instead of a flood, you should have sent lions to decimate the human
					race, or wolves, or a famine, or a deadly plague. As for my taking the solemn
					oath, I didn't reveal the secret of the gods, I only whispered it to a fence
					and Utnapishtim happened to hear. Now you must decide what his fate will be.'

					mortal man. But from now on, he and his wife shall be gods like us, they shall

					She baked the loaves and put them beside him, she made a mark for each day he

					Utnapishtim said, "Look down, friend, count these loaves that my wife baked and

					Utnapishtim said to the boatman, "This is the last time, Urshanabi, that you

					Bring him to the tub and wash out his hair, take off his animal skin and let

					When he heard this, Gilgamesh turned the boat around, and he brought it back to
					the shore. Utnapishtim said, "Gilgamesh, you came a very long way, you endured
					many hardships to get here. Now I will give you something for your journey
					home, a mystery, a secret of the gods. There is a small spiny bush that grows
					in the waters of the Great Deep, it has sharp spikes that will prick your

					Gilgamesh dug a pit on the shore that led down into the Great Deep. He tied two

					stones, his body shot up to the surface, and the waves cast him back, gasping,
					onto the shore.
				-

				Tablet 11: Verse 29
			-
				-
					Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi, "Come here, look at this marvelous plant, the
					antidote to the fear of death. With it we return to the youth we once had. I
					will take it to Uruk, I will test its power by seeing what happens when an old
					man eats it. If that succeeds, I will eat some myself and become a carefree
					young man again."
				-

					At four hundred miles they stopped to eat, at a thousand miles they pitched

					the plant away. As it disappeared, it cast off its skin.
				-

				Tablet 11: Verse 31
			-
				-
					When Gilgamesh saw what the snake had done, he sat down and wept. He said to
					the boatman, "What shall I do now? All my hardships have been for nothing. O
					Urshanabi, was it for this that my hands have labored, was it for this that I
					gave my heart's blood? I have gained no benefit for myself but have lost the
					marvelous plant to a reptile. I plucked it from the depths, and how could I
					ever manage to find that place again? And our little boat—we left it on the
					shore."

					When at last they arrived, Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi, "This is the wall of
					Uruk, which no city on earth can equal. See how its ramparts gleam like copper
					in the sun. Climb the stone staircase, more ancient than the mind can imagine,
					approach the Eanna Temple, sacred to Ishtar, a temple that no king has equaled
					in size or beauty, walk on the wall of Uruk, follow its course around the city,
					inspect its mighty foundations, examine its brickwork, how masterfully it is
					built, observe the land it encloses: the palm trees, the gardens, the orchards,
					the glorious palaces and temples, the shops and marketplaces, the houses, the
					public squares."
