				Scene of the weighing of the Heart of the Dead. Ani and his wife enter the Hall of
				Double Law or Truth, wherein the heart, emblematical of the conscience, is to be
				weighed in the balance against the feather, emblematical of law. Above, twelve
				gods, each holding a sceptre are seated upon thrones before a table of offerings of
				fruit, flowers, etc. Their names are: Harmachis, "the great god within his boat";
				Tmu; Shu; Tefnut, "lady of heaven"; Seb; Nut, "lady of Heaven" Isis; Nephthys;
				Horus, "the great god"; Hathor, "lady of Amenta"; and Sa. Upon the beam of the
				scales sits the dog-headed ape which was associated with Thoth, the scribe of the
				gods. The god Anubis, jackal-headed, tests the tongue of the balance, the
				suspending bracket of which is in the form of the feather The inscription above the
				head of Anubis reads:--"He who is in the tomb saith, pray thee, O weigher of
				righteousness, to guide (?) the balance that it may be stablished.'" On the left of
				the balance, facing Anubis, stands Ani's "Luck" or "Destiny," Shai and above is the
				object called mesxen which has been described as "a cubit with human head," and
				which is supposed to be connected with the place of birth. Behind these stand the
				goddesses Meskhenet and Renenet: Meskhenet presiding over the birth-chamber, and
				Renenet probably superintending the rearing of children. Behind the meskhen is the
				soul of Ani in the form of a human-headed bird standing on a pylon. On the right of
				the balance, behind Anubis, stands Thoth, the scribe of the gods, with his reed-pen
				and palette containing black and red ink, with which to record the result of the
				trial. Behind Thoth stands the female monster Amam , the "Devourer," or Am-mit, the
				eater of the Dead."

				Osiris, the scribe Ani, saith: "My heart my mother, my heart my mother, my heart my
				coming into being! May there be nothing to resist me at [my] judgment; may there be
				no opposition to me from the Tchatcha; may there be no parting of thee from me in
				the presence of him who keepeth the scales! Thou art my ka within my body [which]
				knitteth and strengtheneth my limbs. Mayest thou come forth to the place of
				happiness to which I am advancing. "May the Shenit not cause my name to stink, and
				may no lies be spoken against me in the presence of the god! Good is it for thee to
				hear." . . . . . . . Thoth, the righteous judge of the great company of the gods
				who are in the presence of the god Osiris, saith: "Hear ye this judgment. The heart
				of Osiris hath in very truth been weighed, and his soul hath stood as a witness for
				him; it hath been found true by trial in the Great Balance. There hath not been
				found any wickedness in him; he hath not wasted the offerings in the temples; he
				hath not done harm by his deeds; and he uttered no evil reports while he was upon
				earth." The great company of the gods reply to Thoth dwelling in Khemennu: "That
				which cometh forth from thy mouth hath been ordained. Osiris, the scribe Ani,
				triumphant, is holy and righteous. He hath not sinned, neither hath he done evil
				against us. Let it not be given to the devourer Amemet to prevail over him.
				Meat-offerings and entrance into the presence of the god Osiris shall be granted
				unto him, together with a homestead for ever in Sekhet-hetepu, as unto the
				followers of Horus."

				Ani, found just, is led into the presence of Osiris. On the left the hawk-headed
				god Horus, the son of Isis, wearing the double crown of the North and the South,
				takes Ani by the hand and leads him forward towards "Osiris, the lord of eternity"
				Ausar neb t'etta, who is enthroned on the right within a shrine in the form of a
				funereal chest. The god wears the atef crown with plumes; a menat (see p. 245, note
				2) hangs from the back of his neck; and he holds in his hands the crook, sceptre,
				and flail, emblems of sovereignty and dominion. He is wrapped in bandages
				ornamented with scale work. The side of his throne is painted to resemble the doors
				of the tomb. Behind him stand Nephthys on his right hand and Isis on his left.
				Facing him, and standing on a lotus flower, are the four "children of Horus (or
				Osiris)," or gods of the cardinal points. The first, Mestha, has the head of a man;
				the second, Hapi, the head of an ape; the third, Tuamautef, the head of a jackal;
				and the fourth, Qebhsennuf, the head of a hawk. Suspended near the lotus is an
				object which is usually called a panther's skin, but is more probably a bullock's
				hide. The roof of the shrine is supported on pillars with lotus capitals, and is
				surmounted by a figure of Horus-Sept or Horus-Seker and rows of uræi. In the centre
				Ani kneels before the god upon a reed mat, raising his right hand in adoration, and
				holding in his left hand the kherp sceptre. He wears a whitened wig surmounted by a
				"cone," the signification of which is unknown. Round his neck is a deep collar of
				precious stones. Near him stands a table of offerings of meat, fruit, flowers,
				etc., and in the compartments above are a number of vessels for wine, beer, oil,
				wax, etc., together with bread, cakes, ducks, a wreath, and single flowers.

				Saith Horus, the son of Isis: "I have come unto thee, O Unnefer, and I have brought
				the Osiris Ani unto thee. His heart is [found] righteous coming forth from the
				balance, and it hath not sinned against god or goddess. Thoth hath weighed it
				according to the decree uttered unto him by the company {p. 261} of the gods; and
				it is very true and righteous. Grant him cakes and ale; and let him enter into the
				presence of Osiris; and may he be like unto the followers of Horus for ever."
				Behold, Osiris Ani saith: "O Lord of Amentet (the underworld), I am in thy
				presence. There is no sin in me, I have not lied wittingly, nor have I done aught
				with a false heart. Grant that I may be like unto those favoured ones who are round
				about thee, and that I may be an Osiris, greatly favoured of the beautiful god and
				beloved of the lord of the world, [I] the royal scribe indeed, who loveth him Ani,
				triumphant before the god Osiris."

				The funereal procession to the tomb; running the length of the two plates. In the
				centre of Plate V. the mummy of the dead man is seen lying in a chest or shrine
				mounted on a boat with runners, which is drawn by oxen. In the boat, at the head
				and foot of the mummy, are two small models of Nephthys and Isis. By the side
				kneels Ani's wife Thuthu, lamenting. In front of the boat is the Sem priest burning
				incense in a censer, and pouring out a libation from a vase; he wears his
				characteristic dress, a panther's skin. Eight mourners follow. one of whom has his
				hair whitened. In the rear a sepulchral ark or chest surmounted. by a figure of
				Anubis and ornamented with emblems of "protection" and "stability," is drawn on a
				sledge by four attendants, and is followed by two others. By their side walk other
				attendants carrying Ani's palette, boxes, chair, couch, staff, etc. In Plate VI.
				the procession is continued up to the tomb. In the centre is a group of wailing
				women, followed by attendants carrying on yokes boxes of flowers, vases of
				unguents, etc. In the right centre are a cow with her calf, chairs of painted wood
				with flowers upon them, and an attendant with shaven head, carrying a haunch, newly
				cut, for the funereal feast. The group on the right is performing the last rites.
				Before the door of the tomb stands the mummy of Ani to receive the final honours;
				behind him, embracing him, stands Anubis, the god of the tomb; and at his feet, in
				front, kneels Thuthu to take a last farewell of her husband's body. Before a table
				of offerings stand two priests: the Sem priest, who wears a panther's skin, holding
				in his right hand a libation vase, and in his left a censer; and a priest holding
				in his right hand an instrument with which he is about to touch the mouth and eyes
				of the mummy, and in his left the instrument for "opening the mouth." Behind or
				beside them on the ground, in a row, lie the instruments employed in the ceremony
				of "opening the mouth," etc., the mesxet instrument, the sepulchral box, the boxes
				of purification, the bandlet, the libation vases, the ostrich feather and the
				instruments called Seb-ur, Temanu or Tun-tet, and the Pesh-en-kef. The Kher-heb
				priest stands behind reading the service of the dead from a papyrus.

				-
					his rising in the eastern horizon of heaven. "I am Yesterday; I know

				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 21

					(as others say), Amentet is that which Ra hath given unto me; when any god

			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 27

				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 28
			-
				-
					It is his filth. The things which are are and the things which shall be are his

				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 29
			-
				-
					They are eternity and everlastingness. Eternity is the day, and everlastingness

			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 30

					is the night. "I am the god Amsu in his coming-forth; may his
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 31
			-

					two plumes be set upon my head." Who then is this? Amsu is Horus, the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 32
			-
				-
					avenger of his father, and his coming-forth is his birth. The
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 33

				Item 13 - Text: Line 38

				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 39
			-
				-
					"1 have made an end of my shortcomings, and I have put away my faults." What
					then
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 40
			-
				-
					is this? It is the cutting off of the corruptible in the body of Osiris, the
					scribe Ani,
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 41
			-
				-
					triumphant before all the gods; and all his faults are driven out.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 42
			-
				-
					What then is this? It is the purification [of Osiris] on the day of his birth.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 43
			-
				-
					"I am purified in my exceeding great double nest which is in Suten henen,

			-
				-
					on the day of the offerings of the followers of the great god who is therein."
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 45
			-
				-
					What then is this? "Millions of years" is the name of the one [nest],
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 46
			-
				-
					"Green Lake" is the name of the other; a pool of natron, and a pool of nitre;
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 47
			-
				-
					or (as others say), "The Traverser of Millions of Years" is the name of the
					one, "Great Green Lake"
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 48
			-
				-
					is the name of the other; or (as others say), " The Begetter of Millions of
					Years" is the name of the one, "Green Lake" is
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 49
			-
				-
					the name of the other. Now as concerning the great god who is in it, it is Ra
					himself.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 50
			-
				-
					"I pass over the way, I know the head of the Pool of Maata."
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 51
			-
				-
					What then is this? It is Re-stau; that is to say, it is the underworld on the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 52
			-
				-
					south of Naarut-f, and it is the northern door of the tomb. Now as concerning
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 53
			-
				-
					She-Maaat, it is Abtu; or (as others say), It is the road by which his
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 54
			-
				-
					father Tmu travelleth when he goeth to Sekhet-Aaru,
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 55
			-
				-
					which bringeth forth the food and nourishment of the gods behind the shrine.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 56
			-
				-
					Now the Gate of Sert is the gate of the pillars of Shu,
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 57
			-
				-
					the northern gate of the underworld; or (as others say), It is the two leaves
					of the door through
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 58
			-
				-
					which the god Tmu passeth when he goeth forth in the eastern horizon of heaven.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 59
			-
				-
					"O ye gods who are in the presence (of Osiris), grant me your arms, for I am
					the god
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 60
			-
				-
					who shall come into being among you." What then is this? It is the drops of
					blood
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 61
			-
				-
					which fell from Ra when he went forth
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 62
			-
				-
					to cut himself. They sprang into being as the gods Hu and Sa, who are in the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 63
			-
				-
					following of Ra and who accompany Tmu
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 64
			-
				-
					daily and every day. "I, Osiris, Ani
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 65
			-
				-
					the scribe, triumphant, have filled up for thee the utchat after it was
					darkened
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 66
			-
				-
					on the day of the combat of the Two Fighters." What then
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 67
			-
				-
					is this? It is the day on which Horus fought with
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 68
			-
				-
					Set, who cast filth in the face of Horus, and when Horus destroyed the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 69
			-
				-
					powers of Set. Thoth did this with his own hand.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 70
			-
				-
					"I lift the hair[-cloud] when there are storms in the sky." What then is this?
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 71
			-
				-
					It is the right eye of Ra, which raged against [Set] when
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 72
			-
				-
					he sent it forth. Thoth raiseth up the hair[-cloud], and bringeth the eye
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 73
			-
				-
					alive, and whole, and sound, and without defect to [its] lord; or (as others
					say), It is the eye of Ra when it is sick and when it
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 74
			-
				-
					weepeth for its fellow eye; then Thoth standeth up to cleanse it.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 75
			-
				-
					"I behold Ra who was born yesterday from the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 76
			-
				-
					buttocks of the cow Meh-urt; his strength is my strength, and my strength is
					his strength." What then
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 77
			-
				-
					is this? It is the water of heaven, or (as others say),
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 78
			-
				-
					It is the image of the eye of Ra in the morning at his daily birth.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 79
			-
				-
					Meh-urt is the eye of Ra. Therefore Osiris, the
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 80
			-
				-
					scribe Ani, triumphant, [is] a great one among the gods
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 81
			-
				-
					who are in the train of Horus. The words are] spoken for him that loveth his
					lord.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 82
			-
				-
					What then is this? [i.e., who are these gods?] Mestha, Hapi Tuamautef, and
					Qebhsennuf.
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 83
			-
				-
					"Homage to you, O ye lords of right and truth, and ye holy ones who [stand]
					behind Osiris, who utterly do away with

				-
					Anubis appointed their place on the day [when was said], 'Come therefore
					thither.'" What then
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 89
			-
				-
					is this? These lords of right and truth are Thoth and
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 90
			-
				-
					Astes, lord of Amenta. The holy ones who stand behind Osiris, even Mestha,
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 91
			-
				-
					Hapi, Tuamautef, and Qebhsennuf, are they who are

					sins and crime and who are in the following of the goddess Hetep-se-khus
				-
			-

			-
				-
					are the god Sebek in the waters. The goddess Hetep-se-khus is the eye of
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 95
			-
				-
					Ra, or (as others say), It is the flame which followeth after Osiris to burn up
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 96
			-
				-
					the souls of his foes. As concerning all the faults which are
				-
			-
				Item 13 - Text: Line 97
			-
				-
					in Osiris, the scribe of the holy offerings of all the gods, Ani, triumphant,
					[they are all that he hath done against the lords of eternity] since he came

					the Cat which fought (?) by the Persea tree hard by in Annu, on the night when
					the foes of Neb-er-tcher were destroyed."] What then is this? The male cat is
					Ra himself, and he is called Maau by reason of the speech of the god Sa [who
					said] concerning him: "He is like (maau) unto that which he hath made, and his
					name became Maau"; or (as others say), It is Shu who maketh over the
					possessions of Seb to Osiris. As to the fight (?) by the Persea tree hard by,
					in Annu, it concerneth the children of impotent revolt when justice is wrought
					on them for what they have done. As to [the words] "that night of the battle,"
					they concern the inroad [of the children of impotent revolt] into the eastern
					part of heaven, whereupon there arose a battle in heaven and in all the earth.
					"O thou who art in the egg (i.e., Ra), who shinest from thy disk and risest in
					thy horizon, and dost shine like gold above the sky, like unto whom there is
					none among the gods, who sailest over the pillars of Shu (i.e., the ether), who
					givest blasts of fire from thy mouth, [who makest the two lands bright with thy
					radiance, deliver] the faithful worshippers from the god whose forms are
					hidden, whose eyebrows are like unto the two arms of the balance on the night
					of the reckoning of destruction." Who then is this? It is An-a-f, the god who
					bringeth his arm. As concerning [the words] "that night of the reckoning of
					destruction," it is the night of the burning of the damned, and of the
					overthrow of the wicked at [the sacred] block, and of the slaughter of souls.
					Who then is this? It is Nemu, the headsman of Osiris; or (as others say), It is
					Apep when he riseth up with one head bearing maat (i.e., right and truth) [upon
					it]; or (as others say), It is Horus when he riseth up with two heads, whereof
					the one beareth maat and the other wickedness. He bestoweth wickedness on him
					that worketh wickedness, and maat on him that followeth after righteousness and
					truth; or (as others say), It is the great Horus who dwelleth in [Se] khem; or
					(as others say), It is Thoth; or (as others say), It is Nefer-Tmu, [or] Sept,
					who doth thwart the course of the foes of Neb-er-tcher. "Deliver me from the
					Watchers who bear slaughtering knives, and who have cruel fingers, and who slay
					those who are in the following of Osiris. May they never overcome me, may I
					never fall under their knives." "What then is this? It is Anubis, and it is
					Horus in the form of Khent-en-maa; or (as others say), It is the Divine Rulers
					who thwart the works of their [weapons]; it is the chiefs of the sheniu
					chamber. "May their knives never get the mastery over me, may I never fall
					under their instruments of cruelty, for I know their names, and I know the
					being Matchet Who is among them in the house of Osiris, shooting rays of light
					from [his] eye, but he himself is unseen. He goeth round about heaven robed in
					the flame of his mouth, commanding Hapi, but remaining himself unseen. May I be
					strong upon earth before Ra, may I come happily into haven in the presence of
					Osiris. Let not your offerings be hurtful to me, O ye who preside over your
					altars, for I am among those who follow after Neb-er-tcher according to the
					writings of Khepera. I fly as a hawk, I cackle as a goose; I ever slay, even as
					the serpent goddess Nehebka." What then is this? They who preside at the altars
					are the similitude of the eye of Ra and the similitude of the eye of Horus. "O
					Ra-Tmu, lord of the Great House, prince, life, strength and health of all the
					gods, deliver thou [me] from the god whose face is like unto that of a dog,
					whose brows are as those of a man, and who feedeth upon the dead, who watcheth
					at the Bight of the Fiery Lake, and who devoureth the bodies of the dead and
					swalloweth hearts, and who shooteth forth filth, but he himself remaineth
					unseen." Who then is this? "Devourer for millions of years" is his name, and he
					dwelleth in the Lake of Unt. As concerning the Fiery Lake, it is that which is
					in Anrutf, hard by the Shenit chamber. The unclean man who would walk thereover
					doth fall down among the knives; or (as others say), His name is "Mathes," and
					he is the watcher of the door of Amenta; or (as others say), His name is
					"Heri-sep-f." "Hail, Lord of terror, chief of the lands of the North and South,
					lord of the red glow, who preparest the slaughter-block, and who dost feed upon
					the inward parts!" Who then is this? The guardian of the Bight of Amenta. What
					then is this? It is the heart of Osiris, which is the devourer of all
					slaughtered things. The urerit crown hath been given unto him with swellings of
					the heart as lord of Suten-henen. What then is this? He to whom hath been given
					the urerit crown with swellings of-the heart as lord of Suten-henen is Osiris.
					He was bidden to rule among the gods on the day of the union of earth with
					earth in the presence of Neb-er-tcher. What then is this? He that was bidden to
					rule among the gods is [Horus] the son of Isis, who was appointed to rule in
					the place of his father Osiris. As to the day of the union of earth with earth,
					it is the mingling of earth with earth in the coffin of Osiris, the Soul that
					liveth in Suten-henen, the giver of meat and drink, the destroyer of wrong, and
					the guide of the everlasting paths. Who then is this? It is Ra himself.
					"Deliver thou [me] from the great god who carrieth away souls, and who
