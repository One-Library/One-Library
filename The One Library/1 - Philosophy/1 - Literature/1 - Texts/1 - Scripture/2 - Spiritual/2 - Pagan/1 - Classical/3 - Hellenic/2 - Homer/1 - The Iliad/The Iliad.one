				Book 1: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Of woes unnumber’d, heavenly goddess, sing!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reign
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Latona’s son a dire contagion spread,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And heap’d the camp with mountains of the dead;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The king of men his reverent priest defied,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And for the king’s offence the people died.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His captive daughter from the victor’s chain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Suppliant the venerable father stands;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Apollo’s awful ensigns grace his hands:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The brother-kings, of Atreus’ royal race
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And Troy’s proud walls lie level with the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						May Jove restore you when your toils are o’er
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But, oh! relieve a wretched parent’s pain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And give Chryseis to these arms again;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In daily labours of the loom employ’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or doom’d to deck the bed she once enjoy’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Far from her native soil and weeping sire.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The trembling priest along the shore return’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And in the anguish of a father mourn’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Silent he wander’d by the sounding main;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The god who darts around the world his rays.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona’s line,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa’s shores.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If e’er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus Chryses pray’d.—the favouring power attends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And from Olympus’ lofty tops descends.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And gloomy darkness roll’d about his head.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The fleet in view, he twang’d his deadly bow,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And hissing fly the feather’d fates below.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On mules and dogs the infection first began;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And last, the vengeful arrows fix’d in man.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Inspired by Juno, Thetis’ godlike son
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Convened to council all the Grecian train;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						For much the goddess mourn’d her heroes slain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The assembly seated, rising o’er the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Achilles thus the king of men address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And measure back the seas we cross’d before?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Tis time to save the few remains of war.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Explore the cause of great Apollo’s rage;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The past, the present, and the future knew:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Uprising slow, the venerable sage
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would’st thou know
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						First give thy faith, and plight a prince’s word
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						’Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.”
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To whom Pelides:—“From thy inmost soul
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Speak what thou know’st, and speak without control.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						E’en by that god I swear who rules the day,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Apollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor will the god’s awaken’d fury cease,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The priest may pardon, and the god may spare.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The monarch started from his shining throne;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Black choler fill’d his breast that boil’d with ire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And from his eye-balls flash’d the living fire:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For this are Phoebus’ oracles explored,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For this with falsehood is my honour stain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And heavenly charms prefer to proffer’d gold?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A maid, unmatch’d in manners as in face,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Skill’d in each art, and crown’d with every grace;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra’s charms,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						When first her blooming beauties bless’d my arms.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Our cares are only for the public weal:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Let me be deem’d the hateful cause of all,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And suffer, rather than my people fall.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But since for common good I yield the fair,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						That he alone has fought and bled in vain.”
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						“Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Would’st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 14: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The due reward of many a well-fought field?
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But to resume whate’er thy avarice craves
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whene’er, by Jove’s decree, our conquering powers
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the king: “Shall I my prize resign
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With tame content, and thou possess’d of thine?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Think not to rob me of a soldier’s right.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 6

					-
						First let the just equivalent be paid;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Such as a king might ask; and let it be
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or grant me this, or with a monarch’s claim
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This hand shall seize some other captive dame.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ulysses’ spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The man who suffers, loudly may complain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But this when time requires.—It now remains
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa’s shores,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And some deputed prince the charge attend:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This Creta’s king, or Ajax shall fulfil,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Or wise Ulysses see perform’d our will;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Achilles’ self conduct her o’er the main;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The god propitiate, and the pest assuage.”

			-
				Book 1: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“O tyrant, arm’d with insolence and pride!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Inglorious slave to interest, ever join’d
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What cause have I to war at thy decree?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The distant Trojans never injured me;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To Phthia’s realms no hostile troops they led:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And walls of rocks, secure my native reign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Hither we sail’d, a voluntary throng,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To avenge a private, not a public wrong:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						What else to Troy the assembled nations draws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But thine, ungrateful, and thy brother’s cause?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Is this the pay our blood and toils deserve;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Disgraced and injured by the man we serve?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A prize as small, O tyrant! match’d with thine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						As thy own actions if compared to mine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Though mine the sweat and danger of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Some trivial present to my ships I bear:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Or barren praises pay the wounds of war.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But know, proud monarch, I’m thy slave no more;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 30
				-
					-
						My fleet shall waft me to Thessalia’s shore:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Left by Achilles on the Trojan plain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 17: Verse 32
				-
					-
						What spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To this the king: “Fly, mighty warrior! fly;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Jove himself shall guard a monarch’s right.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of all the kings (the god’s distinguish’d care)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To power superior none such hatred bear:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Strife and debate thy restless soul employ,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And wars and horrors are thy savage joy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If thou hast strength, ’twas Heaven that strength bestow’d;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						For know, vain man! thy valour is from God.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						I heed thee not, but prize at equal rate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Go, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:—but here
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						’Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						My bark shall waft her to her native land;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Even in thy tent I’ll seize the blooming prize,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Thy loved Briseis with the radiant eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Thou stood’st a rival of imperial power;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 18: Verse 26
				-
					-
						That kings are subject to the gods alone.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His heart swell’d high, and labour’d in his breast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool’d:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Force through the Greeks, and pierce their haughty lord;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-

						This whispers soft his vengeance to control,

					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And calm the rising tempest of his soul.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Just as in anguish of suspense he stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						While half unsheathed appear’d the glittering blade,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Minerva swift descended from above,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sent by the sister and the wife of Jove
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(For both the princes claim’d her equal care);
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Behind she stood, and by the golden hair
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Achilles seized; to him alone confess’d;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A sable cloud conceal’d her from the rest.

						He sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 19: Verse 18

					-
						Known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:

			-
				Book 1: Stanza 20
			-

					Book 1: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Descends Minerva, in her guardian care,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A heavenly witness of the wrongs I bear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From Atreus’ son?—Then let those eyes that view

						The daring crime, behold the vengeance too.”

				Book 1: Stanza 21
			-

					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)

				-
					-
						To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:

						Let great Achilles, to the gods resign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 4

						To reason yield the empire o’er his mind.
					-
				-

						For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy injured honour has its fated hour,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When the proud monarch shall thy arms implore,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 21: Verse 14

				Book 1: Stanza 22

						Those who revere the gods the gods will bless.”

						He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid;

						Nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,

						“O monster! mix’d of insolence and fear,

						Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!

						’Tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Scourge of thy people, violent and base!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 23: Verse 12

					-
						Who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,

					Book 1: Stanza 23: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Forced to deplore when impotent to save:

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 23: Verse 29
				-

					-
						Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill’d;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill’d:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Two generations now had pass’d away,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Two ages o’er his native realm he reign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And now the example of the third remain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						All view’d with awe the venerable man;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who thus with mild benevolence began:—

					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy

				-
					-
						To Troy’s proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 3

				-
					-
						Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Lives there a chief to match Pirithous’ fame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dryas the bold, or Ceneus’ deathless name;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With these of old, to toils of battle bred,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In early youth my hardy days I led;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And smit with love of honourable deeds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters’ gore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway’d;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When Nestor spoke, they listen’d and obey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 22
				-
					-
						If in my youth, even these esteem’d me wise;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 25
				-
					-
						That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Him, awful majesty exalts above
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Let both unite with well-consenting mind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 33
				-
					-
						So shall authority with strength be join’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles’ rage;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 26: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But that imperious, that unconquer’d soul,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						No laws can limit, no respect control.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before his pride must his superiors fall;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His word the law, and he the lord of all?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What king can bear a rival in his sway?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Here on the monarch’s speech Achilles broke,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Should I submit to each unjust decree:—
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Command thy vassals, but command not me.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom’d
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And seize secure; no more Achilles draws
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His conquering sword in any woman’s cause.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The gods command me to forgive the past:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But let this first invasion be the last:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Achilles with Patroclus took his way
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Meantime Atrides launch’d with numerous oars
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A well-rigg’d ship for Chrysa’s sacred shores:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The host to expiate next the king prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wash’d by the briny wave, the pious train
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And bulls and goats to Phoebus’ altars paid;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The sable fumes in curling spires arise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And waft their grateful odours to the skies.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The army thus in sacred rites engaged,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Atrides still with deep resentment raged.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Talthybius and Eurybates the good.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Haste to the fierce Achilles’ tent (he cries),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Submit he must; or if they will not part,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The unwilling heralds act their lord’s commands;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pensive they walk along the barren sands:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Arrived, the hero in his tent they find,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At awful distance long they silent stand,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Loth to advance, and speak their hard command;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Decent confusion! This the godlike man
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“With leave and honour enter our abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ye sacred ministers of men and gods!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I know your message; by constraint you came;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Not you, but your imperious lord I blame.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Patroclus, haste, the fair Briseis bring;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Conduct my captive to the haughty king.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Witness to gods above, and men below!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But first, and loudest, to your prince declare
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The raging chief in frantic passion lost,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Blind to himself, and useless to his host,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Unskill’d to judge the future by the past,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In blood and slaughter shall repent at last.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						She, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Pass’d silent, as the heralds held her hand,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And oft look’d back, slow-moving o’er the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But sad, retiring to the sounding shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						O’er the wild margin of the deep he hung,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There bathed in tears of anger and disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thus loud lamented to the stormy main:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O parent goddess! since in early bloom
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy son must fall, by too severe a doom;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sure to so short a race of glory born,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Great Jove in justice should this span adorn:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And ill he pays the promise of a god,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Obscures my glories, and resumes my prize.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Far from the deep recesses of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And like a mist she rose above the tide;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Beheld him mourning on the naked shores,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus the sorrows of his soul explores.

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-

						“Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;

						From Thebe, sacred to Apollo’s name

						(Aetion’s realm), our conquering army came,

						With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,

					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By vote selected, to the general’s bed.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The priest of Phoebus sought by gifts to gain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His beauteous daughter from the victor’s chain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The fleet he reach’d, and, lowly bending down,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Intreating all; but chief implored for grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The brother-kings of Atreus’ royal race:

				-

						The generous Greeks their joint consent declare,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The priest to reverence, and release the fair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not so Atrides: he, with wonted pride,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The sire insulted, and his gifts denied:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The insulted sire (his god’s peculiar care)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To Phoebus pray’d, and Phoebus heard the prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A dreadful plague ensues: the avenging darts
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Incessant fly, and pierce the Grecian hearts.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 26
				-
					-
						To avert the vengeance of the power divine;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm’d;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Incensed he threaten’d, and his threats perform’d:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 30
				-
					-
						With offer’d gifts to make the god relent;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 31
				-
					-
						But now he seized Briseis’ heavenly charms,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And of my valour’s prize defrauds my arms,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 33
				-

						Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;

				-
					-
						The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Then, call’d by thee, the monster Titan came
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 48
				-
					-
						(Whom gods Briareus, men Ægeon name),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Through wondering skies enormous stalk’d along;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 51
				-
					-
						With giant-pride at Jove’s high throne he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And brandish’d round him all his hundred hands:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The affrighted gods confess’d their awful lord,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 54
				-
					-
						They dropp’d the fetters, trembled, and adored.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 55
				-
					-
						This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 58
				-
					-
						To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 59
				-
					-
						To heap the shores with copious death, and bring
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 61
				-

						Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 62

						O’er all his wide dominion of the dead,

					-
						And mourn in blood that e’er he durst disgrace

					Book 1: Stanza 38: Verse 64

					-
						The boldest warrior of the Grecian race.”

				-
					-
						“Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus replies,

				-
					-
						While tears celestial trickle from her eyes)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 3

					-
						Why have I borne thee with a mother’s throes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?
					-
				-

						So short a space the light of heaven to view!

					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So short a space! and fill’d with sorrow too!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						O might a parent’s careful wish prevail,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Far, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 9

						And thou, from camps remote, the danger shun

					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 10

						Which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.

					-
						To great Olympus crown’d with fleecy snow.

					-
						Meantime, secure within thy ships, from far
					-

					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Behold the field, not mingle in the war.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The sire of gods and all the ethereal train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 16
				-
					-
						On the warm limits of the farthest main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The feasts of Æthiopia’s blameless race,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Returning with the twelfth revolving light.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 39: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then will I mount the brazen dome, and move

						The high tribunal of immortal Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In wild resentment for the fair he lost.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						In Chrysa’s port now sage Ulysses rode;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Beneath the deck the destined victims stow’d:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The sails they furl’d, they lash the mast aside,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And dropp’d their anchors, and the pinnace tied.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Chryseis last descending on the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Her, thus returning from the furrow’d main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ulysses led to Phoebus’ sacred fane;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Where at his solemn altar, as the maid
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hail, reverend priest! to Phoebus’ awful dome
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A suppliant I from great Atrides come:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Unransom’d, here receive the spotless fair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And may thy god who scatters darts around,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this, the sire embraced the maid again,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then near the altar of the darting king,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With water purify their hands, and take
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sacred offering of the salted cake;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish’d rays!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If, fired to vengeance at thy priest’s request,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So Chryses pray’d. Apollo heard his prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Between their horns the salted barley threw,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On these, in double cauls involved with art,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The choicest morsels lay from every part.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The priest himself before his altar stands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And burns the offering with his holy hands.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The youth with instruments surround the fire:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 17
				-
					-
						When now the rage of hunger was repress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With pure libations they conclude the feast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The youths with wine the copious goblets crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The paeans lengthen’d till the sun descends:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 45: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Apollo listens, and approves the song.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						’Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Till rosy morn had purpled o’er the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Supplied by Phoebus, fill the swelling sails;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The parted ocean foams and roars below:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Above the bounding billows swift they flew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Till now the Grecian camp appear’d in view.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then part, where stretch’d along the winding bay,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But raging still, amidst his navy sat
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor mix’d in combat, nor in council join’d;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The gods had summon’d to the Olympian height:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Leads the long order of ethereal powers.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When, like the morning-mist in early day,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And to the seats divine her flight address’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						There, far apart, and high above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						“If e’er, O father of the gods! (she said)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						My words could please thee, or my actions aid,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Some marks of honour on my son bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And pay in glory what in life you owe.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fame is at least by heavenly promise due
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To life so short, and now dishonour’d too.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Till the proud king and all the Achaian race
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 48: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The sacred counsels of his breast conceal’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Still grasp’d his knees, and urged the dear request.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or oh! declare, of all the powers above,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who rolls the thunder o’er the vaulted skies:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What hast thou ask’d? ah, why should Jove engage
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In foreign contests and domestic rage,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The gods’ complaints, and Juno’s fierce alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Go, lest the haughty partner of my sway
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With jealous eyes thy close access survey;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Witness the sacred honours of our head,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The nod that ratifies the will divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The faithful, fix’d, irrevocable sign;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows—”
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 15
				-
					-
						High heaven with trembling the dread signal took,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 51: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And all Olympus to the centre shook.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The shining synod of the immortals wait
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The coming god, and from their thrones of state

						Before the majesty of heaven appear.

					-
						Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						All, but the god’s imperious queen alone:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Late had she view’d the silver-footed dame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And all her passions kindled into flame.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?
					-

					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,

						In vain the partner of imperial state.

				-
					-
						What favourite goddess then those cares divides,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 52: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To this the thunderer: “Seek not thou to find

				-
					-
						The sacred counsels of almighty mind:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 53: Verse 3

						What fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 53: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The first of gods above, and men below;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 53: Verse 7

					-
						But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 53: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deep in the close recesses of my soul.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Full on the sire the goddess of the skies
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Roll’d the large orbs of her majestic eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And thus return’d:—“Austere Saturnius, say,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And all thy counsels take the destined course.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But ’tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In close consult, the silver-footed queen.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What fatal favour has the goddess won,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To grace her fierce, inexorable son?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And glut his vengeance with my people slain.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the god: “O restless fate of pride,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let this suffice: the immutable decree
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But dread the power of this avenging hand:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The united strength of all the gods above
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 55: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A reverent horror silenced all the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The feast disturb’d, with sorrow Vulcan saw
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His mother menaced, and the gods in awe;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus interposed the architect divine:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“The wretched quarrels of the mortal state
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Are far unworthy, gods! of your debate:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Let men their days in senseless strife employ,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						We, in eternal peace and constant joy.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nor break the sacred union of the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless’d abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 15
				-
					-
						If you submit, the thunderer stands appeased;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 56: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The gracious power is willing to be pleased.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The double bowl with sparkling nectar crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Which held to Juno in a cheerful way,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Goddess (he cried), be patient and obey.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Dear as you are, if Jove his arm extend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 6
				-
					-
						I can but grieve, unable to defend.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What god so daring in your aid to move,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or lift his hand against the force of Jove?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Hurl’d headlong down from the ethereal height;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Toss’d all the day in rapid circles round,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nor till the sun descended touch’d the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Breathless I fell, in giddy motion lost;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 57: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which, with a smile, the white-arm’d queen received
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then, to the rest he fill’d; and in his turn,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Each to his lips applied the nectar’d urn,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 58: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And unextinguish’d laughter shakes the skies.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 59
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses round
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With voice alternate aid the silver sound.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Descending swift, roll’d down the rapid light:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then to their starry domes the gods depart,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The shining monuments of Vulcan’s art:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Jove on his couch reclined his awful head,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 59: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And Juno slumber’d on the golden bed.

		-
			Book 2
		-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 1

						Now pleasing sleep had seal’d each mortal eye,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stretch’d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The immortals slumber’d on their thrones above;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 5

						To honour Thetis’ son he bends his care,

						And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:

						Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,

						Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,

						The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						For now no more the gods with fate contend,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						At Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wall,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 8

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This hear observant, and the gods obey!’
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The vision spoke, and pass’d in air away.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To move the troops to measure back the main,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Be mine; and yours the province to detain.”

						He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Nestor, whom Pylos’ sandy realms obey’d,)
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then let us haste, obey the god’s alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pour’d forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And o’er the vale descends the living cloud.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen’d train
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Spreads all the beach, and wide o’ershades the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Along the region runs a deafening sound;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And shining soars, and claps her wings above.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The monarch’s will, suspend the listening crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The king of kings his awful figure raised:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						By Vulcan form’d, from Jove to Hermes came.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To Pelops he the immortal gift resign’d;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						In Atreus’ hand, which not with Atreus ends,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And now the mark of Agamemnon’s reign,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And artful thus pronounced the speech design’d:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader’s care,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of partial Jove with justice I complain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And heavenly oracles believed in vain
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A safe return was promised to our toils,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Renown’d, triumphant, and enrich’d with spoils.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now shameful flight alone can save the host,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						At whose command whole empires rise or fall:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He shakes the feeble props of human trust,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And towns and armies humbles to the dust.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Oh, lasting shame in every future age!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So small their number, that if wars were ceased,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And Greece triumphant held a general feast,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						All rank’d by tens, whole decades when they dine
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But other forces have our hopes o’erthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And Troy prevails by armies not her own.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Since first the labours of this war begun:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Our cordage torn, decay’d our vessels lie,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Our weeping wives, our tender children call:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Love, duty, safety, summon us away,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 32
				-
					-
						’Tis nature’s voice, and nature we obey.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Our shatter’d barks may yet transport us o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 11: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His deep design unknown, the hosts approve
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Atrides’ speech. The mighty numbers move.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From east and south when winds begin to roar,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And as on corn when western gusts descend,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus o’er the field the moving host appears,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With long-resounding cries they urge the train
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To fit the ships, and launch into the main.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The doubling clamours echo to the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						E’en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But Jove’s imperial queen their flight survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And leave unpunish’d this perfidious race?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And bravest chiefs, in Helen’s quarrel slain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 14
			-

					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Pallas obeys, and from Olympus’ height
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For prudent counsel like the gods renown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oppress’d with generous grief the hero stood,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“And is it thus, divine Laertes’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And fame eternal leave to Priam’s race?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Your own resistless eloquence employ,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The voice divine confess’d the warlike maid,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey’d:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Received the imperial sceptre of command.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 15: Verse 8

						The monarch’s will not yet reveal’d appears;

						He tries our courage, but resents our fears.

						The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;

						Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow’d
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 17: Verse 8

						That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.

						To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;

						Back to the assembly roll the thronging train,

						Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,

						At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,

						And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.

						Thersites only clamour’d in the throng,

						Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:—
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But chief he gloried with licentious style
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His figure such as might his soul proclaim;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His mountain shoulders half his breast o’erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Thin hairs bestrew’d his long misshapen head.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And much he hated all, but most the best:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 26
				-
					-
						But royal scandal his delight supreme,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Vex’d when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 18: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Thus with injurious taunts attack’d the throne.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What moves the great Atrides to complain?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						’Tis thine whate’er the warrior’s breast inflames,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o’erflow.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 7

						Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Say, shall we march with our unconquer’d powers
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(The Greeks and I) to Ilion’s hostile towers,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And bring the race of royal bastards here,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For Troy to ransom at a price too dear?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But safer plunder thy own host supplies;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader’s prize?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or, if thy heart to generous love be led,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Whate’er our master craves submit we must,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Plagued with his pride, or punish’d for his lust.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Oh women of Achaia; men no more!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						We may be wanted on some busy day,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						When Hector comes: so great Achilles may:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						From him he forced the prize we jointly gave,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 20
			-

					Book 2: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,

					Book 2: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In generous vengeance of the king of kings.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With indignation sparkling in his eyes,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 20: Verse 4

						He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:

				Book 2: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,

				-
					-
						With wrangling talents form’d for foul debate:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 5

						Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor let those lips profane the name of king.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-

						For our return we trust the heavenly powers;

						Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Except detraction, what hast thou bestow’d?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Suppose some hero should his spoils resign,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And let these eyes behold my son no more;

					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To strip those arms thou ill deserv’st to wear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Expel the council where our princes meet,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The weighty sceptre on his back descends.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While to his neighbour each express’d his thought:
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Great in the council, glorious in the field.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Generous he rises in the crown’s defence,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To curb the factious tongue of insolence,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such just examples on offenders shown,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-

						Sedition silence, and assert the throne.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						’Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The expecting crowds in still attention hung,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His silence thus the prudent hero broke:
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not such at Argos was their generous vow:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ne’er to return, was then the common cry,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Till Troy’s proud structures should in ashes lie.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Behold them weeping for their native shore;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What could their wives or helpless children more?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						What heart but melts to leave the tender train,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, one short month, endure the wintry main?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The tedious length of nine revolving years.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But vanquish’d! baffled! oh, eternal shame!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Expect the time to Troy’s destruction given.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						What pass’d at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Beside a fountain’s sacred brink we raised
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						’Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And curl’d around in many a winding fold;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The topmost branch a mother-bird possess’d;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Eight callow infants fill’d the mossy nest;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Stretch’d his black jaws and crush’d the crying young;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 33
				-
					-
						While hovering near, with miserable moan,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The drooping mother wail’d her children gone.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Nor long survived: to marble turn’d, he stands
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 38
				-
					-
						A lasting prodigy on Aulis’ sands.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Trust in his omen, and support the war.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 41
				-
					-
						For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 44
				-
					-
						‘Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 45
				-
					-
						This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 47
				-
					-
						As many birds as by the snake were slain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 48
				-
					-
						So many years the toils of Greece remain;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 49
				-
					-
						But wait the tenth, for Ilion’s fall decreed:’
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.”
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 53
				-
					-
						He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Then Nestor thus—“These vain debates forbear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Where now are all your high resolves at last?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Vow’d with libations and with victims then,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Now vanish’d like their smoke: the faith of men!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 61
				-
					-
						While useless words consume the unactive hours,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 62
				-
					-
						No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 64
				-
					-
						We march to war, if thou direct the way.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 65
				-
					-
						But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 66
				-
					-
						The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 67
				-
					-
						To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And view with envy our successful wars.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 69
				-
					-
						On that great day, when first the martial train,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Big with the fate of Ilion, plough’d the main,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And thunder rolling shook the firmament.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Till Helen’s woes at full revenged appear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And Troy’s proud matrons render tear for tear.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Before that day, if any Greek invite
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 78
				-
					-
						His country’s troops to base, inglorious flight,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 81
				-
					-
						But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 84
				-
					-
						In tribes and nations to divide thy train:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 85
				-
					-
						His separate troops let every leader call,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 87
				-
					-
						What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,

						When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known

						And what the cause of Ilion not o’erthrown;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 91
				-
					-
						If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,

						If gods above prevent, or men below.”

						To him the king: “How much thy years excel
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But ten such sages as they grant in thee;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Such wisdom soon should Priam’s force destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In fierce contention and in vain debates:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 10

					-
						By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						If e’er as friends we join, the Trojan wall
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And, well refresh’d, to bloody conflict haste.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His sharpen’d spear let every Grecian wield,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And all for combat fit the rattling car.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;

						Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;

					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 23

					-
						Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 24

						With the huge shield each brawny arm depress’d,

				-
					-
						Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 26

						Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Who dares to tremble on this signal day;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 29
				-
					-
						That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 30

			-
				Book 2: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-

						The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,

					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Loud as the surges when the tempest blows,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That dash’d on broken rocks tumultuous roar,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And foam and thunder on the stony shore.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.

						A steer of five years’ age, large limb’d, and fed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To Jove’s high altars Agamemnon led:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Next came Idomeneus, and Tydeus’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The sacred offering of the salted cake:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						“O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Hear! and before the burning sun descends,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Before the night her gloomy veil extends,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Be Priam’s palace sunk in Grecian fires.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 27
				-
					-
						In Hector’s breast be plunged this shining sword,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And slaughter’d heroes groan around their lord!”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Great Jove refused, and toss’d in empty air:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Their prayers perform’d the chiefs the rite pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On these, in double cauls involved with art,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The choicest morsels lie from every part,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The generous Nestor thus the prince address’d.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 29: Verse 4

						And lead to war when heaven directs the way.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said; the monarch issued his commands;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In tribes and nations rank’d on either side.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 5

					-
						High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The dreadful aegis, Jove’s immortal shield,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Blazed on her arm, and lighten’d all the field:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Form’d the bright fringe, and seem’d to burn in gold,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With this each Grecian’s manly breast she warms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 30: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The fires expanding, as the winds arise,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So from the polish’d arms, and brazen shields,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A gleamy splendour flash’d along the fields.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not less their number than the embodied cranes,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or milk-white swans in Asius’ watery plains.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That, o’er the windings of Cayster’s springs,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The legions crowd Scamander’s flowery side;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With rushing troops the plains are cover’d o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Along the river’s level meads they stand,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The wandering nation of a summer’s day:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In gather’d swarms surround the rural bowers;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 23
				-
					-
						From pail to pail with busy murmur run
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 25
				-
					-
						So throng’d, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 26
				-
					-
						In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Each leader now his scatter’d force conjoins
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 28
				-
					-
						In close array, and forms the deepening lines.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The king of kings, majestically tall,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Towers o’er his armies, and outshines them all;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 34
				-
					-
						His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Jove o’er his eyes celestial glories spread,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 31: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And dawning conquest played around his head.
					-

						O say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or urged by wrongs, to Troy’s destruction came.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To count them all, demands a thousand tongues,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-

						A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs.

						Daughters of Jove, assist! inspired by you
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 32: Verse 12

						Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies,

				-
					-
						For this, constrain’d to quit his native place,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 51: Verse 12

						A fleet he built, and with a numerous train

						Where, many seas and many sufferings past,

						The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Since fair Briseis from his arms was torn,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The noblest spoil from sack’d Lyrnessus borne,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then, when the chief the Theban walls o’erthrew,

						Darkening arises from the labour’d ground.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A night of vapours round the mountain heads,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 17

						Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,

						So wrapp’d in gathering dust, the Grecian train,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 22

						When, to the van, before the sons of fame
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 4

					-
						Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:

					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In form a god! the panther’s speckled hide

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 6

						Flow’d o’er his armour with an easy pride:

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His bended bow across his shoulders flung,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 8

						His sword beside him negligently hung;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 10

			-
				Book 3: Stanza 3

						As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,

				-
					-
						He boldly stalk’d, the foremost on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 4

						With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So joys a lion, if the branching deer,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Eager he seizes and devours the slain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Press’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From his high chariot: him, approaching near,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 17

						Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And all confused precipitates his flight:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So from the king the shining warrior flies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So fairly form’d, and only to deceive!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw’st the light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A better fate than vainly thus to boast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thy figure promised with a martial air,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In former days, in all thy gallant pride,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						When thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d the tide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thus from her realm convey’d the beauteous prize,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen’s eyes?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This deed, thy foes’ delight, thy own disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Thy father’s grief, and ruin of thy race;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						This deed recalls thee to the proffer’d fight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Or hast thou injured whom thou dar’st not right?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thou keep’st the consort of a braver foe.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Crush the dire author of his country’s woe.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“’Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thy force, like steel, a temper’d hardness shows,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With which a lover golden Venus arms;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet, would’st thou have the proffer’d combat stand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then let a midway space our hosts divide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And who his rival can in arms subdue,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His be the fair, and his the treasure too.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Advanced with steps majestically slow:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A parley Hector asks, a message bears;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						We know him by the various plume he wears.”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On either host, and thus to both applies:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What Paris, author of the war, demands.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Here in the midst, in either army’s sight,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He dares the Spartan king to single fight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And wills that Helen and the ravish’d spoil,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And different nations part in leagues of peace.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke: in still suspense on either side
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A world engages in the toils of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To me the labour of the field resign;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fall he that must, beneath his rival’s arms;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And live the rest, secure of future harms.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Two lambs, devoted by your country’s rite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To earth a sable, to the sun a white,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-

						Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Select to Jove, the inviolable king.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And add the sanction of considerate age;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And youth itself an empty wavering state;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Cool age advances, venerably wise,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Sees what befell, and what may yet befall,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Concludes from both, and best provides for all.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The nations hear with rising hopes possess’d,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Within the lines they drew their steeds around,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And from their chariots issued on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On either side the meeting hosts are seen
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 8

					-
						With lances fix’d, and close the space between.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 9

						Two heralds now, despatch’d to Troy, invite

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 11: Verse 10

						The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.

						Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring

						The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The various goddess of the rainbow flies:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Like fair Laodice in form and face,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The loveliest nymph of Priam’s royal race:)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Her in the palace, at her loom she found;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The golden web her own sad story crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To whom the goddess of the painted bow:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						“Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Paris alone and Sparta’s king advance,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In single fight to toss the beamy lance;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, the many-coloured maid inspires
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Her husband’s love, and wakes her former fires;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Her country, parents, all that once were dear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O’er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Her handmaids, Clymene and Æthra, wait
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 14: Verse 8

						Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 1

						There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:

					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Old Priam’s chiefs, and most in Priam’s grace,)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And next, the wisest of the reverend throng,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Lean’d on the walls and bask’d before the sun:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But wise through time, and narrative with age,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These, when the Spartan queen approach’d the tower,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						They cried, “No wonder such celestial charms
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						For nine long years have set the world in arms;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						What winning graces! what majestic mien!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 15: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And from destruction save the Trojan race.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Approach, my child, and grace thy father’s side.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The friends and kindred of thy former years.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Not thou, but Heaven’s disposing will, the cause
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The gods these armies and this force employ,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 9

					-
						But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Around whose brow such martial graces shine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So tall, so awful, and almost divine!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 13

						Though some of larger stature tread the green,

					-
						None match his grandeur and exalted mien:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						He seems a monarch, and his country’s pride.”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Before thy presence, father, I appear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With conscious shame and reverential fear.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ah! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						False to my country, and my nuptial bed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						False to them all, to Paris only kind!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						My brother once, before my days of shame!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And oh! that still he bore a brother’s name!”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With wonder Priam view’d the godlike man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Extoll’d the happy prince, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O bless’d Atrides! born to prosperous fate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Successful monarch of a mighty state!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In ancient time, when Otreus fill’d the throne,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Against the manlike Amazons we stood,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But far inferior those, in martial grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, once more he view’d the warrior train;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Though great Atrides overtops his head.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The stately ram thus measures o’er the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And, master of the flock, surveys them round.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Helen thus: “Whom your discerning eyes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A barren island boasts his glorious birth;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Antenor took the word, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						My house was honour’d with each royal guest:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I knew their persons, and admired their parts,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When Atreus’ son harangued the listening train,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Just was his sense, and his expression plain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His modest eyes he fix’d upon the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As one unskill’d or dumb, he seem’d to stand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor raised his head, nor stretch’d his sceptred hand;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The copious accents fall, with easy art;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Wondering we hear, and fix’d in deep surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Our ears refute the censure of our eyes.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What chief is that, with giant strength endued,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						See! bold Idomeneus superior towers
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Great as a god! I saw him once before,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The rest I know, and could in order name;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						One bold on foot, and one renown’d for horse.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						My brothers these; the same our native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						One house contain’d us, as one mother bore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Ashamed to combat in their sister’s cause.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers’ doom;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Adorn’d with honours in their native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Idaeus’ arms the golden goblets press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who thus the venerable king address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Arise, O father of the Trojan state!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The nations call, thy joyful people wait
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Paris, thy son, and Sparta’s king advance,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And who his rival shall in arms subdue,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His be the dame, and his the treasure too.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						So shall the Greeks review their native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To join his milk-white coursers to the car;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The gentle steeds through Scaea’s gates they guide:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Next from the car descending on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Arose, and with him rose the king of men.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On either side a sacred herald stands,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The wine they mix, and on each monarch’s hands
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						From the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The heralds part it, and the princes share;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then loudly thus before the attentive bands
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O first and greatest power! whom all obey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who high on Ida’s holy mountain sway,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From east to west, and view from pole to pole!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Greece returning plough the watery deep.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If by my brother’s lance the Trojan bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And every age record the signal day.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that the chief the tender victims slew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The vital spirit issued at the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And left the members quivering on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And add libations to the powers divine.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While thus their prayers united mount the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						“Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And may their blood, who first the league confound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus either host their imprecations join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The rites now finish’d, reverend Priam rose,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But spare the weakness of my feeble age:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In yonder walls that object let me shun,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor view the danger of so dear a son.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, the hoary king no longer stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The people pray with elevated hands,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And words like these are heard through all the bands:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Immortal Jove, high Heaven’s superior lord,

						On lofty Ida’s holy mount adored!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Whoe’er involved us in this dire debate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						O give that author of the war to fate
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And shades eternal! let division cease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And joyful nations join in leagues of peace.”

				Book 3: Stanza 31

					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then, Paris, thine leap’d forth; by fatal chance
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ordain’d the first to whirl the weighty lance.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Both armies sat the combat to survey.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beside each chief his azure armour lay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In gilded arms magnificently bright:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With flowers adorn’d, with silver buckles bound:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Lycaon’s corslet his fair body dress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His youthful face a polish’d helm o’erspread;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With equal speed and fired by equal charms,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With javelins fix’d, the Greek and Trojan band.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Full on Atrides’ ringing shield it flew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Leap’d from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Atrides then his massy lance prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let this example future times reclaim,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And guard from wrong fair friendship’s holy name,”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He said, and poised in air the javelin sent,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through Paris’ shield the forceful weapon went,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And glancing downward, near his flank descends.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Broke short: the fragments glitter’d on the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The raging warrior to the spacious skies
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 19
				-
					-
						“Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And is it thus the gods assist the just?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies.”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 24
				-
					-
						(Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Struggling he followed, while the embroider’d thong
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 26
				-
					-
						That tied his helmet, dragg’d the chief along.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then had his ruin crown’d Atrides’ joy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 28
				-
					-
						But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And left an empty helmet in his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The Greeks with smiles the polish’d trophy view.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 34
				-
					-
						In thirst of vengeance, at his rival’s heart;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The queen of love her favour’d champion shrouds
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 36
				-
					-
						(For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Raised from the field the panting youth she led,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And gently laid him on the bridal bed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 39
				-
					-
						With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Meantime the brightest of the female kind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The matchless Helen, o’er the walls reclined;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 43
				-
					-
						To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 44
				-
					-
						In borrow’d form, the laughter-loving dame.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 45
				-
					-
						(She seem’d an ancient maid, well-skill’d to cull
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The goddess softly shook her silken vest,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 33: Verse 48
				-
					-
						That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						[Illustration: VENUS, DISGUISED, INVITING HELEN TO THE CHAMBER OF
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						PARIS.]
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Haste, happy nymph! for thee thy Paris calls,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Safe from the fight, in yonder lofty walls,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fair as a god; with odours round him spread,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He lies, and waits thee on the well-known bed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not like a warrior parted from the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But some gay dancer in the public show.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She spoke, and Helen’s secret soul was moved;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						She scorn’d the champion, but the man she loved.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fair Venus’ neck, her eyes that sparkled fire,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And breast, reveal’d the queen of soft desire.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Struck with her presence, straight the lively red
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Forsook her cheek; and trembling, thus she said:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And woman’s frailty always to believe!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Say, to new nations must I cross the main,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or carry wars to some soft Asian plain?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For whom must Helen break her second vow?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						What other Paris is thy darling now?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Left to Atrides, (victor in the strife,)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						An odious conquest and a captive wife,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Hence let me sail; and if thy Paris bear
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 16
				-
					-
						My absence ill, let Venus ease his care.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A handmaid goddess at his side to wait,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Renounce the glories of thy heavenly state,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Be fix’d for ever to the Trojan shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His spouse, or slave; and mount the skies no more.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For me, to lawless love no longer led,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 22
				-
					-
						I scorn the coward, and detest his bed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Else should I merit everlasting shame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And keen reproach, from every Phrygian dame:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ill suits it now the joys of love to know,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 36: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Too deep my anguish, and too wild my woe.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus incensed, the Paphian queen replies:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Obey the power from whom thy glories rise:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Should Venus leave thee, every charm must fly,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Cease to provoke me, lest I make thee more
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The world’s aversion, than their love before;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now the bright prize for which mankind engage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Than, the sad victim, of the public rage.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this, the fairest of her sex obey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And veil’d her blushes in a silken shade;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Unseen, and silent, from the train she moves,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Led by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Arrived, and enter’d at the palace gate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The maids officious round their mistress wait;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then, all dispersing, various tasks attend;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The queen and goddess to the prince ascend.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Full in her Paris’ sight, the queen of love
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Where, as he view’d her charms, she turn’d away
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Her glowing eyes, and thus began to say:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Is this the chief, who, lost to sense of shame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Late fled the field, and yet survives his fame?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of that brave man whom once I call’d my lord!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The boaster Paris oft desired the day
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With Sparta’s king to meet in single fray:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Go now, once more thy rival’s rage excite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Provoke Atrides, and renew the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Yet Helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill’d
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The prince replies: “Ah cease, divinely fair,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor add reproaches to the wounds I bear;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This day the foe prevail’d by Pallas’ power:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						We yet may vanquish in a happier hour:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There want not gods to favour us above;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But let the business of our life be love:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						These softer moments let delights employ,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not thus I loved thee, when from Sparta’s shore
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						My forced, my willing heavenly prize I bore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When first entranced in Cranae’s isle I lay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Mix’d with thy soul, and all dissolved away!”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus having spoke, the enamour’d Phrygian boy
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Rush’d to the bed, impatient for the joy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Him Helen follow’d slow with bashful charms,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And clasp’d the blooming hero in her arms.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While these to love’s delicious rapture yield,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The stern Atrides rages round the field:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So some fell lion whom the woods obey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Roars through the desert, and demands his prey.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Even those had yielded to a foe so brave
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,

						Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown’d,

					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Our brother’s arms the just success have found:

						Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restor’d,

					Book 3: Stanza 41: Verse 14

						Let Argive Helen own her lawful lord;

						The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:

				-
					-
						Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 4

						The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:

						While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ

						When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia’s spleen,

						“Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,

						The tame spectators of his deeds of war.

						“Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!

						“Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate

						But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate

						None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.

						No mortals merit more distinguish’d grace

						Than godlike Priam, or than Priam’s race.

						Still to our name their hecatombs expire,

				Book 4: Stanza 6

					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-

						At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,

					-
						Then on the Thunderer fix’d them, and replies:

						“Three towns are Juno’s on the Grecian plains,

			-
				Book 4: Stanza 7

						’Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;

						The crime’s sufficient that they share my love.

						Of power superior why should I complain?

						A goddess born, to share the realms above,

					-
						Nor thou a wife and sister’s right deny;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Let both consent, and both by terms comply;

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 7: Verse 12

						So shall the gods our joint decrees obey,

						To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,

						The sire of men and monarch of the sky

						Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ

						To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.

						Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,

						And shot like lightning from Olympus’ height.

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-

						As the red comet, from Saturnius sent

				-
					-
						With sweeping glories glides along in air,

						Between both armies thus, in open sight

					Book 4: Stanza 8: Verse 14

						(In shape a mortal,) pass’d disguised along.

						Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,

					-
						Who from Antenor traced his high descent.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Amidst the ranks Lycaon’s son she found,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown’d;

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose squadrons, led from black Æsepus’ flood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With flaming shields in martial circle stood.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To him the goddess: “Phrygian! canst thou hear
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan’s heart?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thy country’s foe, the Grecian glory slain?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 20

						On Zelia’s altars, to the god of day.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His polish’d bow with hasty rashness seized.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						’Twas form’d of horn, and smooth’d with artful toil:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A mountain goat resign’d the shining spoil.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And sixteen palms his brow’s large honours spread:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The workmen join’d, and shaped the bended horns,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And beaten gold each taper point adorns.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Screen’d by the shields of his surrounding friends:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						There meditates the mark; and couching low,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						One from a hundred feather’d deaths he chose,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Apollo’s altars in his native town.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till the barb’d points approach the circling bow;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 1

						But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour

				-
					-
						The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Diverts the weapon from its destined course:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The watchful mother wafts the envenom’d fly.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Just where his belt with golden buckles join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where linen folds the double corslet lined,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						She turn’d the shaft, which, hissing from above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 10

						Pass’d the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						As when some stately trappings are decreed
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						With equal lustre various colours vie,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So great Atrides! show’d thy sacred blood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						As down thy snowy thigh distill’d the streaming flood.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With horror seized, the king of men descried
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The shaft infix’d, and saw the gushing tide:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor less the Spartan fear’d, before he found
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The shining barb appear above the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The royal brother thus his grief express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And grasp’d his hand; while all the Greeks around
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						With answering sighs return’d the plaintive sound.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And faith is scorn’d by all the perjured line.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not thus our vows, confirm’d with wine and gore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 9

					-
						Shall all be vain: when Heaven’s revenge is slow,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The day shall come, that great avenging day,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						When Troy’s proud glories in the dust shall lay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When Priam’s powers and Priam’s self shall fall,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And one prodigious ruin swallow all.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						I see the god, already, from the pole
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						I see the Eternal all his fury shed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And shake his aegis o’er their guilty head.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But thou, alas! deserv’st a happier fate.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Still must I mourn the period of thy days,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And only mourn, without my share of praise?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 27
				-
					-
						While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 28
				-
					-
						(And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 29
				-
					-
						‘Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And such the conquest of her king of kings!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 31
				-

						Lo his proud vessels scatter’d o’er the main,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.’
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 33
				-

						Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 13: Verse 34

						O’erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch’s shame.”
					-
			-

			-

				-
					-
						He said: a leader’s and a brother’s fears
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Stiff with the rich embroider’d work around,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						My varied belt repell’d the flying wound.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom the king: “My brother and my friend,

				-
					-
						Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His speedy succour to the Spartan king;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Grecian’s sorrow, and the Dardan’s joy.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In arms incircled with his native bands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then thus: “Machaon, to the king repair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His wounded brother claims thy timely care;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A grief to us, a triumph to the foe.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And all the chiefs in deep concern around.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where to the steely point the reed was join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then suck’d the blood, and sovereign balm infused,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Which Chiron gave, and Æsculapius used.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Once more the fields are fill’d with dire alarms.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor had you seen the king of men appear
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But fond of glory, with severe delight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His beating bosom claim’d the rising fight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						No longer with his warlike steeds he stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or press’d the car with polish’d brass inlaid
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fiery coursers snorted at his side.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						On foot through all the martial ranks he moves
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And these encourages, and those reproves.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						“Brave men!” he cries, (to such who boldly dare
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Your ancient valour on the foes approve;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						’Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Prepared for flight, but doom’d to fly in vain?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, he stalk’d with ample strides along,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To Crete’s brave monarch and his martial throng;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						High at their head he saw the chief appear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And bold Meriones excite the rear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At this the king his generous joy express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And clasp’d the warrior to his armed breast.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To thee the foremost honours are decreed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						First in the fight and every graceful deed.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Restore our blood, and raise the warriors’ souls,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Unmix’d, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.”
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To whom the Cretan thus his speech address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						“Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Fix’d to thy side, in every toil I share,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Thy firm associate in the day of war.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But let the signal be this moment given;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 20: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And chains or death avenge the impious deed.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Charm’d with this heat, the king his course pursues,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And next the troops of either Ajax views:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A cloud of heroes blacken’d all the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus from the lofty promontory’s brow
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A swain surveys the gathering storm below;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To the close covert of an arching rock.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With spears erect, a moving iron wood:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Exclaim’d the king), who raise your eager bands
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With great examples, more than loud commands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 5

						Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 23: Verse 7

					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then to the next the general bends his course;

					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(His heart exults, and glories in his force);
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And with inspiring eloquence commands;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With strictest order sets his train in arms,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-

						The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.

				-
					-
						Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The horse and chariots to the front assign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The middle space suspected troops supply,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He gives command to “curb the fiery steed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Before the rest let none too rashly ride;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He whom the fortune of the field shall cast
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Content with javelins to provoke the war.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Our great forefathers held this prudent course,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 25
				-
					-
						By laws like these immortal conquests made,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 24: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And earth’s proud tyrants low in ashes laid.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke the master of the martial art,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And touch’d with transport great Atrides’ heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But wasting years, that wither human race,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And age the lot of any chief but thee.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The field of combat fits the young and bold,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The solemn council best becomes the old:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To you the glorious conflict I resign,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said. With joy the monarch march’d before,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The tumult late begun, they stood intent
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To watch the motion, dubious of the event.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Can Peleus’ son forget a warrior’s part.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And fears Ulysses, skill’d in every art?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Why stand you distant, and the rest expect
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From you ’twas hoped among the first to dare
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The shock of armies, and commence the war;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For this your names are call’d before the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To share the pleasures of the genial feast:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Say, is it thus those honours you requite?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The first in banquets, but the last in fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ulysses heard: the hero’s warmth o’erspread
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior’s due,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who dares to act whate’er thou dar’st to view.”
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O great in action, and in council wise!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Sage as thou art, and learn’d in human kind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Forgive the transport of a martial mind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and pass’d where great Tydides lay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With hands unactive, and a careless eye?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Still first in front the matchless prince appear’d:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Who view’d him labouring through the ranks of fight?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae’s towers;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Armies he ask’d, and armies had been given,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						While dreadful comets glaring from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Forewarn’d the horrors of the Theban war.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						A fearless envoy, he approach’d the foes;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thebes’ hostile walls unguarded and alone,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And dared to combat all those chiefs around:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 26
				-
					-
						For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Stung with the shame, within the winding way,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Two heroes led the secret squadron on,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Those fifty slaughter’d in the gloomy vale.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 32
				-
					-
						He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 31: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						No words the godlike Diomed return’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But heard respectful, and in secret burn’d:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not so fierce Capaneus’ undaunted son;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Our value equal, though our fury less.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With fewer troops we storm’d the Theban wall,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In impious acts the guilty father died;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Far more than heirs of all our parents’ fame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Our glories darken their diminish’d name.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him Tydides thus: “My friend, forbear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His high concern may well excuse this rage,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His the first praise, were Ilion’s towers o’erthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						’Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of arm’d Tydides rushing to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when the winds, ascending by degrees,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						First move the whitening surface of the seas,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The billows float in order to the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The wave behind rolls on the wave before;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Foam o’er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So to the fight the thick battalions throng,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						No sound, no whisper, but the chief’s commands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						As if some god had snatch’d their voice away.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A general shout that all the region rends.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 19
				-
					-
						As when the fleecy flocks unnumber’d stand
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In wealthy folds, and wait the milker’s hand,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Such clamours rose from various nations round,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Mix’d was the murmur, and confused the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 26
				-
					-
						These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And discord raging bathes the purple plain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Small at her birth, but rising every hour,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 31
				-
					-
						While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 32
				-
					-
						She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The nations bleed, where’er her steps she turns,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 35: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.

				-
					-
						To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-

						The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,

						Victors and vanquish’d join’d promiscuous cries,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Rush to the vales, and pour’d along the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Roar through a thousand channels to the main:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At great Echepolus the lance arrives,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Warm’d in the brain the brazen weapon lies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And shades eternal settle o’er his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of force and fire, its walls besmear’d with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Seized to despoil, and dragg’d the corpse along:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Agenor’s javelin reach’d the hero’s heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The war renews, the warriors bleed again:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						As o’er their prey rapacious wolves engage,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 38: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Amid the flocks on silver Simois’ shore:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To seek her parents on his flowery side,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So falls a poplar, that in watery ground
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Raised high the head, with stately branches crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(Fell’d by some artist with his shining steel,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With all its beauteous honours on its head
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 17
				-
					-
						There, left a subject to the wind and rain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And scorch’d by suns, it withers on the plain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 39: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Stretch’d on the shore, and thus neglected dies.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The pointed lance with erring fury flew,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Arm’d with his spear, he meditates the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In act to throw; but cautious look’d around,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Old Priam’s son, Democoon was his name.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The weapon entered close above his ear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						E’en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But Phoebus now from Ilion’s towering height
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shines forth reveal’d, and animates the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb’d with steel;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Have ye forgot what seem’d your dread before?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Apollo thus from Ilion’s lofty towers,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Array’d in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While war’s fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And shouts and thunders in the fields below.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In vain his valour and illustrious line.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						(Who from cold Ænus led the Thracian crew,)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Full on his ankle dropp’d the ponderous stone,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Burst the strong nerves, and crash’d the solid bone.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Before his helpless friends, and native bands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The foe rush’d furious as he pants for breath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And through his navel drove the pointed death:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And the warm life came issuing from the wound.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Deep in his breast above the pap it went,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amid the lungs was fix’d the winged wood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till from the dying chief, approaching near,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The Ætolian warrior tugg’d his weighty spear:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And gash’d his belly with a ghastly wound;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The Thracian bands against the victor press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A grove of lances glitter’d at his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 43: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And one the leader of the Epeian race;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Death’s sable shade at once o’ercast their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In dust the vanquish’d and the victor lies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With copious slaughter all the fields are red,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And heap’d with growing mountains of the dead.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Might darts be bid to turn their points away,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And swords around him innocently play;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The war’s whole art with wonder had he seen,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And counted heroes where he counted men.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.

		-
			Book 5
		-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But Pallas now Tydides’ soul inspires,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And crown her hero with distinguish’d praise.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						High on his helm celestial lightnings play,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His beamy shield emits a living ray;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow’d:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Onward she drives him, furious to engage,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The sons of Dares first the combat sought,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In Vulcan’s fane the father’s days were led,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						These singled from their troops the fight maintain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And spent in empty air its erring force.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But pierced his breast, and stretch’d him on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He too had sunk to death’s eternal shade;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But in a smoky cloud the god of fire
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When by the blood-stain’d hand Minerva press’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The god of battles, and this speech address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While we from interdicted fields retire,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 6

						Nor tempt the wrath of heaven’s avenging sire.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Her words allay the impetuous warrior’s heat,

				-
					-
						The god of arms and martial maid retreat;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 3

						Removed from fight, on Xanthus’ flowery bounds

						They sat, and listen’d to the dying sounds.

				Book 5: Stanza 6

					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And some bold chieftain every leader slew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His death ennobled by Atrides’ hand:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As he to flight his wheeling car address’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom’d to feel
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The great Idomeneus’ protended steel;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The Cretan javelin reach’d him from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And everlasting shades his eyes surround.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But vainly here Diana’s arts he tries,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From Menelaus’ arm the weapon sent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His brazen armour rings against the ground.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy father’s skill, O Phereclus! was thine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The graceful fabric and the fair design;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To him the shipwright’s and the builder’s art.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The fatal cause of all his country’s woes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor saw his country’s peril, nor his own.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The hapless artist, while confused he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Between the bladder and the bone it pass’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						From Meges’ force the swift Pedaeus fled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Antenor’s offspring from a foreign bed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nursed the young stranger with a mother’s care.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Full in his nape infix’d the fatal spear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sprung from the brave Dolopion’s mighty line,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Who near adored Scamander made abode,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						On him, amidst the flying numbers found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thence glancing downwards, lopp’d his holy hand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Which stain’d with sacred blood the blushing sand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress’d his breath.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus toil’d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rapt through the ranks he thunders o’er the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through ruin’d moles the rushing wave resounds,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						O’erwhelm’s the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The yellow harvests of the ripen’d year,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And all the labours of mankind are vain.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With grief the leader of the Lycian band
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His bended bow against the chief he drew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						While the proud archer thus exulting cried:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.”
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Stopp’d short of life, and mock’d the shooter’s art.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The wounded chief, behind his car retired,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The helping hand of Sthenelus required;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Swift from his seat he leap’d upon the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And tugg’d the weapon from the gushing wound;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When thus the king his guardian power address’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The purple current wandering o’er his vest:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O progeny of Jove! unconquer’d maid!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						If e’er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If e’er I felt thee in the fighting field;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard’st in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus pray’d Tydides, and Minerva heard,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His nerves confirm’d, his languid spirits cheer’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His beating bosom claim’d the promised fight.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						War be thy province, thy protection mine;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Rush to the fight, and every foe control;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And set to view the warring deities.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						If Venus mingle in the martial band,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing’d her flight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The hero rush’d impetuous to the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If chance some shepherd with a distant dart
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then leaps victorious o’er the lofty mound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And two brave leaders at an instant slew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His people’s pastor, good Hypenor, died;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Astynous’ breast the deadly lance receives,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Hypenor’s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Abas and Polyidus to engage;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The youths return’d not from the doubtful plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And the sad father tried his arts in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 25
				-
					-
						No mystic dream could make their fates appear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Though now determined by Tydides’ spear.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The joy and hope of Phaenops’ feeble age:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of all his labours and a life of cares.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming years,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And leaves the father unavailing tears:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To strangers now descends his heapy store,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The race forgotten, and the name no more.

				-
					-
						Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when the lordly lion seeks his food
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 8

						Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.

						Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall’d fame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And boasted glory of the Lycian name?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 11

						Whoe’er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-

						If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him the Lycian: “Whom your eyes behold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Such coursers whirl him o’er the dusty field,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If ’tis a god, he wears that chief’s disguise:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						I wing’d an arrow, which not idly fell,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The stroke had fix’d him to the gates of hell;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And, but some god, some angry god withstands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His fate was due to these unerring hands.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Skill’d in the bow, on foot I sought the war,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor join’d swift horses to the rapid car.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ten polish’d chariots I possess’d at home,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And still they grace Lycaon’s princely dome:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 17
				-
					-
						There veil’d in spacious coverlets they stand;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And twice ten coursers wait their lord’s command.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The good old warrior bade me trust to these,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 20
				-
					-
						When first for Troy I sail’d the sacred seas;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 24
				-
					-
						I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Might fail of forage in the straiten’d town;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 27
				-
					-
						So took my bow and pointed darts in hand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And left the chariots in my native land.

						“Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;

						Tydeus’ and Atreus’ sons their points have found,

					-
						In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In evil hour these bended horns I strung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And seized the quiver where it idly hung.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Without a warrior’s arms, the spear and shield!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						If e’er with life I quit the Trojan plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						If e’er I see my spouse and sire again,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-

						Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.”

				-
					-
						“Be calm, nor Phoebus’ honour’d gift disgrace.

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The distant dart be praised, though here we need

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 5

						Against yon hero let us bend our course,

						And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.

						Now mount my seat, and from the chariot’s height
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Observe my father’s steeds, renown’d in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 12

					-
						Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The warrior’s fury let this arm sustain;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 15

					-
						Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-

						Take thou the spear, the chariot’s care be mine.”

			-
				Book 5: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 1

					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;

					-
						Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who thus, alarm’d, to great Tydides cried:

			-
				Book 5: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon’s line,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And save a life, the bulwark of our war.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this the hero cast a gloomy look,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fix’d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Know, ’tis not honest in my soul to fear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						I hate the cumbrous chariot’s slow advance,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the long distance of the flying lance;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 14
				-
					-
						That both shall fall by one victorious hand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then heed my words: my horses here detain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fix’d to the chariot by the straiten’d rein;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Swift to Æneas’ empty seat proceed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The race of those, which once the thundering god
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 20
				-
					-
						For ravish’d Ganymede on Tros bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The best that e’er on earth’s broad surface run,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Beneath the rising or the setting sun.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 24
				-
					-
						By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Four of this race his ample stalls contain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And two transport Æneas o’er the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 27
				-
					-
						These, were the rich immortal prize our own,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Through the wide world should make our glory known.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And stern Lycaon’s warlike race begun:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The spear may enter where the arrow fail’d.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!”
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ye ’scape not both; one, headlong from his car,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 9

						With hostile blood shall glut the god of war.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and rising hurl’d his forceful dart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full in his face it enter’d, and betwixt
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Crash’d all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Till the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The starting coursers tremble with affright;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To guard his slaughter’d friend, Æneas flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His spear extending where the carcase lies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						As the grim lion stalks around his prey.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O’er the fall’n trunk his ample shield display’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He hides the hero with his mighty shade,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 9

					-
						Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Such men as live in these degenerate days:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;

					-
						Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 18

						Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;

						There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway’d,

				-
					-
						Oppress’d had sunk to death’s eternal shade,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 26
				-

					-
						His danger views with anguish and despair,

						Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Screen’d from the foe behind her shining veil,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Safe through the rushing horse, and feather’d flight
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Remain’d unheedful of his lord’s commands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His panting steeds, removed from out the war,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He fix’d with straiten’d traces to the car,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						These in proud triumph to the fleet convey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						No longer now a Trojan lord obey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And follow’d where Tydides swept the plain.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						No goddess she, commission’d to the field,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						New to the field, and still a foe to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And at the goddess his broad lance extends;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the transparent skin with crimson stain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						From the clear vein a stream immortal flow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Such stream as issues from a wounded god;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						(For not the bread of man their life sustains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Nor wine’s inflaming juice supplies their veins:)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With tender shrieks the goddess fill’d the place,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And dropp’d her offspring from her weak embrace.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 37: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The king insults the goddess as she flies:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Ill with Jove’s daughter bloody fights agree,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The field of combat is no scene for thee:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Taught by this stroke renounce the war’s alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And learn to tremble at the name of arms.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The queen of love with faded charms she found.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pale was her cheek, and livid look’d the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Beside him stood his lance, distain’d with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, rein’d with gold, his foaming steeds before.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Low at his knee, she begg’d with streaming eyes
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Her brother’s car, to mount the distant skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And show’d the wound by fierce Tydides given,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And to her hand commits the golden rein;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 17
				-
					-
						She mounts the seat, oppress’d with silent woe,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And in a moment scales the lofty skies:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 21
				-
					-
						They stopp’d the car, and there the coursers stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Before her mother, love’s bright queen appears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 24
				-
					-
						O’erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 25
				-
					-
						She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 39: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And ask’d what god had wrought this guilty deed?
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then she: “This insult from no god I found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						An impious mortal gave the daring wound!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Behold the deed of haughty Diomed!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Twas in the son’s defence the mother bled.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But with the gods (the immortal gods) engage.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Dione then: “Thy wrongs with patience bear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And share those griefs inferior powers must share:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Unnumber’d woes mankind from us sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And men with woes afflict the gods again.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And lodged in brazen dungeons underground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full thirteen moons imprison’d roar’d in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Otus and Ephialtes held the chain:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Perhaps had perish’d had not Hermes’ care
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Restored the groaning god to upper air.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Great Juno’s self has borne her weight of pain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The imperial partner of the heavenly reign;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Amphitryon’s son infix’d the deadly dart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And fill’d with anguish her immortal heart.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						E’en hell’s grim king Alcides’ power confess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The shaft found entrance in his iron breast;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To Jove’s high palace for a cure he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Pierced in his own dominions of the dead;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Where Paeon, sprinkling heavenly balm around,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Assuaged the glowing pangs, and closed the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Rash, impious man! to stain the bless’d abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 41: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And drench his arrows in the blood of gods!
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“But thou (though Pallas urged thy frantic deed),

				-
					-
						Whose spear ill-fated makes a goddess bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 3

					-
						Know thou, whoe’er with heavenly power contends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Short is his date, and soon his glory ends;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 5

						From fields of death when late he shall retire,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thy distant wife, Ægiale the fair,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Starting from sleep with a distracted air,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The brave, the great, the glorious now no more!”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, she wiped from Venus’ wounded palm
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The sacred ichor, and infused the balm.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Juno and Pallas with a smile survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 43: Verse 4

					-
						And thus to Jove began the blue-eyed maid:

			-
				Book 5: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! to tell
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As late she tried with passion to inflame
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The tender bosom of a Grecian dame;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To quit her country for some youth of Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 44: Verse 8

						Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The sire of gods and men superior smiled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, calling Venus, thus address’d his child:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Flush’d with celestial blood pursued his way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fearless dared the threatening god of day;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Already in his hopes he saw him kill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Though screen’d behind Apollo’s mighty shield.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						How vast the difference of the gods and thee;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Distance immense! between the powers that shine
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A short-lived reptile in the dust of earth.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus’ race
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To Troy’s high fane, and to his holy place;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Latona there and Phoebe heal’d the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With vigour arm’d him, and with glory crown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This done, the patron of the silver bow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A phantom raised, the same in shape and show
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With great Æneas; such the form he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Meantime on Ilion’s tower Apollo stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Rise in thy wrath! to hell’s abhorr’d abodes
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The wretch would brave high heaven’s immortal sire,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.”

					-
						The god of battle issues on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Enraged to Troy’s retiring chiefs he cried:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And unrevenged see Priam’s people die?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Lo, brave Æneas sinks beneath his wound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Not godlike Hector more in arms renown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Haste all, and take the generous warrior’s part.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He said;—new courage swell’d each hero’s heart.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Sarpedon first his ardent soul express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, turn’d to Hector, these bold words address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That propp’d alone by Priam’s race should stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Troy’s sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Remote they stand while alien troops engage,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Like trembling hounds before the lion’s rage.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Far distant hence I held my wide command,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With those I left whatever dear could be:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 17
				-
					-
						While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten’d state,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Or one vast burst of all-involving fate
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Full o’er your towers shall fall, and sweep away
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish’d prey.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 24
				-
					-
						These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 52: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But just reproof with decent silence bears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Two shining spears are brandish’d in his hands;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus arm’d, he animates his drooping bands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 9
				-

						They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 53: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when, on Ceres’ sacred floor, the swain

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The grey dust, rising with collected winds,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Drives o’er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So white with dust the Grecian host appears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The dusky clouds from labour’d earth arise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Mars hovers o’er them with his sable shield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And adds new horrors to the darken’d field:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In Troy’s defence, Apollo’s heavenly will:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Produced Æneas to the shouting train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Alive, unharm’d, with all his peers around,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 22
				-
					-
						No pause of words admits, no dull delay;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 54: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field’s in flames.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Serenely dreadful, and as fix’d as fate.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So when the embattled clouds in dark array,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Along the skies their gloomy lines display;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 55: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor was the general wanting to his train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Your brave associates and yourselves revere!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On valour’s side the odds of combat lie,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These words he seconds with his flying lance,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To meet whose point was strong Deicoon’s chance:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Æneas’ friend, and in his native place
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Honour’d and loved like Priam’s royal race:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Long had he fought the foremost in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But now the monarch’s lance transpierced his shield:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The grisly wound dismiss’d his soul to hell,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 57: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His arms around him rattled as he fell.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then fierce Æneas, brandishing his blade,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sprung from Alpheus’ plenteous stream, that yields
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And these descended in the third degree.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Too early expert in the martial toil,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In sable ships they left their native soil,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 12
				-
					-
						They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Till pierced at distance from their native den,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 18
				-
					-
						O’erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The god but urged him to provoke his fate.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 25
				-
					-
						He thus advancing, Nestor’s valiant son
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Struck with the thought, should Helen’s lord be slain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And all his country’s glorious labours vain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Already met, the threatening heroes stand;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The spears already tremble in their hand:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 31
				-
					-
						In rush’d Antilochus, his aid to bring,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 33
				-
					-
						These seen, the Dardan backward turn’d his course,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Brave as he was, and shunn’d unequal force.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 58: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 59
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 1
				-
					-
						First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Atrides mark’d him where sublime he stood;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fix’d in his throat the javelin drank his blood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The faithful Mydon, as he turn’d from fight
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A broken rock by Nestor’s son was thrown:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His bended arm received the falling stone;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From his numb’d hand the ivory-studded reins,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dropp’d in the dust, are trail’d along the plains:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The head stood fix’d, the quivering legs in air,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Till trampled flat beneath the coursers’ feet:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 59: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 60
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He fires his host with animating cries,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And brings along the furies of the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Where Hector march’d, the god of battles shined,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 60: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Now storm’d before him, and now raged behind.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 61
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Tydides paused amidst his full career;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then first the hero’s manly breast knew fear.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And foam impervious ’cross the wanderer’s way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Confused he stops, a length of country pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 61: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He stay’d, and turning thus address’d his bands:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His strokes they second, and avert our spears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Retire, but with your faces to the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Trust not too much your unavailing might;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 62: Verse 8
				-
					-
						’Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 63
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In every art of glorious war renown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And fought united, and united died.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His massy spear with matchless fury sent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Through Amphius’ belt and heaving belly went;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Amphius Apaesus’ happy soil possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With herds abounding, and with treasure bless’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But fate resistless from his country led
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The chief, to perish at his people’s head.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Around his head an iron tempest rain’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A wood of spears his ample shield sustain’d:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He could no more; the showering darts denied
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 24
				-
					-
						With bristling lances, and compacted shields;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Till in the steely circle straiten’d round,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 63: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 64
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Urged by the force of unresisted fate,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Burns with desire Sarpedon’s strength to prove;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Alcides’ offspring meets the son of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Jove’s great descendant, and his greater son.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 64: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 65
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 6
				-
					-
						How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 8
				-
					-
						No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With six small ships, and but a slender train,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He left the town a wide-deserted plain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But what art thou, who deedless look’st around,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 14
				-
					-
						While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 65: Verse 18
				-
					-
						I make this present to the shades below.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 66
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 66: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 66: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 67
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Thy sire, O prince! o’erturn’d the Trojan state,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 4
				-
					-
						False he detain’d, the just reward of war.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor so content, the generous chief defied,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With base reproaches and unmanly pride.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But you, unworthy the high race you boast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 67: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Add one more ghost to Pluto’s gloomy reign.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 68
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: both javelins at an instant flew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon’s slew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full in the boaster’s neck the weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Transfix’d his throat, and drank the vital blood;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 68: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And his seal’d eyes for ever lose the light.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 69
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sarpedon’s thigh, had robb’d the chief of breath;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But Jove was present, and forbade the death.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The wounded hero dragg’d the lance along.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(His friends, each busied in his several part,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whose fall Ulysses view’d, with fury fired;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Doubtful if Jove’s great son he should pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But heaven and fate the first design withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor this great death must grace Ulysses’ hand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew’d the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Rush’d terrible amidst the ranks of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With joy Sarpedon view’d the wish’d relief,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 69: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 70
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O suffer not the foe to bear away
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 2
				-
					-
						My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If I, unbless’d, must see my son no more,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 4
				-
					-
						My much-loved consort, and my native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet let me die in Ilion’s sacred wall;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 70: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 71
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 71: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 71: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 71: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 71: Verse 4

						And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.

				-
					-
						Beneath a beech, Jove’s consecrated shade,

				-
					-
						His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Brave Pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who wrench’d the javelin from his sinewy thigh.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The fainting soul stood ready wing’d for flight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And o’er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 72: Verse 8

						None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 73: Verse 4

						Who first, who last, by Mars’ and Hector’s hand,

						Tenthras the great, Orestes the renown’d

						Next OEnomaus and OEnops’ offspring died;

						Oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,

						In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway,

				-
					-
						Thou too no less hast been my constant care;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 84: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy hands I arm’d, and sent thee forth to war:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 84: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;

				-

						Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 85: Verse 8

				-
					-
						For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,

					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 86
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 86: Verse 1

					Book 5: Stanza 86: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Not Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.

						Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 86: Verse 5

					-
						Rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 86: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And every side of wavering combat tries;

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 86: Verse 7

					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Drew from his seat the martial charioteer.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The vigorous power the trembling car ascends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 5

					-
						The groaning axle bent beneath the load;

					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So great a hero, and so great a god.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 7
				-
					-
						She snatch’d the reins, she lash’d with all her force,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 87: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Black Orcus’ helmet o’er her radiant head.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 88

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The strongest warrior of the Ætolian train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stretch’d where he fell, and at Tydides flies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full at the chief, above his courser’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From Mars’s arm the enormous weapon fled:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Far from the car the strong immortal lance.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then threw the force of Tydeus’ warlike son;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The javelin hiss’d; the goddess urged it on:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 14
				-
					-
						It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 15
				-
					-
						From the rent skin the warrior tugs again
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 18
				-
					-
						When shouting millions shake the thundering field.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 19
				-

						Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As vapours blown by Auster’s sultry breath,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Choke the parch’d earth, and blacken all the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In such a cloud the god from combat driven,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 26
				-
					-
						High o’er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 28
				-
					-
						There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Show’d the celestial blood, and with a groan
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 88: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Thus pour’d his plaints before the immortal throne:

					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Can Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,

				-
					-
						And brook the furies of this daring day?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For mortal men celestial powers engage,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 4

						And gods on gods exert eternal rage:

					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From thee, O father! all these ills we bear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thou gavest that fury to the realms of light,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 89: Verse 8

					-
						With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						All Greece recedes, and ’midst her triumphs fears;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus aloud: “Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And you whom distant nations send to war!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor shall, I trust, the matrons’ holy train,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.”
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, with ample strides the hero pass’d;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The shield’s large orb behind his shoulder cast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His neck o’ershading, to his ankle hung;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And as he march’d the brazen buckler rung.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus’ son
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Between both armies met: the chiefs from far
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Observed each other, and had mark’d for war.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:

			-
				Book 6: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What art thou, boldest of the race of man?

				-
					-
						Our eyes till now that aspect ne’er beheld,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where fame is reap’d amid the embattled field;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet far before the troops thou dar’st appear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,
					-
				-

						Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!

						Not long Lycurgus view’d the golden light,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						That daring man who mix’d with gods in fight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Bacchus, and Bacchus’ votaries, he drove,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With brandish’d steel, from Nyssa’s sacred grove:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Their consecrated spears lay scatter’d round,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And Thetis’ arms received the trembling god.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor fail’d the crime the immortals’ wrath to move;
					-

					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 19
				-
					-
						(The immortals bless’d with endless ease above;)
					-

					-
						Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,

				-
					-
						Cheerless he breathed, and wander’d in the gloom,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!
					-
				-

					-
						I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth

						Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,

						Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey’d.

						With direful jealousy the monarch raged,

					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For him Antaea burn’d with lawless flame,

						And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:

						In vain she tempted the relentless youth,

						Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.

					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 17

						Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,

						A mingled monster of no mortal kind!

						A goat’s rough body bore a lion’s head;

					-
						If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,

						In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,

						Opposed to those, where Priam’s daughters sate.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 16

					-
						Of equal beauty, and of polish’d stone.

				-
					-
						The various textures and the various dyes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						She chose a veil that shone superior far,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And glow’d refulgent as the morning star.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Antenor’s consort, fair Theano, waits

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						As Pallas’ priestess, and unbars the gates.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						They fill the dome with supplicating cries.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 26: Verse 21

					-
						The priestess then the shining veil displays,

						“Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Troy’s strong defence, unconquer’d Pallas, aid!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Break thou Tydides’ spear, and let him fall
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,

				-
					-
						Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!”
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 27: Verse 9

						So pray’d the priestess in her holy fane;

						Hector to Paris’ lofty dome repairs.

				-
					-
						Himself the mansion raised, from every part

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-

					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of full ten cubits was the lance’s length,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The steely point with golden ringlets join’d,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 10

					-
						Before him brandish’d, at each motion shined

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His eyes delighting with their splendid show,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Brightening the shield, and polishing the bow.

						Beside him Helen with her virgins stands,

				-
					-
						Whose virtue charm’d him as her beauty fired,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Stood in the gates, and ask’d “what way she bent
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Her parting step? If to the fane she went,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where late the mourning matrons made resort;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?”
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor mix’d with matrons to Minerva’s fane:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To Ilion’s steepy tower she bent her way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						She heard, and trembled for her absent lord:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Distracted with surprise, she seem’d to fly,

			-
				Book 6: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Hector this heard, return’d without delay;

				-
					-
						Swift through the town he trod his former way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Through streets of palaces, and walks of state;

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 4

					-
						And met the mourner at the Scaean gate.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 5

						His blameless wife, Aetion’s wealthy heir

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 7

					-
						(Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway’d,
					-
				-

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 10

					-
						Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.
					-
				-

						To this loved infant Hector gave the name
					-
				-

						Scamandrius, from Scamander’s honour’d stream;

				-
					-
						To tender passions all his mighty mind;

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 36: Verse 21

					-
						Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,

						A widow I, a helpless orphan he?

						So shall my days in one sad tenor run,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 37: Verse 12

						No parent now remains my griefs to share,

					-
						No father’s aid, no mother’s tender care.

					-
						The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,

				-
					-
						Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 37: Verse 17

						His fate compassion in the victor bred;

					-
						Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And laid him decent on the funeral pile;

					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Hush’d to repose, and with a smile survey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						She mingled with a smile a tender tear.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The soften’d chief with kind compassion view’d,

					-
						“Andromache! my soul’s far better part,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 46: Verse 5

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.

						Through all her train the soft infection ran;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But now, no longer deaf to honour’s call,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The wanton courser thus with reins unbound
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pamper’d and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He snuffs the females in the distant plain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And springs, exulting, to his fields again.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In arms refulgent as the god of day,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The son of Priam, glorying in his might,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 47: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Rush’d forth with Hector to the fields of fight.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now, the warriors passing on the way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The graceful Paris first excused his stay.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To whom the noble Hector thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thy power in war with justice none contest;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess’d.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or godlike Paris live a woman’s slave!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These ills shall cease, whene’er by Jove’s decree
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 15
				-
					-
						While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 48: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Greece indignant through her seas returns.”

						So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then rush’d impetuous through the Scaean gate.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Him Paris follow’d to the dire alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when to sailors labouring through the main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 7

						Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;

						The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.

						So welcome these to Troy’s desiring train,

						Bold Paris first the work of death begun
					-

				-
					-
						On great Menestheus, Areithous’ son,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Sprung from the fair Philomeda’s embrace,
					-
				-

						The pleasing Arne was his native place.

						Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full on his neck, from Hector’s weighty hand;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 8

						And roll’d, with limbs relax’d, along the land.

						By Glaucus’ spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,

						Nor shot less swift from Ilion’s towery height.

						Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-

						Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This day, the business of the field suspend;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-

						Since vengeful goddesses confederate join

						To her the god: “Great Hector’s soul incite

					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 7

				Book 7: Stanza 6

						At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;

						Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 7

				-
					-
						To mortal combat on the listed plain.

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 11

						For not this day shall end thy glorious date;

						The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.”

			-
				Book 7: Stanza 7

					-
						In form of vultures, on the beech’s height

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 9: Verse 10

				-
					-
						Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But let my body, to my friends return’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn’d.

					Book 7: Stanza 9: Verse 23

						Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,

						And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:

						That not a Grecian met this noble foe!

						Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 11: Verse 8

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-

						That day, Atrides! a superior hand

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 4

					-
						Had stretch’d thee breathless on the hostile strand;

					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But all at once, thy fury to compose,

						The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;

						Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press’d
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy daring hand, and this advice address’d:

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?

					-
						Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-

						Great Hector’s arm is mightier far than thine:

					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Even fierce Achilles learn’d its force to fear,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And trembling met this dreadful son of war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-

						Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 12: Verse 16

				-
					-
						No longer bent to rush on certain harms;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 14

				-
					-
						He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thus to the kings he spoke: “What grief, what shame
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Once with what joy the generous prince would hear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of every chief who fought this glorious war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Participate their fame, and pleased inquire
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Each name, each action, and each hero’s sire!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And trembling all before one hostile hand;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						How would he lift his aged arms on high,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Years might again roll back, my youth renew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And give this arm the spring which once it knew
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When fierce in war, where Jardan’s waters fall,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						I led my troops to Phea’s trembling wall,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Proud Areithous’ dreadful arms to wield;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Great Areithous, known from shore to shore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Nor aught the warrior’s thundering mace avail’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Had given the vanquish’d, now the victor bore:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 37
				-
					-
						But when old age had dimm’d Lycurgus’ eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 38
				-
					-
						To Ereuthalion he consign’d the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Furious with this he crush’d our levell’d bands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And dared the trial of the strongest hands;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 42
				-
					-
						All saw, and fear’d, his huge tempestuous sway
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Till I, the youngest of the host, appear’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 45
				-
					-
						I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Prone fell the giant o’er a length of ground.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 47
				-
					-
						What then I was, O were your Nestor now!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Not Hector’s self should want an equal foe.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 49
				-
					-
						But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 14: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Up-started fierce: but far before the rest
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Oileus follow’d; Idomen was there,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						All these, alike inspired with noble rage,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His country’s fame, his own immortal praise.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The lots produced, each hero signs his own:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then in the general’s helm the fates are thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And vows like these ascend from all the bands:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A worthy champion for the Grecian state:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.”
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Leap’d forth the lot, of every Greek desired.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This from the right to left the herald bears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Held out in order to the Grecian peers;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then casts before him, and with transport cries:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To Saturn’s son be all your vows address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Said I in secret? No, your vows declare
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In such a voice as fills the earth and air,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, born to combats, fear no force on earth.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said. The troops with elevated eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O father of mankind, superior lord!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throne,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That both may claim it, and that both may share.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He moves to combat with majestic pace;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus march’d the chief, tremendous as a god;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His massy javelin quivering in his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Through every Argive heart new transport ran;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						’Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						As from a brazen tower, o’erlook’d the field.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o’ercast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell’d
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And in all arts of armoury excell’d,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This Ajax bore before his manly breast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hector! approach my arm, and singly know
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Not void of soul, and not unskill’d in war:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sends thee one, a sample of her host,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						No more—be sudden, and begin the fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O son of Telamon, thy country’s pride!

				-
					-
						(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						New to the field, and trembling at the fight?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 5

						Thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy arms,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 7

						I know to shift my ground, remount the car,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 8

					-
						Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And bear thick battle on my sounding shield/
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But open be our fight, and bold each blow;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						I steal no conquest from a noble foe.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and rising, high above the field
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whirl’d the long lance against the sevenfold shield.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full on the brass descending from above
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till in the seventh it fix’d. Then Ajax threw;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Through Hector’s shield the forceful javelin flew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His corslet enters, and his garment rends,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The blunted point against the buckler bends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;

						It reach’d his neck, with matchless strength impell’d!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The hollow brass resounded with the shock:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 28
				-
					-
						With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 30
				-
					-
						His slacken’d knees received the numbing stroke;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Great Hector falls extended on the field,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His bulk supporting on the shatter’d shield:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo’s might
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Confirm’d his sinews, and restored to fight.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 36
				-
					-
						In flaming circles round their heads they flew;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 37
				-
					-
						But then by heralds’ voice the word was given.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 24: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And first Idaeus’ awful voice was heard:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To either host your matchless worth is known,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But now the Night extends her awful shade;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The goddess parts you; be the night obey’d.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom great Ajax his high soul express’d:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“O sage! to Hector be these words address’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Let him demand the sanction of the night;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If first he ask’d it, I content obey,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And cease the strife when Hector shows the way.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin’d)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With strength of body, and with worth of mind!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now martial law commands us to forbear;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And let the gods decide of death or life!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector’s life.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But let us, on this memorable day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						‘Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.’”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow’d
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A radiant belt that rich with purple glow’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And hail with joy the Champion of their state;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Alive, unarm’d, and vigorous from his wound;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To Troy’s high gates the godlike man they bear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their present triumph, as their late despair.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The well-arm’d Greeks to Agamemnon lead.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A steer for sacrifice the king design’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.

				-
					-
						The king himself (an honorary sign)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When now the rage of hunger was removed,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The sage whose counsels long had sway’d the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 30: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In words like these his prudent thought express’d:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What Greeks are perish’d! what a people lost!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What tides of blood have drench’d Scamander’s shore!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow’s light
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Some space at least permit the war to breathe,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						While we to flames our slaughter’d friends bequeath,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From the red field their scatter’d bodies bear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And pious children o’er their ashes weep.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						High o’er them all a general tomb be raised;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						From space to space be ample gates around,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For passing chariots; and a trench profound.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So Greece to combat shall in safety go,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.”
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						’Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 31: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meanwhile, convened at Priam’s palace-gate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A senate void of order, as of choice:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						’Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And I but move what every god requires:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Let Sparta’s treasures be this hour restored,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Our impious battles the just gods provoke.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						As this advice ye practise, or reject,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						So hope success, or dread the dire effect.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But sound ungrateful in a warrior’s ears:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Old man, if void of fallacy or art,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But wisdom has its date, assign’d by heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Their treasures I’ll restore, but not the dame;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But be this bright possession ever mine.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						’Twas then, the growing discord to compose,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His godlike aspect deep attention drew:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He paused, and these pacific words ensue:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Now take refreshment as the hour demands;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Before their ships proclaim my son’s intent.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Next let a truce be ask’d, that Troy may burn
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Her slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The words of Troy, and Troy’s great monarch, hear.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What Paris, author of the war, declares.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Oh had he perish’d ere they touch’d our shore!)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He proffers injured Greece: with large increase
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But to restore the beauteous bride again,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Our slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
					-

						And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their proffer’d wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And Troy already totters to her fall.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-

						Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:

					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Herald! in him thou hear’st the voice of Greece

				-

					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 6

					-
						With heroes’ corps: I war not with the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And gratify the manes of the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!”
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He said, and rear’d his sceptre to the sky.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To wait the event, the herald bent his way.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He came, and standing in the midst, explain’d
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The peace rejected, but the truce obtain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Hew’d the green forests, and the bodies bore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And now from forth the chambers of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To shed his sacred light on earth again,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Arose the golden chariot of the day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And tipp’d the mountains with a purple ray.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Through heaps of carnage search’d the mournful plain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Scarce could the friend his slaughter’d friend explore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With dust dishonour’d, and deformed with gore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The wounds they wash’d, their pious tears they shed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Sage Priam check’d their grief: with silent haste
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The bodies decent on the piles were placed:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With melting hearts the cold remains they burn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And decent on the pile dispose the dead;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The cold remains consume with equal care;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Now, ere the morn had streak’d with reddening light
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The doubtful confines of the day and night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 29
				-
					-
						About the dying flames the Greeks appear’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And round the pile a general tomb they rear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 32
				-
					-
						They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 33
				-
					-
						From space to space were ample gates around,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 34
				-
					-
						For passing chariots, and a trench profound
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Of large extent; and deep in earth below,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 40: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Strong piles infix’d stood adverse to the foe.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So toil’d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In shining circle round their father Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If the proud Grecians thus successful boast
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						See the long walls extending to the main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No god consulted, and no victim slain!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Their fame shall fill the world’s remotest ends,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While old Laomedon’s divine abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.”
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make
					-

				-
					-
						The solid earth’s eternal basis shake!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What cause of fear from mortal works could move
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The meanest subject of our realms above?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Where’er the sun’s refulgent rays are cast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy power is honour’d, and thy fame shall last.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But yon proud work no future age shall view,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						No trace remain where once the glory grew.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-

						The sapp’d foundations by thy force shall fall,

					-
						And, whelm’d beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:

					-
						Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:

					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 44
			-

					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus they in heaven: while, o’er the Grecian train,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The rolling sun descending to the main
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beheld the finish’d work. Their bulls they slew;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 5

						And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos’ strands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With Bacchus’ blessings cheered the generous bands.
					-

						Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent

						A thousant measures to the royal tent.

						The rest they purchased at their proper cost,

					-
						And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:

					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Each, in exchange, proportion’d treasures gave;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 14

						Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.

						All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:

						Those on the fields, and these within their towers.

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But Jove averse the signs of wrath display’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 20
				-
					-
						While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 44: Verse 21

					-
						Each pour’d to Jove before the bowl was crown’d;

				-
					-
						And large libations drench’d the thirsty ground:

				-
					-
						Then late, refresh’d with sleep from toils of fight,
					-

						Enjoy’d the balmy blessings of the night.

						Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						O’er heaven’s clear azure spread the sacred light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Commutual death the fate of war confounds,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With equal hand: in these explored the fate
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Press’d with its load, the Grecian balance lies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then Jove from Ida’s top his horrors spreads;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The clouds burst dreadful o’er the Grecian heads;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Unwilling he remain’d, for Paris’ dart
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Fix’d in the forehead, where the springing mane
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Curl’d o’er the brow, it stung him to the brain;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The encumber’d chariot from the dying steed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Pour’d to the tumult on his whirling car.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						That day had stretch’d beneath his matchless hand
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						He rush’d, and on Ulysses call’d aloud:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes’ son!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Mix’d with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oh turn and save from Hector’s direful rage
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.”
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A single warrior midst a host of foes;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Before the coursers with a sudden spring
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He leap’d, and anxious thus bespoke the king:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						These younger champions will oppress thy might.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Observe the steeds of Tros, renown’d in war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						These late obey’d Æneas’ guiding rein;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With these against yon Trojans will we go,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The thirsty fury of my flying spear.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill’d in war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The reverend charioteer directs the course,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl’d his spear.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The spear with erring haste mistook its way,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But plunged in Eniopeus’ bosom lay.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Till, to supply his place and rule the car,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And now had death and horror cover’d all;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Roll’d the big thunder o’er the vast profound:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Full in Tydides’ face the lightning flew;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And Nestor’s trembling hand confess’d his fright:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						He dropp’d the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thus, turning, warn’d the intrepid Diomed:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O chief! too daring in thy friend’s defence
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Some other sun may see the happier hour,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						’Tis not in man his fix’d decree to move:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The great will glory to submit to Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						O’erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior’s shame!”
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						“Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian’s pride?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord.”
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He said, and, hasty, o’er the gasping throng
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						“Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Now hope no more those honours from thy train;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Go less than woman, in the form of man!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thrice turn’d the chief, and thrice imperial Jove
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On Ida’s summits thunder’d from above.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,

				-
					-
						All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 3

						Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,

						Your great forefathers’ glories, and your own.

					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						High o’er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And pass victorious o’er the levell’d mound.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 13: Verse 14

				Book 8: Stanza 14

					Book 8: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Furious he said; then bending o’er the yoke,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:

						“Now, Xanthus, Æthon, Lampus, urge the chase,

			-
				Book 8: Stanza 16

					Book 8: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I war not with the highest. All above
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken’d shields.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where the deep trench in length extended lay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The king of men, by Juno’s self inspired,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Toil’d through the tents, and all his army fired.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His purple robe, bright ensign of command.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						High on the midmost bark the king appear’d:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						There, from Ulysses’ deck, his voice was heard:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To Ajax and Achilles reach’d the sound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But who to meet one martial man is found,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 24
				-
					-
						When the fight rages, and the flames surround?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 25
				-
					-
						O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress’d!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Was ever king like me, like me oppress’d?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 27
				-
					-
						With power immense, with justice arm’d in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 28
				-
					-
						My glory ravish’d, and my people slain!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 29
				-
					-
						To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 30
				-
					-
						What altar smoked not with our victims’ gore?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And ask’d destruction to the Trojan name.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Give these at least to ’scape from Hector’s hand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 18: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And save the relics of the Grecian land!”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus pray’d the king, and heaven’s great father heard
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr’d:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And gives the people to their monarch’s prayers.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A fawn his talons truss’d, (divine portent!)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						High o’er the wondering hosts he soar’d above,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then let the prey before his altar fall;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						O’er the broad ditch impell’d his foaming horse,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With flying coursers shunn’d his dreadful ire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Meriones, like Mars in arms renown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Evaemon’s son next issues to the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And last young Teucer with his bended bow.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Secure behind the Telamonian shield
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The skilful archer wide survey’d the field,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With every shaft some hostile victim slew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Retires for safety to the mother’s arms.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Who first by Teucer’s mortal arrows bled?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The godlike Lycophon next press’d the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The bloody pile great Melanippus crown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 44
				-
					-
						A Trojan ghost attending every dart.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 47
				-
					-
						“O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Thy country’s saviour, and thy father’s boast!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Sprung from an alien’s bed thy sire to grace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Proud of his boy, he own’d the generous flame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And the brave son repays his cares with fame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Now hear a monarch’s vow: If heaven’s high powers
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Give me to raze Troy’s long-defended towers;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Whatever treasures Greece for me design,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The next rich honorary gift be thine:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 60
				-
					-
						With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 19: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Shall recompense the warrior’s toils with love.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To this the chief: “With praise the rest inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor urge a soul already fill’d with fire.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What strength I have, be now in battle tried,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Still aim’d at Hector have I bent my bow:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But sure some god denies me to destroy
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This fury of the field, this dog of Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and twang’d the string. The weapon flies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At Hector’s breast, and sings along the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He miss’d the mark; but pierced Gorgythio’s heart,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And drench’d in royal blood the thirsty dart.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						This offspring added to king Priam’s line.)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Another shaft the raging archer drew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						That other shaft with erring fury flew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(From Hector, Phoebus turn’d the flying wound,)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And dipp’d its feathers in no vulgar gore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Hector with grief his charioteer beheld
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And rush’d on Teucer with the lifted rock.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The youth already strain’d the forceful yew;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The shaft already to his shoulder drew;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The feather in his hand, just wing’d for flight,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Touch’d where the neck and hollow chest unite;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 29
				-
					-
						There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And his numb’d hand dismiss’d his useless bow.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 33
				-
					-
						He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And screen’d his brother with the mighty shade;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 21: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The batter’d archer groaning to the shore.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He arm’d their hands, and fill’d their breasts with fire.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						First of the foe, great Hector march’d along,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With beating bosom, and with eager pace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus oft the Grecians turn’d, but still they flew;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When flying they had pass’d the trench profound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Before the ships a desperate stand they made,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						That wither’d all their host: like Mars he stood:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then pensive thus, to war’s triumphant maid:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now, in this moment of her last despair,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 5

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-

						Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 8

					-
						What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 23: Verse 9

						What power divine shall Hector’s wrath assuage?

						Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spake the imperial regent of the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Long since had Hector stain’d these fields with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stretch’d by some Argive on his native shore:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Forgets my service and deserved reward:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By stern Eurystheus with long labours press’d?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He begg’d, with tears he begg’d, in deep dismay;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						When to grim Pluto’s gloomy gates he went;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The triple dog had never felt his chain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor Styx been cross’d, nor hell explored in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 15

					-
						At Thetis’ suit the partial Thunderer nods;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 21

						When Juno’s self, and Pallas shall appear,

				-
					-
						All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 27
				-
					-
						What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 25: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 1

				-
					-
						(Heaven’s awful empress, Saturn’s other heir:)
					-

						Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,

					-
						With flowers adorn’d, with art immortal crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Her father’s arms her mighty limbs invest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-

						Close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day

						But Jove, incensed, from Ida’s top survey’d,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And each immortal nerve with horror shake.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 34: Verse 25

						Where on her utmost verge the seas resound;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fast by the brink, within the streams of hell;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						No sun e’er gilds the gloomy horrors there;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						There arm once more the bold Titanian band;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And drew behind the cloudy veil of night:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The victors keep the field; and Hector calls
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A martial council near the navy walls;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						These to Scamander’s bank apart he led,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where thinly scatter’d lay the heaps of dead.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Attend his order, and their prince surround.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A massy spear he bore of mighty strength,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of full ten cubits was the lance’s length;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The point was brass, refulgent to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Fix’d to the wood with circling rings of gold:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The noble Hector on his lance reclined,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, bending forward, thus reveal’d his mind:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye valiant Trojans, with attention hear!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ye Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the field, high blazing to the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not unmolested let the wretches gain
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses’ care.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And warn their children from a Trojan war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To bid the sires with hoary honours crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And beardless youths, our battlements surround.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The insidious foe the naked town invade.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 32
				-
					-
						A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector’s hand
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 34
				-
					-
						From these detested foes to free the land,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Who plough’d, with fates averse, the watery way:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 36
				-
					-
						For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Our common safety must be now the care;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 38
				-
					-
						But soon as morning paints the fields of air,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 43
				-
					-
						To-morrow’s light (O haste the glorious morn!)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 45
				-
					-
						With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 48
				-
					-
						From age inglorious, and black death secure;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 49
				-
					-
						So might my life and glory know no bound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Like Pallas worshipp’d, like the sun renown’d!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 51
				-
					-
						As the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Shall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The leader spoke. From all his host around
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shouts of applause along the shores resound.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fix’d their headstalls to his chariot-side.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whose wrath hung heavy o’er the Trojan towers:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor Priam nor his sons obtain’d their grace;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Proud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The troops exulting sat in order round,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And beaming fires illumined all the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O’er heaven’s pure azure spreads her sacred light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Around her throne the vivid planets roll,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						O’er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And tip with silver every mountain’s head:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The long reflections of the distant fires
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And shoot a shady lustre o’er the field.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Whose umber’d arms, by fits, thick flashes send,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Loud neigh the coursers o’er their heaps of corn,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.

				Book 9: Stanza 1

						Thus joyful Troy maintain’d the watch of night;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Sat on each face, and sadden’d every heart.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A double tempest of the west and north
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Swells o’er the sea, from Thracia’s frozen shore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						This way and that the boiling deeps are toss’d:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Such various passions urged the troubled host,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Superior sorrows swell’d his royal breast;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Himself his orders to the heralds bears,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To bid to council all the Grecian peers,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In solemn sadness and majestic grief.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The king amidst the mournful circle rose:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So silent fountains, from a rock’s tall head,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Words, mix’d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader’s care;

				-
					-
						Fellows in arms and princes of the war!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of partial Jove too justly we complain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And heavenly oracles believed in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A safe return was promised to our toils,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 6

					-
						With conquest honour’d and enrich’d with spoils:

						Now shameful flight alone can save the host;

						Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,

					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And towers and armies humbles to the dust.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Haste to the joys our native country yields;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 16

				-
					-
						Silent, unmov’d in dire dismay they stand;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A pensive scene! till Tydeus’ warlike son
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Roll’d on the king his eyes, and thus begun:

						“When kings advise us to renounce our fame,

						Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,

					-
						Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:
					-

					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The gods have made thee but by halves a king:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						They gave dominion o’er the seas and land;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The noblest power that might the world control
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 19

					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 21

						Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;

						And if we fly, ’tis what our king commands.

						Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;

						Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;

						Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;

					-
						Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 30

						God bade us fight, and ’twas with God we came.”

						He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And voice to voice resounds Tydides’ praise.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He spoke: the host in still attention heard:

			-
				Book 9: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O truly great! in whom the gods have join’d
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Such strength of body with such force of mind:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In conduct, as in courage, you excel,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Still first to act what you advise so well.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Applauding Greece with common voice approves.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And yet those years that since thy birth have run
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Would hardly style thee Nestor’s youngest son.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then let me add what yet remains behind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 14

				-
					-
						“Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,

						Unworthy property, unworthy light,

				-
					-
						Unfit for public rule, or private care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To tear his country, and his kind destroy!

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 7

						This night, refresh and fortify thy train;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Between the trench and wall let guards remain:

				-
					-
						Be that the duty of the young and bold;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But thou, O king, to council call the old;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 11

					-
						Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With Thracian wines recruit thy honour’d guests,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And such a monarch as can choose the best.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This dreadful interval determines all;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall.”

				Book 9: Stanza 7

					-
						Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;

					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His son was first to pass the lofty mound,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The double offspring of the warrior-god:

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Lycomed of Creon’s noble line.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.

						The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,

				-
					-
						Some line the trench, and others man the wall.

			-
				Book 9: Stanza 8

				-
					-
						The king of men, on public counsels bent,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Convened the princes in his ample tent,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But stay’d his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And slowly rising, thus the council moved.
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 9

					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 1

					-
						“Monarch of nations! whose superior sway

						The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,

					-
						And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 5

						O king! the counsels of my age attend;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,

				-
					-
						Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To see no wholesome motion be withstood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And ratify the best for public good.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						At once my present judgment and my past.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When from Pelides’ tent you forced the maid,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend.”

						To whom the king. “With justice hast thou shown

						A prince’s faults, and I with reason own.

				-
					-
						That happy man, whom Jove still honours most,

				-
					-
						Is more than armies, and himself a host.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-

						Bless’d in his love, this wondrous hero stands;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 7

						Fain would my heart, which err’d through frantic rage,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 9

						Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And twice ten vases of refulgent mould:

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Twelve steeds unmatch’d in fleetness and in force,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And still victorious in the dusty course;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						(Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Skill’d in each art, unmatch’d in form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The same I chose for more than vulgar charms,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						When Lesbos sank beneath the hero’s arms:

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						All these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And join’d with these the long-contested maid;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With all her charms, Briseis I resign,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And solemn swear those charms were never mine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Untouch’d she stay’d, uninjured she removes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						These instant shall be his; and if the powers

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Give to our arms proud Ilion’s hostile towers,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						With gold and brass his loaded navy’s sides:

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Such as himself will choose; who yield to none,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Or yield to Helen’s heavenly charms alone.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Yet hear me further: when our wars are o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 38
				-
					-
						If safe we land on Argos’ fruitful shore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 39
				-
					-
						There shall he live my son, our honours share,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And with Orestes’ self divide my care.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Yet more—three daughters in my court are bred,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And each well worthy of a royal bed;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Laodice and Iphigenia fair,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 46
				-
					-
						I ask no presents, no reward for love:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Myself will give the dower; so vast a store
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 48
				-
					-
						As never father gave a child before.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Seven ample cities shall confess his sway,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Him Enope, and Pherae him obey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Cardamyle with ample turrets crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And sacred Pedasus for vines renown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And rich Antheia with her flowery fields:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The whole extent to Pylos’ sandy plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Along the verdant margin of the main.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 57
				-
					-
						There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Bold are the men, and generous is the soil;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 59
				-
					-
						There shall he reign, with power and justice crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And rule the tributary realms around.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 61
				-
					-
						All this I give, his vengeance to control,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And sure all this may move his mighty soul.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Lives dark and dreadful in deep hell’s abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And mortals hate him, as the worst of gods.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Great though he be, it fits him to obey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 10: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Since more than his my years, and more my sway.”

				-
					-
						“Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Such are thy offers as a prince may take,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And such as fits a generous king to make.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let chosen delegates this hour be sent

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Myself will name them) to Pelides’ tent.

						Let Phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,

						Great Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.

					-
						Yet more to sanctify the word you send,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Let Hodius and Eurybates attend.

					-
						Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 12

						Pray in deep silence, and with purest hands.”

						The cleansing water from the living spring.

						The youth with wine the sacred goblets crown’d,

				-
					-
						And large libations drench’d the sands around.

					-
						The rite perform’d, the chiefs their thirst allay,

						Then from the royal tent they take their way;

						Wise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,

						Forbids to offend, instructs them to apply;

				-
					-
						And calm the rage of stern Æacides.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Amused at ease, the godlike man they found,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Pleased with the solemn harp’s harmonious sound.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Of polish’d silver was its costly frame.)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Patroclus only of the royal train,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Full opposite he sat, and listen’d long,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						In silence waiting till he ceased the song.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Leap’d from his seat, and laid the harp aside.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 33
				-
					-
						With like surprise arose Menoetius’ son:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 12: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Pelides grasp’d their hands, and thus begun:
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To me more dear than all that bear the name.”
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then thus—“Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Mix purer wine, and open every soul.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of all the warriors yonder host can send,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend.”
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: Patroclus o’er the blazing fire
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The brazen vase Automedon sustains,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Achilles at the genial feast presides,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The tent is brighten’d with the rising blaze:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then, when the languid flames at length subside,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Above the coals the smoking fragments turns
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With bread the glittering canisters they load,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Which round the board Menoetius’ son bestow’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Each portion parts, and orders every rite.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The first fat offering to the immortals due,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then each, indulging in the social feast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His thirst and hunger soberly repress’d.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 21
				-
					-
						That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Not unperceived; Ulysses crown’d with wine
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 15: Verse 24
				-
					-
						His speech addressing to the godlike man.
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Not those more honour’d whom Atrides feasts:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That, Agamemnon’s regal tent affords;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And owns no help but from thy saving hands:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Their threatening tents already shade our wall:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And point at every ship their vengeful flame!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For them the father of the gods declares,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Heavens! how my country’s woes distract my mind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design’d!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 27
				-
					-
						To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 28
				-
					-
						If in that heart or grief or courage lies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 31
				-
					-
						That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 34
				-
					-
						When Peleus in his aged arms embraced
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 16: Verse 35
				-
					-
						His parting son, these accents were his last:
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“‘My child! with strength, with glory, and success,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From gentler manners let thy glory grow,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And shun contention, the sure source of woe;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						That young and old may in thy praise combine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The virtues of humanity be thine—’
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						This now-despised advice thy father gave;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						If thou wilt yield to great Atrides’ prayers,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If not—but hear me, while I number o’er
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The proffer’d presents, an exhaustless store.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And still victorious in the dusty course;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Skill’d in each art, unmatch’d in form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 26
				-
					-
						When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 27
				-
					-
						All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And, join’d with these, the long-contested maid;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With all her charms, Briseis he’ll resign,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And solemn swear those charms were only thine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Untouch’d she stay’d, uninjured she removes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 33
				-
					-
						These instant shall be thine; and if the powers
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Give to our arms proud Ilion’s hostile towers,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 36
				-
					-
						With gold and brass thy loaded navy’s sides.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 38
				-
					-
						With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Or yield to Helen’s heavenly charms alone.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Yet hear me further: when our wars are o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 42
				-
					-
						If safe we land on Argos’ fruitful shore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 43
				-
					-
						There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And with Orestes’ self divide his care.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Yet more—three daughters in his court are bred,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And each well worthy of a royal bed:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Laodice and Iphigenia fair,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 50
				-
					-
						He asks no presents, no reward for love:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Himself will give the dower; so vast a store
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 52
				-
					-
						As never father gave a child before.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The Enope and Pherae thee obey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Cardamyle with ample turrets crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The whole extent to Pylos’ sandy plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Along the verdant margin of the main.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 61
				-
					-
						There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 63
				-
					-
						There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And rule the tributary realms around.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Such are the proffers which this day we bring,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Such the repentance of a suppliant king.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 67
				-
					-
						But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 68
				-
					-
						If honour and if interest plead in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 71
				-
					-
						If no regard thy suffering country claim,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 73
				-
					-
						For now that chief, whose unresisted ire
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 17: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And only triumphs to deserve thy hands.”
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the goddess-born: “Ulysses, hear
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What in my secret soul is understood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Who dares think one thing, and another tell,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 18: Verse 8

						My heart detests him as the gates of hell.

				-
					-
						Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;

					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,

				-
					-
						But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The wretch and hero find their prize the same.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Alike regretted in the dust he lies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						As the bold bird her helpless young attends,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From danger guards them, and from want defends;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In search of prey she wings the spacious air,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And with the untasted food supplies her care:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						I sack’d twelve ample cities on the main,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then at Atrides’ haughty feet were laid
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Your mighty monarch these in peace possess’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Some present, too, to every prince was paid;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And every prince enjoys the gift he made:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						I only must refund, of all his train;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						See what pre-eminence our merits gain!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 30
				-
					-
						My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 32
				-
					-
						But what’s the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 33
				-
					-
						What to these shores the assembled nations draws,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 34
				-
					-
						What calls for vengeance but a woman’s cause?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Are fair endowments and a beauteous face
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Beloved by none but those of Atreus’ race?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Sure every wise and worthy man will love.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Wrong’d in my love, all proffers I disdain;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Ye have my answer—what remains to do,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 45
				-
					-
						What needs he the defence this arm can make?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Has he not walls no human force can shake?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Has he not fenced his guarded navy round
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 48
				-
					-
						With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And will not these (the wonders he has done)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Repel the rage of Priam’s single son?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 51
				-
					-
						There was a time (’twas when for Greece I fought)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 52
				-
					-
						When Hector’s prowess no such wonders wrought;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 53
				-
					-
						He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Achilles’ fury at the Scaean gate;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 55
				-
					-
						He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 56
				-
					-
						But now those ancient enmities are o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 57
				-
					-
						To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Then shall you see our parting vessels crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 61
				-
					-
						If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Pythia to her Achilles shall restore
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The wealth he left for this detested shore:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 66
				-
					-
						My beauteous captives thither I’ll convey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And all that rests of my unravish’d prey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 68
				-
					-
						One only valued gift your tyrant gave,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And that resumed—the fair Lyrnessian slave.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 72
				-
					-
						(For arm’d in impudence, mankind he braves,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Nor share his council, nor his battle join;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 78
				-
					-
						For once deceiv’d, was his; but twice were mine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 79
				-
					-
						No—let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 81
				-
					-
						His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Not though he proffer’d all himself possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And all his rapine could from others wrest:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The many-peopled Orchomenian town;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Not all proud Thebes’ unrivall’d walls contain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 88
				-
					-
						The world’s great empress on the Egyptian plain
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 89
				-
					-
						(That spreads her conquests o’er a thousand states,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 90
				-
					-
						And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 92
				-
					-
						From each wide portal issuing to the wars);
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Though bribes were heap’d on bribes, in number more
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Should all these offers for my friendship call,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 96
				-
					-
						’Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Atrides’ daughter never shall be led
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 98
				-
					-
						(An ill-match’d consort) to Achilles’ bed;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Like golden Venus though she charm’d the heart,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And vied with Pallas in the works of art;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 102
				-
					-
						I hate alliance with a tyrant’s race.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 103
				-
					-
						If heaven restore me to my realms with life,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 104
				-
					-
						The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 106
				-
					-
						And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Bless’d in kind love, my years shall glide away,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Content with just hereditary sway;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 109
				-
					-
						There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Not all Apollo’s Pythian treasures hold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Can bribe the poor possession of a day!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And steeds unrivall’d on the dusty plain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 117
				-
					-
						But from our lips the vital spirit fled,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Returns no more to wake the silent dead.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 119
				-
					-
						My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 120
				-
					-
						And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Short is my date, but deathless my renown:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 123
				-
					-
						If I return, I quit immortal praise
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 124
				-
					-
						For years on years, and long-extended days.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 126
				-
					-
						And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 127
				-
					-
						To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Jove’s arm display’d asserts her from the skies!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Her hearts are strengthen’d, and her glories rise.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Go then to Greece, report our fix’d design;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 134
				-
					-
						To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 135
				-
					-
						One stratagem has fail’d, and others will:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Ye find, Achilles is unconquer’d still.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Go then—digest my message as ye may—
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 138
				-
					-
						But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 139
				-
					-
						His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 140
				-
					-
						A peaceful death in Pythia’s friendly land.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 141
				-
					-
						But whether he remain or sail with me,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 19: Verse 142
				-
					-
						His age be sacred, and his will be free.”
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In silence wrapt, in consternation drown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Attend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With accent weak these tender words return’d.
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						How shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The royal Peleus, when from Pythia’s coast
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He sent thee early to the Achaian host;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And new to perils of the direful field:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He bade me teach thee all the ways of war,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No time shall part us, and no fate divide,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						My father faithless to my mother’s arms,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Old as he was, adored a stranger’s charms.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						I tried what youth could do (at her desire)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To win the damsel, and prevent my sire.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						My sire with curses loads my hated head,
					-
				-

					-
						And cries, ‘Ye furies! barren be his bed.’
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And ruthless Proserpine, confirm’d his vow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Gods! what a crime my impious heart design’d!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 27
				-
					-
						I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress’d)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To plunge the poniard in my father’s breast;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain
					-
				-

					-
						On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 32
				-
					-
						They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Strong guards they placed, and watch’d nine nights entire;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And, favour’d by the night, o’erleap’d the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 37
				-
					-
						My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 38
				-
					-
						In Phthia’s court at last my labours end.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Your sire received me, as his son caress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With gifts enrich’d, and with possessions bless’d.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The strong Dolopians thenceforth own’d my reign,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And all the coast that runs along the main.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 43
				-
					-
						By love to thee his bounties I repaid,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And early wisdom to thy soul convey’d:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 46
				-
					-
						A child I took thee, but a hero gave.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Thy infant breast a like affection show’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Or at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 50
				-
					-
						No food was grateful but from Phoenix’ hand.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 51
				-
					-
						I pass my watchings o’er thy helpless years,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The tender labours, the compliant cares,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And Phoenix felt a father’s joys in thee:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Thy growing virtues justified my cares,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And promised comfort to my silver hairs.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign’d;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 58
				-
					-
						A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The gods (the only great, and only wise)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Offending man their high compassion wins,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And daily prayers atone for daily sins.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Prayers are Jove’s daughters, of celestial race,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 65
				-
					-
						With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Constant they follow, where injustice flies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o’er mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 69
				-
					-
						While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 71
				-
					-
						For him they mediate to the throne above:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 72
				-
					-
						When man rejects the humble suit they make,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The sire revenges for the daughters’ sake;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 74
				-
					-
						From Jove commission’d, fierce injustice then
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Descends to punish unrelenting men.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 76
				-
					-
						O let not headlong passion bear the sway
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 77
				-
					-
						These reconciling goddesses obey:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Due honours to the seed of Jove belong,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Were rage still harbour’d in the haughty king;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 84
				-
					-
						But since what honour asks the general sends,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The best and noblest of the Grecian train;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 89
				-
					-
						A great example drawn from times of old;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 21: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Who conquer’d their revenge in former days.
					-

					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands
					-

					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Once fought the Ætolian and Curetian bands;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 8

					-
						That levell’d harvests, and whole forests tore:

					-
						This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)

				-
					-
						Great Meleager stretch’d along the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail’d,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						While Meleager’s thundering arm prevail’d:

					-
						Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast

						Althaea’s hate the unhappy warrior drew,

						His suppliant father, aged OEneus, came;

					-
						Thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,

						While life’s warm spirit beats within my breast.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 24: Verse 9

				-
					-
						No more molest me on Atrides’ part:

					-
						No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With fears distracted, with no fix’d design;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And all my people’s miseries are mine.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Now let us jointly to the trench descend,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						At every gate the fainting guard excite,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Else may the sudden foe our works invade,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						So near, and favour’d by the gloomy shade.”

						To him thus Nestor: “Trust the powers above,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor think proud Hector’s hopes confirm’d by Jove:
					-
				-

				-
					-
						How ill agree the views of vain mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-

						And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!

						Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain

						That great Achilles rise and rage again,

					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 7

						What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!

				-
					-
						Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The care is next our other chiefs to raise:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Some other be despatch’d of nimbler feet,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-

						To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With his great brother in his martial care:

				-
					-
						Him it behoved to every chief to sue,

					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 20

						Preventing every part perform’d by you;

						Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.”

					-
						To whom the king: “With reverence we allow

				-
					-
						Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:
					-

				-
					-
						My generous brother is of gentle kind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Content to follow when we lead the way:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But now, our ills industrious to prevent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The chiefs you named, already at his call,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Assembling there, between the trench and gates,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For great examples justify command.”
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With that, the venerable warrior rose;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His purple mantle golden buckles join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then rushing from his tent, he snatch’d in haste
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His steely lance, that lighten’d as he pass’d.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stopp’d at Ulysses’ tent, and call’d aloud.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						“What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?”
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						“O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Whatever means of safety can be sought,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,

				-
					-
						Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;

					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						All, all depend on this important night!”
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He heard, return’d, and took his painted shield;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then join’d the chiefs, and follow’d through the field.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His head reclining on his bossy shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A wood of spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						A bull’s black hide composed the hero’s bed;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						A splendid carpet roll’d beneath his head.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But sleep’st thou now, when from yon hill the foe
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Hangs o’er the fleet, and shades our walls below?”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.”
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But now the last despair surrounds our host;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Employ thy youth as I employ my age;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He serves me most, who serves his country best.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, the hero o’er his shoulders flung
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A lion’s spoils, that to his ankles hung;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, couching close, repel invading sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With toil protected from the prowling train;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Watch every side, and turn to every sound.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus watch’d the Grecians, cautious of surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Each step of passing feet increased the affright;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						“’Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Watch thus, and Greece shall live.” The hero said;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then o’er the trench the following chieftains led.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						His son, and godlike Merion, march’d behind
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						(For these the princes to their council join’d).
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The trenches pass’d, the assembled kings around
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						In silent state the consistory crown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The spot where Hector stopp’d his rage before;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When night descending, from his vengeful hand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And all his progress mark’d by heaps of dead:)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 33
				-
					-
						There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 14: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The council opening, in these words begun:
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His life to hazard, and his country save?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Lives there a man, who singly dares to go
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or favour’d by the night approach so near,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If to besiege our navies they prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						This could he learn, and to our peers recite,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What fame were his through all succeeding days,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What gifts his grateful country would bestow!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A sable ewe each leader should provide,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With each a sable lambkin by her side;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						At every rite his share should be increased,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And his the foremost honours of the feast.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Tydides spoke—“The man you seek is here.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Some god within commands, and I obey.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But let some other chosen warrior join,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To raise my hopes, and second my design.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						By mutual confidence and mutual aid,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And one brave hero fans another’s fire.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Contending leaders at the word arose;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each generous breast with emulation glows;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Bold Merion strove, and Nestor’s valiant heir;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The Spartan wish’d the second place to gain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And great Ulysses wish’d, nor wish’d in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then thus the king of men the contest ends:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						“Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In this great enterprise, is only thine.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Just be thy choice, without affection made;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To birth, or office, no respect be paid;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Let worth determine here.” The monarch spake,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And inly trembled for his brother’s sake.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin’d)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						My choice declares the impulse of my mind.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To lend his counsels and assist our hands?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A chief, whose safety is Minerva’s care;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Bless’d in his conduct, I no aid require;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Are lost on hearers that our merits know.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The reddening orient shows the coming day,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And of night’s empire but a third remains.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress’d.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Short of its crest, and with no plume o’erspread:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Soft wool within; without, in order spread,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A boar’s white teeth grinn’d horrid o’er his head.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Molus received, the pledge of social ties;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The helmet next by Merion was possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And now Ulysses’ thoughtful temples press’d.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And dark through paths oblique their progress take.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Just then, in sign she favour’d their intent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A long-wing’d heron great Minerva sent:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 25
				-
					-
						This, though surrounding shades obscured their view,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 26
				-
					-
						By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 27
				-
					-
						As from the right she soar’d, Ulysses pray’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 20: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Hail’d the glad omen, and address’d the maid:
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O thou! for ever present in my way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who all my motions, all my toils survey!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Safe by thy succour to our ships convey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And let some deed this signal night adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then godlike Diomed preferr’d his prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Daughter of Jove, unconquer’d Pallas! hear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						As thou defend’st the sire, defend the son.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When on Æsopus’ banks the banded powers
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He went a legate, but return’d a foe:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then help’d by thee, and cover’d by thy shield,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So now be present, O celestial maid!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So still continue to the race thine aid!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.”
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The heroes pray’d, and Pallas from the skies
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now, like two lions panting for the prey,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Through dust, through blood, o’er arms, and hills of slain.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On high designs the wakeful hours employ;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If now subdued they meditate their flight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His be the chariot that shall please him most,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of all the plunder of the vanquish’d host;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And his the glory to have served so well.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dolon his name, Eumedes’ only boy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not bless’d by nature with the charms of face,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						This high achievement, and explore the fleet:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And swear to grant me the demanded prize;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Even to the royal tent pursue my way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And all their counsels, all their aims betray.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And him alone the immortal steeds adorn.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus Hector swore: the gods were call’d in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Across his back the bended bow he flung,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A wolf’s grey hide around his shoulders hung,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A ferret’s downy fur his helmet lined,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then (never to return) he sought the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And trod the path his feet must tread no more.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Scarce had he pass’d the steeds and Trojan throng,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ulysses mark’d, and thus to Diomed;
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet let him pass, and win a little space;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But if too swift of foot he flies before,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Confine his course along the fleet and shore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And intercept his hoped return to Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that they stepp’d aside, and stoop’d their head,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(As Dolon pass’d,) behind a heap of dead:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Along the path the spy unwary flew;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So distant they, and such the space between,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						As when two teams of mules divide the green,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass’d;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Hector (he thought) had sent, and check’d his haste,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Till scarce at distance of a javelin’s throw,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And from the herd still turn the flying prey:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When brave Tydides stopp’d; a gen’rous thought
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then thus aloud: “Whoe’er thou art, remain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.”

						He said, and high in air the weapon cast,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Which wilful err’d, and o’er his shoulder pass’d;

						Then fix’d in earth. Against the trembling wood
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The wretch stood propp’d, and quiver’d as he stood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 31
				-
					-
						A sudden palsy seized his turning head;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His loose teeth chatter’d, and his colour fled;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The panting warriors seize him as he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 29: Verse 34

					-
						And with unmanly tears his life demands.

						Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:

						“Whoe’er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.

				-
					-
						To roam the silent fields in dead of night?
					-
				-

						Cam’st thou the secrets of our camp to find,

				-
					-
						By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 31: Verse 7

					-
						Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,

						“Hither I came, by Hector’s words deceived;

						Much did he promise, rashly I believed:

						No less a bribe than great Achilles’ car,

						And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,

						To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:

						Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,

						Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;

					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where’er he pass’d, a purple stream pursued
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And a low groan remurmur’d through the shore.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						So the grim lion, from his nightly den,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						O’erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 10

						Nor stopp’d the fury of his vengeful hand,

				-
					-
						The milk-white coursers studious to convey
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 18

					-
						Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 19

						Tydides’ falchion fix’d him to the ground.

				-
					-
						A warlike form appear’d before his tent,

					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 40: Verse 24

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 3

					-
						These, with his bow unbent, he lash’d along;

				-
					-
						(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus’ chariot hung;)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then gave his friend the signal to retire;

				-

				-
					-
						But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 7

					-
						Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To send more heroes to the infernal shade,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Drag off the car where Rhesus’ armour lay,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or heave with manly force, and lift away.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 41: Verse 12

				Book 10: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,

				-
					-
						Regard thy safety, and depart in peace;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The voice divine confess’d the martial maid;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In haste he mounted, and her word obey’d;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The coursers fly before Ulysses’ bow,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 43: Verse 4

				-
					-
						Had watch’d his Troy, and mark’d Minerva’s flight,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Saw Tydeus’ son with heavenly succour bless’d,
					-
				-

					-
						And vengeful anger fill’d his sacred breast.
					-

						And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;

				-
					-
						(On Rhesus’ side accustom’d to attend,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He rose, and saw the field deform’d with blood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 10
				-
					-
						An empty space where late the coursers stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now while on Rhesus’ name he calls in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The gathering tumult spreads o’er all the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 15
				-
					-
						On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 44: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And wondering view the slaughters of the night.

				Book 10: Stanza 45

				-
					-
						Where late the spoils of Hector’s spy were laid,
					-

						Ulysses stopp’d; to him Tydides bore
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-

						The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon’s gore:

						Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 45: Verse 6

						Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Return’d triumphant with this prize of war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The chiefs outnumber’d by the Trojan train;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.”
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 47

						Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,

						With words of friendship and extended hands

			-
				-

				-
					-
						“Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,

						Thou living glory of the Grecian name!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The spoil of foes, or present of a god?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,

						That draw the burning chariot of the day.

						Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.
					-
				-

						Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,

					-
						Bless’d as ye are, and favourites of the skies;

						The care of him who bids the thunder roar,

						Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.

				-
					-
						Discord with joy the scene of death descries,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Discord alone, of all the immortal train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						But general murmurs told their griefs above,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And each accused the partial will of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-

						Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And fix’d, fulfill’d the just decrees of fate.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						On earth he turn’d his all-considering eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And mark’d the spot where Ilion’s towers arise;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-

						The victor’s rage, the dying, and the dead.

						O’er heaven’s pure azure spread the glowing light,

						But not till half the prostrate forests lay

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 10

						Then, nor till then, the Greeks’ impulsive might
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 12

						Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.

						Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And slew Bienor at his people’s head:

					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Whose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Leap’d from the chariot to revenge his king;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But in his front he felt the fatal wound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Which pierced his brain, and stretch’d him on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Atrides spoil’d, and left them on the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Now soil’d with dust, and naked to the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 22

						Two sons of Priam next to battle move,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The product, one of marriage, one of love:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In the same car the brother-warriors ride;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						This took the charge to combat, that to guide:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Far other task, than when they wont to keep,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On Ida’s tops, their father’s fleecy sheep.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						These on the mountains once Achilles found,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then to their sire for ample sums restored;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But now to perish by Atrides’ sword:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Cleft through the head his brother’s fate succeeds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The Trojans see the youths untimely die,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So when a lion ranging o’er the lawns,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						All drown’d in sweat, the panting mother flies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Amidst the tumult of the routed train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The sons of false Antimachus were slain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And voted Helen’s stay for Paris’ gold.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Atrides mark’d, as these their safety sought,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And slew the children for the father’s fault;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						They shook with fear, and dropp’d the silken rein;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These words, attended with the flood of tears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The youths address’d to unrelenting ears:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The daring wretch who once in council stood
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To shed Ulysses’ and my brother’s blood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For proffer’d peace! and sues his seed for grace?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, Pisander from the car he cast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His brother leap’d to earth; but, as he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The trenchant falchion lopp’d his hands away;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His sever’d head was toss’d among the throng,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The king’s example all his Greeks pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The distanced army wonders at his deeds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As when the winds with raging flames conspire,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And o’er the forests roll the flood of fire,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						In blazing heaps the grove’s old honours fall,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And one refulgent ruin levels all:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Before Atrides’ rage so sinks the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And many a car, now lighted of its lord,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the field with guideless fury rolls,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						While his keen falchion drinks the warriors’ lives;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But Jove and destiny prolong’d his date.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through the mid field the routed urge their way:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The path they take, and speed to reach the town.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The hero halts, and his associates waits.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Meanwhile on every side around the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dispersed, disorder’d, fly the Trojan train.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay’d
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The lion’s roaring through the midnight shade;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						On heaps they tumble with successless haste;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Still press’d the rout, and still the hindmost slew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Hurl’d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To godlike Hector this our word convey—
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And trust the war to less important hands:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Till to the main the burning sun descend,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And sacred night her awful shade extend.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and Iris at his word obey’d;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On wings of winds descends the various maid.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The goddess then: “O son of Priam, hear!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.
					-
				-

					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said, and vanish’d. Hector, with a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The fight renew’d with fiercer fury burns:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 18: Verse 12

						Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,

					-
						Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And early honour warm his generous breast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When the kind sire consign’d his daughter’s charms
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(Theano’s sister) to his youthful arms.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But call’d by glory to the wars of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And swift to aid his dearer country flies.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With twelve black ships he reach’d Percope’s strand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Thence took the long laborious march by land.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Atrides first discharged the missive spear;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The Trojan stoop’d, the javelin pass’d in air.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then near the corslet, at the monarch’s heart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The point rebated, and repell’d the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Encumber’d with the dart, Atrides stands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Till, grasp’d with force, he wrench’d it from his hands;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						At once his weighty sword discharged a wound
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Full on his neck, that fell’d him to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Stretch’d in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Thy country’s friend; and virtuous, though in vain!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 33
				-
					-
						No more the youth shall join his consort’s side,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 34
				-
					-
						At once a virgin, and at once a bride!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 35
				-
					-
						No more with presents her embraces meet,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 37
				-
					-
						On whom his passion, lavish of his store,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Bestow’d so much, and vainly promised more!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Unwept, uncover’d, on the plain he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 19: Verse 40
				-
					-
						While the proud victor bore his arms away.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Coon, Antenor’s eldest hope, was nigh:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the pale features now deform’d with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Aim’d at the king, and near his elbow strook.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His brother’s corpse the pious Trojan draws,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And calls his country to assert his cause;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And o’er the body spreads his ample shield.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Atrides, marking an unguarded part,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Transfix’d the warrior with his brazen dart;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Prone on his brother’s bleeding breast he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The monarch’s falchion lopp’d his head away:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The social shades the same dark journey go,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And join each other in the realms below.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The vengeful victor rages round the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With every weapon art or fury yields:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o’erthrown.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This, while yet warm distill’d the purple flood;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(The powers that cause the teeming matron’s throes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then with a voice which fury made more strong,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And envies half the glories of the day.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And from their sides the foam descends in snow;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Shot through the battle in a moment’s space,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The wounded monarch at his tent they place.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						No sooner Hector saw the king retired,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Your great forefathers’ virtues, and your own.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With words like these the fiery chief alarms
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His fainting host, and every bosom warms.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On the black body of the foe he pours;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						As from the cloud’s deep bosom, swell’d with showers,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan’s glory crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Opites next was added to their side;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Dispels the gather’d clouds that Notus forms:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The gust continued, violent and strong,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						O’erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Now the last ruin the whole host appals;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 31
				-
					-
						But wise Ulysses call’d Tydides forth,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 33
				-
					-
						“And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Till Hector’s arm involve the ships in flame?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Haste, let us join, and combat side by side.”
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 25: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He sigh’d; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His death ennobled by Ulysses’ sword.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There slain, they left them in eternal night,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Stern Hector’s conquests in the middle plain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stood check’d awhile, and Greece respired again.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Towering they rode in one refulgent car:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In deep prophetic arts their father skill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Had warn’d his children from the Trojan field.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fate urged them on: the father warn’d in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						They rush’d to fight, and perish’d on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,

						And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						By Tydeus’ lance Agastrophus was slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wing’d with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He fled, but flying left his life behind.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 19
				-
					-
						This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Shouts, as he pass’d, the crystal regions rend,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And moving armies on his march attend.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 28: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And thus bespoke his brother of the war:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here stand his utmost force.”—The warrior said;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor miss’d its aim, but where the plumage danced
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus’ hands)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But yet so stunn’d, that, staggering on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O’er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Tydides followed to regain his lance;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						While Hector rose, recover’d from the trance,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And oft that partial power has lent his aid.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 22
				-
					-
						If any god assist Tydides’ hand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 29: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,”
					-

					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Him, while he triumph’d, Paris eyed from far,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Around the fields his feather’d shafts he sent,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From ancient Ilus’ ruin’d monument:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And wing’d an arrow at the unwary foe;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Just as he stoop’d, Agastrophus’s crest
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The bowstring twang’d; nor flew the shaft in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But pierced his foot, and nail’d it to the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Would the same god had fix’d it in his heart!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						As scatter’d lambs the rushing lion fear.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He dauntless thus: “Thou conqueror of the fair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unskill’d in arms to act a manly part!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thou hast but done what boys or women can;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A coward’s weapon never hurts the brave.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not so this dart, which thou may’st one day feel;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Where this but lights, some noble life expires;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And leaves such objects as distract the fair.”
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 32: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But stands collected in himself, and whole,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And questions thus his own unconquer’d soul:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What danger, singly if I stand the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						My friends all scatter’d, all the foes around?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To die or conquer, proves a hero’s heart;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And, knowing this, I know a soldier’s part.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press’d;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And round him deep the steely circle grows.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						By these, by those, on every part is plied;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the red slaughter spreads on every side.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Ulysses reach’d him with the fatal spear;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But to his aid his brother Socus flies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 35: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Not deeper skill’d in every martial sleight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And end at once the great Hippasian race,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or thou beneath this lance must press the field.”
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Plough’d half his side, and bared it to the bone.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By Pallas’ care, the spear, though deep infix’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Stopp’d short of life, nor with his entrails mix’d.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fate calls thee hence and finish’d is thy race.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And add one spectre to the realms below!”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Trembling gave way, and turn’d his back to flight;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And held its passage through the panting heart:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Wide in his breast appear’d the grisly wound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He falls; his armour rings against the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						“Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There ends thy narrow span assign’d by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And hovering vultures scream around their prey.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then raging with intolerable smart,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And gladden’d Troy with sight of hostile blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Alarm’d, to Ajax Telamon he cried,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who shares his labours, and defends his side:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“O friend! Ulysses’ shouts invade my ear;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Oppress’d by multitudes, the best may fall.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Greece robb’d of him must bid her host despair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 39: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And feel a loss not ages can repair.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The prudent chief in sore distress they found,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With bands of furious Trojans compass’d round.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Till life’s warm vapour issuing through the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The lion rushes through the woodland shade,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The lordly savage vindicates his prey.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ulysses thus, unconquer’d by his pains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A single warrior half a host sustains:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The scattered crowds fly frighted o’er the field;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Atrides’ arm the sinking hero stays,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 40: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And first Doryclus, Priam’s son, he slew,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when a torrent, swell’d with wintry rains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pours from the mountains o’er the deluged plains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A country’s ruins! to the seas are borne:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fierce Ajax thus o’erwhelms the yielding throng;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The warrior’s fury; there the battle glows;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There fierce on foot, or from the chariot’s height,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And trembling Greece for her physician fear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						“Glory of Greece, old Neleus’ valiant son!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And great Machaon to the ships convey;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A wise physician skill’d our wounds to heal,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Is more than armies to the public weal.”
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The wounded offspring of the healing god.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 42: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But now Cebriones, from Hector’s car,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Survey’d the various fortune of the war:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before great Ajax see the mingled throng
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I know him well, distinguish’d o’er the field
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having spoke, the driver’s lash resounds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O’er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The horses’ hoofs are bathed in heroes’ gore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, dashing, purple all the car before;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The groaning axle sable drops distils,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The ranks he scatter’d and the troops o’erthrown:)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But partial Jove, espousing Hector’s part,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian’s heart;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Confused, unnerved in Hector’s presence grown,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 19
				-
					-
						O’er his broad back his moony shield he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 27
				-
					-
						So turn’d stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 44: Verse 28
				-
					-
						While his swoln heart at every step rebell’d.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The patient animal maintains his ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And threats his followers with retorted eye.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fix’d as the bar between two warring powers,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 16
				-
					-
						While hissing darts descend in iron showers:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Whose eager javelin launch’d against the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 25
				-
					-
						From his torn liver the red current flow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And his slack knees desert their dying load.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The victor rushing to despoil the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 28
				-
					-
						From Paris’ bow a vengeful arrow fled;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Fix’d in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Fix’d was the point, but broken was the wood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 45: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay’d?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Oh, turn to arms; ’tis Ajax claims your aid.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And this the last brave battle he shall wage:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The warrior rescue, and your country save.”
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Each takes new courage at the hero’s sight;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The hero rallies, and renews the fight.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						While Nestor’s chariot far from fight retires:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His coursers steep’d in sweat, and stain’d with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Greeks’ preserver, great Machaon, bore.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That hour Achilles, from the topmost height
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of his proud fleet, o’erlook’d the fields of fight;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His feasted eyes beheld around the plain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His friend Machaon singled from the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A transient pity touch’d his vengeful breast.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Straight to Menoetius’ much-loved son he sent:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And fix’d the date of all his woes to come.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whate’er thy will, Patroclus shall obey.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Still at my heart, and ever at my side!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The time is come, when yon despairing host
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shall learn the value of the man they lost:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His form recall’d Machaon to my mind;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 49: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The coursers pass’d me with so swift a pace.”
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The hero said. His friend obey’d with haste,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through intermingled ships and tents he pass’d;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The chiefs descending from their car he found:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The warriors standing on the breezy shore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Convey’d that freshness the cool seas exhale;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then to consult on farther methods went,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And took their seats beneath the shady tent.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Arsinous’ daughter, graced with golden hairs:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Greece, as the prize of Nestor’s wisdom gave:)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A table first with azure feet she placed;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Honey new-press’d, the sacred flour of wheat,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And wholesome garlic, crown’d the savoury treat,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,

						A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 21
				-
					-
						From eldest times: emboss’d with studs of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Two feet support it, and four handles hold;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 23
				-
					-
						On each bright handle, bending o’er the brink,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 24
				-
					-
						In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 25
				-
					-
						A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 26
				-
					-
						When the brisk nectar overlook’d the brim.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Temper’d in this, the nymph of form divine
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With goat’s-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And last with flour the smiling surface strows:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 31
				-
					-
						This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Salubrious draughts the warriors’ thirst allay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 50: Verse 34

						And pleasing conference beguiles the day.

						Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 51: Verse 4

						“’Tis now no season for these kind delays;

						The great Achilles with impatience stays.

						To great Achilles this respect I owe;

				-
					-
						Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 6

					-
						With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 7

						Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,

						Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,

						Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,

						And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.

					-
						But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 18

					-
						Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Now the slow course of all-impairing time
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 26
				-
					-
						When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And stretch’d the great Itymonaeus dead!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And ours was all the plunder of the plains:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 32
				-
					-
						As many goats, as many lowing kine:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And thrice the number of unrivall’d steeds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 34
				-
					-
						All teeming females, and of generous breeds.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 35
				-
					-
						These, as my first essay of arms, I won;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 40
				-
					-
						When the proud Elians first commenced the war:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 41
				-
					-
						For Neleus’ sons Alcides’ rage had slain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Oppress’d, we arm’d; and now this conquest gain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 44
				-
					-
						My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 45
				-
					-
						(That large reprisal he might justly claim,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 46
				-
					-
						For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 47
				-
					-
						When Elis’ monarch, at the public course,

				-
					-
						The just partition, and due victims paid.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 52
				-
					-
						With many a courser, and with many a car;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The sons of Actor at their army’s head
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 54
				-
					-
						(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The stream they pass’d, and pitch’d their tents below.

					-
						Pallas, descending in the shades of night,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Fear’d for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And stopp’d my chariot, and detain’d my arms.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 52: Verse 65
				-
					-
						My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled
					-
				-

						Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.

						There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,

						Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;

				-
					-
						When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I, and Ulysses, touch’d at Phthia’s port,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 8

						And entered Peleus’ hospitable court.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 10

					-
						And pour’d libations on the flaming thighs.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 12

					-
						Menoetius, turn’d the fragments on the fire.

						Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;

					-
						Social we sit, and share the genial rites.

						We then explained the cause on which we came,

					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Peleus said only this:—‘My son! be brave.’
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Menoetius thus: ‘Though great Achilles shine
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In strength superior, and of race divine,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 21

					-
						Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;

					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.’
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Thus spoke your father at Thessalia’s court:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Words now forgot, though now of vast import.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Some favouring god Achilles’ heart may move;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 29
				-
					-
						If some dire oracle his breast alarm,

					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 30
				-
					-
						If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 31

						Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,

					-
						Clad in Achilles’ arms, if thou appear,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 54: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Press’d by fresh forces, her o’er-labour’d train

					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This touch’d his generous heart, and from the tent

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Along the shore with hasty strides he went;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 55: Verse 4

					-
						Large painful drops from all his members run;

				-

						As faintly reeling he confess’d the smart,

				-
					-
						Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.

						Divine compassion touch’d Patroclus’ breast,

						Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address’d:

			-
				Book 11: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Far from your friends, and from your native shore?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Resists she yet the raging Hector’s hand?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or are her heroes doom’d to die with shame,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 56: Verse 8

						And this the period of our wars and fame?”
					-
			-

						Eurypylus replies: “No more, my friend;

					-
						Greece is no more! this day her glories end;
					-

						Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,

						Her force increasing as her toil renews.

						Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,

						Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.

						But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,

						Lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 57: Verse 9

						With lukewarm water wash the gore away;

						With healing balms the raging smart allay,

						Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,

						Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.

						Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands

						This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;

					-
						And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,
					-

					Book 11: Stanza 57: Verse 16

						To him the chief: “What then remains to do?

					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The event of things the gods alone can view.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 3

						Charged by Achilles’ great command I fly,

						But thy distress this instant claims relief.”

						The slaves their master’s slow approach survey’d,

					-
						And hides of oxen on the floor display’d:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There stretch’d at length the wounded hero lay;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Patroclus cut the forky steel away:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The wound he wash’d, the styptic juice infused.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 58: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,

						The proudest monument of mortal hands!

				-
					-
						Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 8

						Then Ida’s summits pour’d their watery store;

						And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main

						Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:

						These, turn’d by Phoebus from their wonted ways,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Deluged the rampire nine continual days;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 18

						And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.

					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 19

						Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,

						The god of ocean, marching stern before,

						In their old bounds the rivers roll again,

						But this the gods in later times perform;

					-
						As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 4

						War thunder’d at the gates, and blood distain’d the towers.

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 5

					-
						Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hector’s approach in every wind they hear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Hector’s fury every moment fear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He, like a whirlwind, toss’d the scattering throng,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So ’midst the dogs and hunters’ daring bands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Arm’d foes around a dreadful circle form,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And where he turns the rout disperse or die:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With equal rage encompass’d Hector glows;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Eager they view’d the prospect dark and deep,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And bristled thick with sharpen’d stakes below.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The foot alone this strong defence could force,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And try the pass impervious to the horse.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Restrain’d great Hector, and this counsel gave:
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						On certain dangers we too rashly run:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If ’tis his will our haughty foes to tame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And one great day destroy and bury all!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But should they turn, and here oppress our train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In one promiscuous carnage crush’d and bruised,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 24

						And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 5
			-

					-
						Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 3

						By orders strict the charioteers enjoin’d

						The sons of Priam with the third appear,

						Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The gates half-open’d to receive the last.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His following host with clamours rend the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who from the Lapiths’ warlike race descend;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This Polypoetes, great Perithous’ heir,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And that Leonteus, like the god of war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						High on the hills appears their stately form,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So graceful these, and so the shock they stand
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of raging Asius, and his furious band.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In vain around them beat their hollow shields;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To guard their navies, and defend the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Even when they saw Troy’s sable troops impend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Forth from the portals rush’d the intrepid pair,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So two wild boars spring furious from their den,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						On every side the crackling trees they tear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Maintain’d the walls, and mann’d the lofty towers:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						To save their fleet their last efforts they try,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The dreary winter on his frozen wings;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Descend, and whiten all the fields below:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So fast the darts on either army pour,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Heavy, and thick, resound the batter’d shields,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“In powers immortal who shall now believe?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What man could doubt but Troy’s victorious power
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To guard the entrance of their common hive,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A race determined, that to death contend:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Repel an army, and defraud the fates?”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These empty accents mingled with the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor moved great Jove’s unalterable mind;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To godlike Hector and his matchless might
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Was owed the glory of the destined fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And all the gates sustain’d an equal tide;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The spirit of a god my breast inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						While Greece unconquer’d kept alive the war,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Secure of death, confiding in despair;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With unassisting arms deplored the day.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						First Damasus, by Polypoetes’ steel,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pierced through his helmet’s brazen visor, fell;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And round him rose a monument of dead.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						By Heaven alarm’d, by prodigies amazed:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A signal omen stopp’d the passing host,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Their martial fury in their wonder lost.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Jove’s bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A bleeding serpent of enormous size,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His talons truss’d; alive, and curling round,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						In airy circles wings his painful way,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 31
				-
					-
						They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And Jove’s portent with beating hearts behold.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Then first Polydamas the silence broke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Long weigh’d the signal, and to Hector spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						True to those counsels which I judge the best,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To speak his thoughts is every freeman’s right,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And all I move, deferring to thy sway,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But tends to raise that power which I obey.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thus my mind explains its clear event:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The victor eagle, whose sinister flight
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Dismiss’d his conquest in the middle skies,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Allow’d to seize, but not possess the prize;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 20
				-
					-
						More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 21
				-
					-
						So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 13: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him then Hector with disdain return’d:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn’d:)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What coward counsels would thy madness move
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Against the word, the will reveal’d of Jove?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And happy thunders of the favouring god,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						By wandering birds that flit with every wind?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or where the suns arise, or where descend;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To right, to left, unheeded take your way,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						While I the dictates of high heaven obey.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And asks no omen but his country’s cause.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But why should’st thou suspect the war’s success?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						None fears it more, as none promotes it less:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Troy and her sons may find a general grave,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Spread their cold poison through our soldiers’ breasts,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						My javelin can revenge so base a part,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And free the soul that quivers in thy heart.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Calls on his host; his host obey the call;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With ardour follow where their leader flies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And gives great Hector the predestined day.

						Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,

					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						While these they undermine, and those they rend;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The generous impulse every Greek obeys;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 22

						Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.

						“Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,

					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Since not alike endued with force or art;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Behold a day when each may act his part!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To gain new glories, or augment the old.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 7

						Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Drown Hector’s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So Jove once more may drive their routed train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-

						And Troy lie trembling in her walls again.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And now the stones descend in heavier showers.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In winter’s bleak uncomfortable reign,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A snowy inundation hides the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And first the mountain-tops are cover’d o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And one bright waste hides all the works of men:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The circling seas, alone absorbing all,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So from each side increased the stony rain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And the white ruin rises o’er the plain.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till great Sarpedon tower’d amid the field;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bears aloft his ample shield in air;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So press’d with hunger, from the mountain’s brow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Descends a lion on the flocks below;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So stalks the lordly savage o’er the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And shepherds gall him with an iron war;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With generous rage that drives him on the foes.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He views the towers, and meditates their fall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then casting on his friend an ardent look,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where Xanthus’ streams enrich the Lycian plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Our feasts enhanced with music’s sprightly sound?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Why on those shores are we with joy survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Admired as heroes, and as gods obey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Unless great acts superior merit prove,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And vindicate the bounteous powers above?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						’Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The first in valour, as the first in place;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That when with wondering eyes our martial bands
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Behold our deeds transcending our commands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Whom those that envy dare not imitate!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						For lust of fame I should not vainly dare
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But since, alas! ignoble age must come,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Disease, and death’s inexorable doom,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The life, which others pay, let us bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-

						And give to fame what we to nature owe;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 21: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Brave though we fall, and honour’d if we live,
					-
				-

						He said; his words the listening chief inspire

					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior’s fire;

				-

				-
					-
						The troops pursue their leaders with delight,

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 4

						Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.

						Menestheus from on high the storm beheld

				-
					-
						Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Around the walls he gazed, to view from far
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What aid appear’d to avert the approaching war,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then thus to Thoos: “Hence with speed (he said),
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Their strength, united, best may help to bear

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-

						The bloody labours of the doubtful war:

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The best and bravest of the hostile force.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But if too fiercely there the foes contend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						To share the danger, and repel the foe.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!

					-
						Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus’ son demands;

					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Straight to the fort great Ajax turn’d his care,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To you I trust the fortune of the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Till by this arm the foe shall be repell’d:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						That done, expect me to complete the day.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.”
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With equal steps bold Teucer press’d the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						High on the walls appear’d the Lycian powers,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Greeks, oppress’d, their utmost force unite,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The war renews, mix’d shouts and groans arise;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Sarpedon’s friend. Across the warrior’s way,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In modern ages not the strongest swain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He poised, and swung it round; then toss’d on high,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						It flew with force, and labour’d up the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Full on the Lycian’s helmet thundering down,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The ponderous ruin crush’d his batter’d crown.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As skilful divers from some airy steep
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From Teucer’s hand a winged arrow flew;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The bearded shaft the destined passage found,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The chief, who fear’d some foe’s insulting boast
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Might stop the progress of his warlike host,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Conceal’d the wound, and, leaping from his height
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 8

						Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld

						Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His beating breast with generous ardour glows,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Alcmaon first was doom’d his force to feel;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then from the yawning wound with fury tore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His brazen armour rings against the ground.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 27
			-

					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift to the battlement the victor flies,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The rolling ruins smoke along the field.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fix’d in his belt the feather’d weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But Jove was present in the dire debate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The prince gave back, not meditating flight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But urging vengeance, and severer fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then raised with hope, and fired with glory’s charms,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The breach lies open, but your chief in vain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 27: Verse 22

					-
						The force of powerful union conquers all.”
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fix’d support the weight of all the war;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As on the confines of adjoining grounds,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						One foot, one inch, of the contended field;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The copious slaughter covers all the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And the high ramparts drip with human gore.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From side to side the trembling balance nods,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(While some laborious matron, just and poor,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So stood the war, till Hector’s matchless might,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With fates prevailing, turn’d the scale of fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And fires his host with loud repeated cries.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,
					-
				-

					-
						Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!”
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Around the works a wood of glittering spears
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Such men as live in these degenerate days:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The snowy fleece, he toss’d, and shook in air;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For Jove upheld, and lighten’d of its load
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thus arm’d, before the folded gates he came,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 27
				-
					-
						With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 28
				-
					-
						On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The folds are shatter’d; from the crackling door
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 35
				-
					-
						A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And from his eye-balls flash’d the living flame.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 37
				-
					-
						He moves a god, resistless in his course,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And seems a match for more than mortal force.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then pouring after, through the gaping space,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 40
				-
					-
						A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 29: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The shore is heap’d with death, and tumult rends the sky.

						And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,

						Renown’d for justice and for length of days;

					-
						Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,

					-
						From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:

						Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene

						No aid, he deems, to either host is given,

					-
						Where Ida’s misty tops confusedly rise;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 2: Verse 7

						At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,

						Fierce as he pass’d, the lofty mountains nod,

						Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:

						Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Greece yet may live, her threaten’d fleet maintain:

						And Hector’s force, and Jove’s own aid, be vain.”

						Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He touch’d the chiefs, and steel’d their manly souls:

				-
					-
						Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,

				-

						Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 7: Verse 7

					-
						Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,

						Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:

						Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;

						Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;

					-
						Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:

						I mark’d his parting, and the steps he trod;

				-
					-
						Before his wary steps his ample shield.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 5

						Bold Merion aim’d a stroke (nor aim’d it wide);
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The Trojan warrior, touch’d with timely fear,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The Greek, retreating, mourn’d his frustrate blow,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then to the ships with surly speed he went,
					-
				-

						The youth had dwelt, remote from war’s alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And blest in bright Medesicaste’s arms:

				-
					-
						(This nymph, the fruit of Priam’s ravish’d joy,

						Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To Troy, when glory call’d his arms, he came,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And match’d the bravest of her chiefs in fame:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With Priam’s sons, a guardian of the throne,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-

						He lived, beloved and honour’d as his own.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He groans beneath the Telamonian spear.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As from some far-seen mountain’s airy crown,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						From Hector’s hand a shining javelin fled:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						He saw, and shunn’d the death; the forceful dart
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus’s heart,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 25

						Cteatus’ son, of Neptune’s forceful line;

						Vain was his courage, and his race divine!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 29
				-
					-
						To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 31
				-
					-
						When Ajax’ manly arm a javelin flung;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Full on the shield’s round boss the weapon rung;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 33
				-
					-
						He felt the shock, nor more was doom’d to feel,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Secure in mail, and sheath’d in shining steel.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Between the leaders of the Athenian line,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 38
				-
					-
						(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces’ prize.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 41
				-
					-
						As two grim lions bear across the lawn,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Snatch’d from devouring hounds, a slaughter’d fawn.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 43
				-
					-
						In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 45
				-
					-
						So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Strips his bright arms; Oileus lops his head:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Toss’d like a ball, and whirl’d in air away,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 17: Verse 48
				-
					-
						At Hector’s feet the gory visage lay.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His pensive brow the generous care express’d
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With which a wounded soldier touch’d his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And his sad comrades from the battle bore;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						That office paid, he issued from his tent
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In Thoas’ voice, Andraemon’s valiant son,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Who ruled where Calydon’s white rocks arise,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Pleuron’s chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Where’s now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 19: Verse 2

						Of Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom the king: “On Greece no blame be thrown;

				-
					-
						Arms are her trade, and war is all her own.

					Book 13: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:
					-
				-

					-
						’Tis heaven, alas! and Jove’s all-powerful doom,

						That far, far distant from our native home

						Wills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!

						Or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,

						And what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 1

						Thus he: and thus the god whose force can make

						The solid globe’s eternal basis shake:

						“Ah! never may he see his native land,

						But feed the vultures on this hateful strand,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor dares to combat on this signal day!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 21: Verse 9

						Together let us battle on the plain;

						Two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:

						This said, he rushes where the combat burns;

					-
						Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:

				-
					-
						From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And clad in arms that lighten’d all the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,

						What holds thy courage from so brave a field?
					-
				-

					-
						This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;

				-
					-
						The wonted weapons; those my tent can give;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 25: Verse 3

					-
						Spears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)

						That shed a lustre round the illumined wall,

						Though I, disdainful of the distant war,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,
					-
				-

						Have proved thy valour, and unconquer’d might:

				-
					-
						And were some ambush for the foes design’d,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Even there thy courage would not lag behind:

				-
					-
						In that sharp service, singled from the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The fear of each, or valour, stands confess’d.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;

					-
						He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:

				-
					-
						A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 10

					-
						Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;

				-
					-
						Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 13

					-
						And looks a bloodless image of despair!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 14

						Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:

				-
					-
						Composed his thought, determined is his eye,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 27: Verse 17

						And fix’d his soul, to conquer or to die:

				-
					-
						If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,

						Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?
					-
				-

			-
				Book 13: Stanza 29
			-

						And, breathing slaughter, follow’d to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 29: Verse 3

				-
					-
						The pride of haughty warriors to confound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From Thrace they fly, call’d to the dire alarms
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,

					-
						To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.

			-
				Book 13: Stanza 30
			-

						Or combat in the centre of the fight?

					-
						Great must he be, of more than human birth,

				-
					-
						Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In standing fight he mates Achilles’ force,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Excell’d alone in swiftness in the course.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 17

					-
						Then to the left our ready arms apply,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 18

						He said: and Merion to th’ appointed place,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-

						Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rush like a fiery torrent o’er the field,

				-
					-
						Their force embodied in a tide they pour;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The rising combat sounds along the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-

						As warring winds, in Sirius’ sultry reign,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 8

						From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 9

					-
						On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 10

					-
						And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken’d heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						All dreadful glared the iron face of war,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Bristled with upright spears, that flash’d afar;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And polish’d arms emblazed the flaming fields:
					-

						Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,

				-

						Warr’d on the king of heaven with stern disdain,

				-

						Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bold Idomeneus controls the day.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swell’d with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Call’d by the voice of war to martial fame,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From high Cabesus’ distant walls he came;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Cassandra’s love he sought, with boasts of power,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And promised conquest was the proffer’d dower.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The king consented, by his vaunts abused;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The king consented, but the fates refused.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The field he measured with a larger stride.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Him as he stalk’d, the Cretan javelin found;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His arms resounded as the boaster fell.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						“And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And such the contract of the Phrygian king!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Our offers now, illustrious prince! receive;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 22
				-
					-
						For such an aid what will not Argos give?
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 23
				-
					-
						To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And count Atrides’ fairest daughter thine.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Meantime, on further methods to advise,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 27
				-
					-
						There hear what Greece has on her part to say.”
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 28
				-
					-
						He spoke, and dragg’d the gory corse away.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 29
				-
					-
						This Asius view’d, unable to contain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Before his chariot warring on the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 31
				-
					-
						(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Impatient panted on his neck behind:)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 33
				-
					-
						To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 34
				-
					-
						He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And glitter’d, extant at the further side.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 39
				-
					-
						As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Then spreads a length of ruin o’er the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 43
				-
					-
						So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And stretch’d before his much-loved coursers lay.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 45
				-
					-
						He grinds the dust distain’d with streaming gore,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 50
				-
					-
						But falls transfix’d, an unresisting prey:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The stately car, and labours out his breath.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Thus Asius’ steeds (their mighty master gone)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Remain the prize of Nestor’s youthful son.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stabb’d at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From his slope shield the disappointed lance.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On his raised arm by two strong braces stay’d,)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He lay collected in defensive shade.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						O’er his safe head the javelin idly sung,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor’s breast:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Warm’d in his liver, to the ground it bore
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The chief, his people’s guardian now no more!
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For thee, through hell’s black portals stand display’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Touch’d every Greek, but Nestor’s son the most.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And his broad buckler shields his slaughter’d friend:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His honour’d body to the tented shore.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Resolved to perish in his country’s cause,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To wail his fate in death’s eternal gloom.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Great Æsyetes was the hero’s sire;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Anchises’ eldest hope, and darling care:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 9

					-
						Who charm’d her parents’ and her husband’s heart
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With beauty, sense, and every work of art:
					-
				-

				-
					-
						He once of Ilion’s youth the loveliest boy,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fairest she of all the fair of Troy.
					-
				-

						By Neptune now the hapless hero dies,

					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fix’d as some column, or deep-rooted oak,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 20

						Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.

						The riven armour sends a jarring sound;

				-
					-
						His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 38: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Life’s purple tide impetuous gush’d away.
					-
			-

						Then Idomen, insulting o’er the slain:

					Book 13: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:

						Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O’er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thence my ships transport me through the main:

				-
					-
						Lord of a host, o’er all my host I shine,

				-

					-
						To him, ambitious of so great an aid,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 40: Verse 10

					Book 13: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Beneath his cares thy early youth was train’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						One table fed you, and one roof contain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Haste, and revenge it on th’ insulting foe.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Æneas heard, and for a space resign’d
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To tender pity all his manly mind;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Greek awaits him with collected might.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As the fell boar, on some rough mountain’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Arm’d with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Attends the tumult, and expects the war;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						O’er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And met the Trojan with a lowering look.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The youthful offspring of the god of war,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown’d:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To these the warrior sent his voice around.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 19
				-
					-
						“Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 42: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The great dispute, of glory, or of life.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey’d;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Around the chief. Æneas too demands
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Th’ assisting forces of his native bands;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In order follow all th’ embodied train,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Like Ida’s flocks proceeding o’er the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So joys Æneas, as his native band
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 43: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Moves on in rank, and stretches o’er the land.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On every side the steely circle grows;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now batter’d breast-plates and hack’d helmets ring,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And o’er their heads unheeded javelins sing.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And burn’d to drench the ground with mutual blood.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The Trojan weapon whizz’d along in air;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Cretan saw, and shunn’d the brazen spear:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Stuck deep in earth, and quiver’d where it stood.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But OEnomas received the Cretan’s stroke;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 15
				-
					-
						It ripp’d his belly with a ghastly wound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And roll’d the smoking entrails on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Stretch’d on the plain, he sobs away his breath,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The victor from his breast the weapon tears;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Though now unfit an active war to wage,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 23
				-
					-
						His listless limbs unable for the course,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 24
				-
					-
						In standing fight he yet maintains his force;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Till faint with labour, and by foes repell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Deiphobus beheld him as he pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The javelin err’d, but held its course along,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 44: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And gnash’d the dust, all bloody with his wound.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor knew the furious father of his fall;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On golden clouds th’ immortal synod sate;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Detain’d from bloody war by Jove and Fate.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And from his temples rends the glittering prize;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The hollow helmet rings against the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From his torn arm the Grecian rent away
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The reeking javelin, and rejoin’d his friends.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His wounded brother good Polites tends;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Around his waist his pious arms he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And from the rage of battle gently drew:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 46: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And sprinkling, as he pass’d, the sands with gore.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Bold Aphareus by great Æneas bled;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						As toward the chief he turn’d his daring head,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress’d
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His shield reversed o’er the fallen warrior lies,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Antilochus, as Thoon turn’d him round,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The hollow vein, that to the neck extends
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Supine he falls, and to his social train
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 16
				-
					-
						From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His time observed; for closed by foes around,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 18
				-
					-
						On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His shield emboss’d the ringing storm sustains,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But he impervious and untouch’d remains.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(Great Neptune’s care preserved from hostile rage
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 22
				-
					-
						This youth, the joy of Nestor’s glorious age.)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 23
				-
					-
						In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Faced every foe, and every danger sought;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His winged lance, resistless as the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Obeys each motion of the master’s mind!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Restless it flies, impatient to be free,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And meditates the distant enemy.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And struck his target with the brazen spear
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And blunts the javelin of th’ eluded foe:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 33
				-
					-
						In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Splinter’d on earth flew half the broken wood.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Disarm’d, he mingled in the Trojan crew;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 36
				-
					-
						But Merion’s spear o’ertook him as he flew,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Deep in the belly’s rim an entrance found,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 41
				-
					-
						While death’s strong pangs distend his labouring side,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 42
				-
					-
						His bulk enormous on the field displays;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 43
				-
					-
						His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The spear the conqueror from his body drew,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And death’s dim shadows swarm before his view.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 47
				-
					-
						King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And smote his temples with an arm so strong,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The helm fell off, and roll’d amid the throng:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 50
				-
					-
						There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 51
				-
					-
						For dark in death the godlike owner lies!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 54
				-
					-
						That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And this stood adverse with the bended bow:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But harmless bounded from the plated steel.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 58
				-
					-
						As on some ample barn’s well harden’d floor,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 59
				-
					-
						(The winds collected at each open door,)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 60
				-
					-
						While the broad fan with force is whirl’d around,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 62
				-
					-
						So from the steel that guards Atrides’ heart,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Repell’d to distance flies the bounding dart.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp’d the bow.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Trail’d the long lance that mark’d with blood the sand:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 68
				-
					-
						But good Agenor gently from the wound
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 69
				-
					-
						The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 70
				-
					-
						A sling’s soft wool, snatch’d from a soldier’s side,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 47: Verse 71
				-
					-
						At once the tent and ligature supplied.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Behold! Pisander, urged by fate’s decree,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,

					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High-towering in the front, the warrior came.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The lance far distant by the winds was blown.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides’ shield:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Pisander’s spear fell shiver’d on the field.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not so discouraged, to the future blind,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Like lightning brandish’d his far beaming sword.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His left arm high opposed the shining shield:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His right beneath, the cover’d pole-axe held;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 15
				-
					-
						(An olive’s cloudy grain the handle made,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 17
				-
					-
						This on the helm discharged a noble blow;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The plume dropp’d nodding to the plain below,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The crashing bones before its force gave way;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And fierce Atrides spurn’d him as he bled,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 48: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O race perfidious, who delight in war!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Already noble deeds ye have perform’d;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A princess raped transcends a navy storm’d:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In such bold feats your impious might approve,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Without th’ assistance, or the fear of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The violated rites, the ravish’d dame;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Our heroes slaughter’d and our ships on flame,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Crimes heap’d on crimes, shall bend your glory down,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Above the thought of man, supremely wise!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 14
				-
					-
						From whence this favour to an impious foe?
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A godless crew, abandon’d and unjust,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Sleep’s balmy blessing, love’s endearing joy;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The feast, the dance; whate’er mankind desire,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 49: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.”

						This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bloody armour, which his train received:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then sudden mix’d among the warring crew,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Harpalion had through Asia travell’d far,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Following his martial father to the war:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Through filial love he left his native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Never, ah, never to behold it more!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Against the target of the Spartan king;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus of his lance disarm’d, from death he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And turns around his apprehensive eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Sunk in his sad companions’ arms he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And in short pantings sobb’d his soul away;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 19
				-
					-
						(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 50: Verse 20
				-
					-
						While life’s red torrent gush’d from out the wound.

						Him on his car the Paphlagonian train
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In slow procession bore from off the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The pensive father, father now no more!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And unavailing tears profusely shed;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.

						Paris from far the moving sight beheld,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With pity soften’d and with fury swell’d:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His honour’d host, a youth of matchless grace,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With his full strength he bent his angry bow,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And wing’d the feather’d vengeance at the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For riches much, and more for virtue famed.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who held his seat in Corinth’s stately town;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Polydus’ son, a seer of old renown.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Oft had the father told his early doom,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He climb’d his vessel, prodigal of breath,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And chose the certain glorious path to death.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 52: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And everlasting darkness shades him round.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 1

					-
						Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,

					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Wrapp’d in the cloud and tumult of the field:)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And conquest hovers o’er th’ Achaian bands;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With such a tide superior virtue sway’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 7

					-
						But in the centre Hector fix’d remain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain’d;

						(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.

					-
						And all the thunder of the battle raged,)

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There join’d, the whole Boeotian strength remains,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Locrians and Phthians, and th’ Epaean force;

						The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;

						Bias and great Menestheus at their head:

					-
						Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And brave Podarces, active in the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 53: Verse 25
				-
					-
						This drew from Phylacus his noble line;

					-
						Iphiclus’ son: and that (Oileus) thine:

					-
						(Young Ajax’ brother, by a stolen embrace;

					-
						Now side by side, with like unwearied care,

					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:

						So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Join’d to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-

						And trace large furrows with the shining share;

					-
						O’er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,

				-
					-
						And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 9

					-
						A train of heroes followed through the field,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who bore by turns great Ajax’ sevenfold shield;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whene’er he breathed, remissive of his might,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 13

					-
						No following troops his brave associate grace:

					-
						In close engagement an unpractised race,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But skill’d from far the flying shaft to wing,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 18

					-
						Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,

						Thus in the van the Telamonian train,

				-

				-
					-
						Throng’d in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 54: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,

						The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;

					-
						And the gall’d Ilians to their walls retired;

						But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,

					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Though great in all, thou seem’st averse to lend

						To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,

					-
						Content with what the bounteous gods have given,

						To some sweet music and the charm of song;

					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign’d
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;

					-
						Their guardians these, the nations round confess,

						If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,

						Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,

						Behold! distress’d within yon hostile wall,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 20
				-
					-
						How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 21
				-
					-
						What troops, out-number’d, scarce the war maintain!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 25

						Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)

						Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,

					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 28

						Contented with the conquest of the day.

					-
						I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 56: Verse 30

						Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;

						Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains

				Book 13: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Leap’d from his chariot on the trembling ground;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift as he leap’d his clanging arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,

						Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,

			-
				Book 13: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 1

						This said, the towering chief prepares to go,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And seems a moving mountain topp’d with snow.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,
					-
				-

						And bids anew the martial thunder rise.

						To Panthus’ son, at Hector’s high command

						Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:

				-

				-
					-
						But round the battlements, and round the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For many a chief he look’d, but look’d in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor Asius’ son, nor Asius’ self appear:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 58: Verse 15
				-
					-
						High on the wall some breathed their souls away.

				-
					-
						(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 59: Verse 3

					-
						The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 59: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Opprobrious thus, th’ impatient chief reproved:

			-
				Book 13: Stanza 60
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 60: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,

				-
					-
						As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 60: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The godlike father, and th’ intrepid son?
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 60: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;

						Black fate hang’s o’er thee from th’ avenging gods,

						When Paris thus: “My brother and my friend,

				-
					-
						Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In other battles I deserved thy blame,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,

						The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;

						Of all those heroes, two alone remain;

					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,

						Each now disabled by a hostile spear.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 11

						Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 12
				-
					-
						This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What with this arm I can, prepare to know,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.

					-
						But ’tis not ours, with forces not our own

						To combat: strength is of the gods alone.”

						These words the hero’s angry mind assuage:

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.

					-
						Around Polydamas, distain’d with blood,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,

						Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine,

						Wide o’er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;

					-
						Then, gather’d, settles on the hoary deeps;

						The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:

				-

					-
						Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Like Mars commission’d to confound mankind.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 38

						Before him flaming his enormous shield,

					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 40
				-
					-
						His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;

					-
						His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 61: Verse 42

					-
						And, while beneath his targe he flash’d along,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Shot terrors round, that wither’d e’en the strong.

			-
				Book 13: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 62: Verse 1

						Thus stalk’d he, dreadful; death was in his look:

				-
					-
						Whole nations fear’d; but not an Argive shook.

						“Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;

						’Tis not thy arm, ’tis thundering Jove we fear:

					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 13

					-
						Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 63: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior’s fame,

						On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.

					-
						To Jove’s glad omen all the Grecians rise,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:

					Book 13: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 64: Verse 6

						They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:

					-
						“From whence this menace, this insulting strain?

						(Not that short life which mortals lead below,

						With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,

					Book 13: Stanza 66: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With answering thunders fill’d the echoing plain;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 66: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A shout that tore heaven’s concave, and, above,

						Shook the fix’d splendours of the throne of Jove.

						The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 3: Verse 21

					-
						The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;
					-
				-

						Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,

					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king of men, Ulysses the divine,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 6

					-
						In lines advanced along the shelving strand:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain

						At length; beside the margin of the main,

						Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:

				-
					-
						Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 11

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Nestor’s approach alarm’d each Grecian breast,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Whom thus the general of the host address’d:

			-
				Book 14: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O grace and glory of the Achaian name;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill’d?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 5

						On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 7

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 10

						All this from Jove’s afflictive hand we bear,

				-

						Whence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 31: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Not thus I burn’d for fair Latona’s face,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 31: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Nor comelier Ceres’ more majestic grace.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 31: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not thus even for thyself I felt desire,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 31: Verse 18
				-
					-
						As now my veins receive the pleasing fire.”

				Book 14: Stanza 32

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke; the goddess with the charming eyes
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Glows with celestial red, and thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Is this a scene for love? On Ida’s height,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Exposed to mortal and immortal sight!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Our joys profaned by each familiar eye;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sport of heaven, and fable of the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						How shall I e’er review the blest abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or mix among the senate of the gods?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Shall I not think, that, with disorder’d charms,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						All heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With skill divine has Vulcan form’d thy bower,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sacred to love and to the genial hour;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If such thy will, to that recess retire,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In secret there indulge thy soft desire.”
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She ceased; and, smiling with superior love,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thus answer’d mild the cloud-compelling Jove:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not even the sun, who darts through heaven his rays,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys.”
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His eager arms around the goddess threw.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Glad Earth perceives, and from her bosom pours
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And clustering lotos swell’d the rising bed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And flamy crocus made the mountain glow
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Steep’d in soft joys and circumfused with air;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Celestial dews, descending o’er the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						At length, with love and sleep’s soft power oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now to the navy borne on silent wings,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To Neptune’s ear soft Sleep his message brings;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thus with gentle words address’d the god:
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The golden vision round his sacred head;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For Juno’s love, and Somnus’ pleasing ties,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Have closed those awful and eternal eyes.”
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus having said, the power of slumber flew,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						On human lids to drop the balmy dew.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And towering in the foremost ranks of war,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Indignant thus—“Oh once of martial fame!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						This half-recover’d day shall Troy obtain?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Shall Hector thunder at your ships again?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 16
				-
					-
						While stern Achilles in his wrath retires.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 17
				-
					-
						One hero’s loss too tamely you deplore,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Let to the weak the lighter arms belong,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thus arm’d, not Hector shall our presence stay;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 36: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Myself, ye Greeks! myself will lead the way.”
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The troops assent; their martial arms they change:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The busy chiefs their banded legions range.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The kings, though wounded, and oppress’d with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With helpful hands themselves assist the train.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus sheath’d in shining brass, in bright array
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The legions march, and Neptune leads the way:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His brandish’d falchion flames before their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Troy’s great defender stands alone unawed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The sea’s stern ruler there, and Hector here.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The roaring main, at her great master’s call,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Rose in huge ranks, and form’d a watery wall
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Around the ships: seas hanging o’er the shores,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						When stormy winds disclose the dark profound;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Less loud the winds that from the Æolian hall
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The first bold javelin, urged by Hector’s force,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Direct at Ajax’ bosom winged its course;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But there no pass the crossing belts afford,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(One braced his shield, and one sustain’d his sword.)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then back the disappointed Trojan drew,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And cursed the lance that unavailing flew:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But ’scaped not Ajax; his tempestuous hand
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 25
				-
					-
						(Where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior’s feet,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Toss’d round and round, the missive marble flings;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 28
				-
					-
						On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Full on his breast and throat with force descends;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Nor deaden’d there its giddy fury spends,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 31
				-
					-
						But whirling on, with many a fiery round,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 33
				-
					-
						As when the bolt, red-hissing from above,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And own the terrors of the almighty hand!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 39
				-
					-
						So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 40
				-
					-
						His slacken’d hand deserts the lance it bore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 41
				-
					-
						His following shield the fallen chief o’erspread;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Beneath his helmet dropp’d his fainting head;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 43
				-
					-
						His load of armour, sinking to the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Greece sees, in hope, Troy’s great defender slain:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 47
				-
					-
						All spring to seize him; storms of arrows fly,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And thicker javelins intercept the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 49
				-
					-
						In vain an iron tempest hisses round;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 50
				-
					-
						He lies protected, and without a wound.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Polydamas, Agenor the divine,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The pious warrior of Anchises’ line,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And each bold leader of the Lycian band,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 54
				-
					-
						With covering shields (a friendly circle) stand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 55
				-
					-
						His mournful followers, with assistant care,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The groaning hero to his chariot bear;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 57
				-
					-
						His foaming coursers, swifter than the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 38: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						When now they touch’d the mead’s enamell’d side,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Soon as the Greeks the chief’s retreat beheld,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With double fury each invades the field.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neis bore
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Amidst her flocks on Satnio’s silver shore;)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Struck through the belly’s rim, the warrior lies
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						An arduous battle rose around the dead;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Lo thus (the victor cries) we rule the field,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From this unerring hand there flies no dart
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But bathes its point within a Grecian heart.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Propp’d on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto’s dreary hall.”
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and sorrow touch’d each Argive breast:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The soul of Ajax burn’d above the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 42: Verse 3

						The foe, reclining, shunn’d the flying death;

						But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:

					-
						Thy lofty birth no succour could impart,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 42: Verse 8

					-
						The wings of death o’ertook thee on the dart;

						Swift to perform heaven’s fatal will, it fled

					Book 14: Stanza 42: Verse 10

					-
						Full on the juncture of the neck and head,

						And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain:

					-
						The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.

				-

						So just the stroke, that yet the body stood

						So swift flew Juno to the bless’d abodes,

					-
						If thought of man can match the speed of gods.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-

						There sat the powers in awful synod placed;

				-
					-
						They bow’d, and made obeisance as she pass’d

						Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown’d

				-
					-
						“Enough thou know’st the tyrant of the skies,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,

				-
					-
						Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain’d his will.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 6

						Bid the crown’d nectar circle round the hall:

						But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome

						Such stern decrees, such threaten’d woes to come,

						Thus she proceeds—“Attend, ye powers above!

						And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.

						Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,

						But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;

					-
						Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o’erthrown,

				-
					-
						Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;

						Dares, though the thunder bursting o’er my head

						With that he gives command to Fear and Flight
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To join his rapid coursers for the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 3

					-
						Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;

					-
						Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 5

					-
						And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,

						Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.

				-
					-
						Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,

				-

						“By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss’d?

					-
						Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,

					-
						And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 7

					-
						Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 8

				-
					-
						Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 13

					-
						Why should heaven’s law with foolish man comply
					-
				-

						Exempted from the race ordain’d to die?”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 1

						This menace fix’d the warrior to his throne;

				-
					-
						Sullen he sat, and curb’d the rising groan.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then Juno call’d (Jove’s orders to obey)
					-
				-

						The winged Iris, and the god of day.
					-
				-

						“Go wait the Thunderer’s will (Saturnia cried)

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 3

					-
						(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)

						There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls

				-
					-
						The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 7

						Veil’d in a mist of fragrance him they found,

						“Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,

						To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.

					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then Greece shall breathe from toils.” The godhead said;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His will divine the son of Jove obey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Glides down the mountain to the plain below.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						There Hector seated by the stream he sees,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						His sense returning with the coming breeze;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Again his loved companions meet his eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Jove thinking of his pains, they pass’d away,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To whom the god who gives the golden day:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why sits great Hector from the field so far?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The fainting hero, as the vision bright
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stood shining o’er him, half unseal’d his sight:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What blest immortal, with commanding breath,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Had almost sunk me to the shades below?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And hell’s black horrors swim before my eye.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him Apollo: “Be no more dismay’d;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And breathed immortal ardour from above.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when the pamper’d steed, with reins unbound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And springs, exulting, to his fields again:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						As when the force of men and dogs combined
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Far from the hunter’s rage secure they lie
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						When lo! a lion shoots across the way!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And mark’d their progress through the ranks in blood,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Soon as they see the furious chief appear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 26: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thoas, the bravest of the Ætolian force;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Skill’d to direct the javelin’s distant flight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And bold to combat in the standing fight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not more in councils famed for solid sense,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill’d:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						What god restores him to the frighted field;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And not content that half of Greece lie slain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pours new destruction on her sons again?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The Greeks’ main body to the fleet command;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The valiant leader of the Cretan band;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Behind, unnumber’d multitudes attend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To flank the navy, and the shores defend.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Hector first came towering to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						High held before him, Jove’s enormous shield
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						From different parts, and mingle in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						These drink the life of generous warriors slain:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Sat doubtful conquest hovering o’er the field;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Their force is humbled, and their fear confess’d.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 27
				-
					-
						So flies a herd of oxen, scatter’d wide,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 28
				-
					-
						No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When two fell lions from the mountain come,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 34
				-
					-
						First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 35
				-
					-
						One to the bold Boeotians ever dear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And one Menestheus’ friend and famed compeer.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Medon and Iasus, Æneas sped;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 38
				-
					-
						This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 39
				-
					-
						But hapless Medon from Oileus came;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Him Ajax honour’d with a brother’s name,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Though born of lawless love: from home expell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 42
				-
					-
						A banish’d man, in Phylace he dwell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Press’d by the vengeance of an angry wife;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Troy ends at last his labours and his life.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Mecystes next Polydamas o’erthrew;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 47
				-
					-
						By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Polites’ arm laid Echius on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Stretch’d on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 51
				-
					-
						The Greeks dismay’d, confused, disperse or fall,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 53
				-
					-
						While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And o’er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 55
				-
					-
						On rush’d bold Hector, gloomy as the night;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Points to the fleet: “For, by the gods! who flies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 59
				-
					-
						No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 60
				-
					-
						No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 62
				-
					-
						The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.”
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 66
				-
					-
						The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Apollo, planted at the trench’s bound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Push’d at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Roll’d in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 70
				-
					-
						A sudden road! a long and ample way.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 71
				-
					-
						O’er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The wondering crowds the downward level trod;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Before them flamed the shield, and march’d the god.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Easy as when ashore an infant stands,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And draws imagined houses in the sands;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Sweeps the slight works and fashion’d domes away:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Thus vanish’d at thy touch, the towers and walls;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 29: Verse 82
				-
					-
						The toil of thousands in a moment falls.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,

				Book 15: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						One Greek enrich’d thy shrine with offer’d gore;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If e’er, in hope our country to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If e’er thou sign’st our wishes with thy nod:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Perform the promise of a gracious god!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This day preserve our navies from the flame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 31: Verse 8

						And save the relics of the Grecian name.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And peals of thunder shook the firmament.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And catch’d new fury at the voice divine.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus loudly roaring, and o’erpowering all,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Legions on legions from each side arise:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus the thunder of the battle raged,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And labouring armies round the works engaged,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With bitter groans his sorrows he express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Charged with Achilles’ high command I go,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A mournful witness of this scene of woe;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						I haste to urge him by his country’s care
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To rise in arms, and shine again in war.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The voice is powerful of a faithful friend.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With equal hand he guides his whole design,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By the just rule, and the directing line:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The martial leaders, with like skill and care,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And every ship sustained an equal tide.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						At one proud bark, high-towering o’er the fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 20
				-
					-
						That fix’d as fate, this acted by a god.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The son of Clytius in his daring hand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But, pierced by Telamon’s huge lance, expires:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish’d fires.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Great Hector view’d him with a sad survey,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 26
				-
					-
						As stretch’d in dust before the stern he lay.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 27
				-
					-
						“Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 34: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But Ajax shunn’d the meditated blow.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						It stretch’d in dust unhappy Lycophron:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						An exile long, sustain’d at Ajax’ board,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A faithful servant to a foreign lord;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In peace, and war, for ever at his side,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And lies a lifeless load along the land.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thus inflames his brother to the fight:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Teucer, behold! extended on the shore
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Dear as a parent, with a parent’s care
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To fight our wars he left his native air.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 5

						This death deplored, to Hector’s rage we owe;

					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Where are those darts on which the fates attend?
					-
				-

						And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Before the chief his ample bow display’d;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then hiss’d his arrow, and the bowstring sung.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Clytus, Pisenor’s son, renown’d in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(To thee, Polydamas! an honour’d name)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						As all on glory ran his ardent mind,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The pointed death arrests him from behind:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In youth’s first bloom reluctantly he dies.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Hurl’d from the lofty seat, at distance far,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then, fired to vengeance, rush’d amidst the foe:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Rage edged his sword, and strengthen’d every blow.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Once more bold Teucer, in his country’s cause,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At Hector’s breast a chosen arrow draws:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And had the weapon found the destined way,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown’d that day.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But Hector was not doom’d to perish then:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The all-wise disposer of the fates of men
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor was such glory due to Teucer’s hands.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Down dropp’d the bow: the shaft with brazen head
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The astonish’d archer to great Ajax cries;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						“Some god prevents our destined enterprise:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Strong to impel the flight of many a dart.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shall find its match—No more: ’tis ours to fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The fourfold buckler o’er his shoulder tied;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On his brave head a crested helm he placed,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This Hector saw, and thus express’d his joy:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And spread your glory with the navy’s flame.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When happy nations bear the marks divine!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						How easy then, to see the sinking state
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And for our country, ’tis a bliss to die.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Entails a debt on all the grateful state;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His wife live honour’d, all his race succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 41: Verse 20
				-

						And late posterity enjoy the deed!”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address’d:

						How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet undetermined, or to live or die?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What hopes remain, what methods to retire,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Mark how the flames approach, how near they fall,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						’Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To your own hands are trusted all your fates;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And better far in one decisive strife,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 14
				-
					-
						One day should end our labour or our life,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 43: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Still press’d, and press’d by such inglorious hands.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The listening Grecians feel their leader’s flame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And every kindling bosom pants for fame.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Chief of the foot, of old Antenor’s race.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The fierce commander of the Epeian band.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But Croesmus’ bosom took the flying spear:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But Meges, Phyleus’ ample breastplate wore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(Well-known in fight on Selle’s winding shore;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Which oft, in cities storm’d, and battles won,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Had saved the father, and now saves the son.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Full at the Trojan’s head he urged his lance,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 27
				-
					-
						New ting’d with Tyrian dye: in dust below,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And stood by Meges’ side a sudden aid.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Through Dolops’ shoulder urged his forceful dart,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Which held its passage through the panting heart,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And issued at his breast. With thundering sound
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The warrior falls, extended on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 35
				-
					-
						In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 36
				-
					-
						But Hector’s voice excites his kindred train;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 39
				-
					-
						He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross’d the main)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Fed his large oxen on Percote’s plain;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 41
				-
					-
						But when oppress’d, his country claim’d his care,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Return’d to Ilion, and excell’d in war;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 43
				-
					-
						For this, in Priam’s court, he held his place,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Beloved no less than Priam’s royal race.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O’ermatch’d he falls; to two at once a prey,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Come on—a distant war no longer wage,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But hand to hand thy country’s foes engage:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or Ilion from her towery height descend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In one sad sepulchre, one common fall.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Hector (this said) rush’d forward on the foes:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With equal ardour Melanippus glows:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then Ajax thus—“O Greeks! respect your fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On valour’s side the odds of combat lie;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His generous sense he not in vain imparts;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And flank the navy with a brazen wall;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And stop the Trojans, though impell’d by Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						So strong to fight, so active to pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said; and backward to the lines retired;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Forth rush’d the youth with martial fury fired,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And round the black battalions cast his view.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						While the swift javelin hiss’d along in air.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Advancing Melanippus met the dart
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus on a roe the well-breath’d beagle flies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The distant hunter sent into his heart.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Observing Hector to the rescue flew;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So when a savage, ranging o’er the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Has torn the shepherd’s dog, or shepherd’s swain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While conscious of the deed, he glares around,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And hears the gathering multitude resound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 24
				-
					-
						While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But enter’d in the Grecian ranks, he turns
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 48: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His manly breast, and with new fury burns.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The sire of gods, confirming Thetis’ prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Grecian ardour quench’d in deep despair;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But lifts to glory Troy’s prevailing bands,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On Ida’s top he waits with longing eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To view the navy blazing to the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Trojans fly, and conquer’d Ilion burn.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						These fates revolved in his almighty mind,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He raises Hector to the work design’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The radiant helmet on his temple burns,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides’ spear:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Yet Jove deferr’d the death he was to pay,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 49: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And gave what fate allow’d, the honours of a day!
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Burn at each foe, and single every prize;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He points his ardour, and exerts his might.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On all sides batter’d, yet resists his power:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So some tall rock o’erhangs the hoary main,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By winds assail’d, by billows beat in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And sees the watery mountains break below.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And, swell’d with tempests, on the ship descends;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 15
				-
					-
						White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Howl o’er the masts, and sing through every shroud:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And instant death on every wave appears.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 50: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when a lion, rushing from his den,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Amidst the plain of some wide-water’d fen,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-

						Leaps on the herds before the herdsman’s eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The minister of stern Eurystheus’ ire
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The son redeem’d the honours of the race,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A son as generous as the sire was base;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 17
				-
					-
						O’er all his country’s youth conspicuous far
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In every virtue, or of peace or war:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But doom’d to Hector’s stronger force to yield!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Against the margin of his ample shield
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 23
				-
					-
						On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His circling friends, who strove to guard too late
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 51: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Now man the next, receding toward the main:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Wall’d round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Now fear itself confines them to the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)

						Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;

				-
					-
						And by their parents, by themselves implores.

						With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 53: Verse 3

						Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care

				-
					-
						Your wives, your infants, and your parents share:
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Think of each living father’s reverend head;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 53: Verse 6

					-
						Think of each ancestor with glory dead;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 53: Verse 7

					-
						Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,
					-
				-

					-
						The gods their fates on this one action lay,

						And all are lost, if you desert the day.”

						He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;

				-
					-
						Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 3

						The mist of darkness Jove around them threw
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						She clear’d, restoring all the war to view;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A sudden ray shot beaming o’er the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And show’d the shores, the navy, and the main:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His port majestic, and his ample size:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Nor fights, like others, fix’d to certain stands
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But looks a moving tower above the bands;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The godlike hero stalks from side to side.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So when a horseman from the watery mead
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 18
				-
					-
						(Skill’d in the manage of the bounding steed)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To some great city through the public way;

				-

				-
					-
						Safe in his art, as side by side they run,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And now to this, and now to that he flies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 54: Verse 24

						Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 1

						From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,

					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						No less the wonder of the warring crew.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As furious, Hector thunder’d threats aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And rush’d enraged before the Trojan crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lay rank’d contiguous on the bending shores;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So the strong eagle from his airy height,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who marks the swans’ or cranes’ embodied flight,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The warring nations meet, the battle roars,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 16
				-
					-
						No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As if new vigour from new fights they won,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And the long battle was but then begun.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Greece, yet unconquer’d, kept alive the war,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Secure of death, confiding in despair:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Troy in proud hopes already view’d the main
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 55: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And each contends, as his were all the war.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						’Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						First seized a ship on that contested strand;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The same which dead Protesilaus bore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The first that touch’d the unhappy Trojan shore:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For this in arms the warring nations stood,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Wounded, they wound; and seek each other’s hearts
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten’d darts.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 56: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Still raging, Hector with his ample hand
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:

			-
				Book 15: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years

						Is finished; and the day desired appears!
					-
				-

						This happy day with acclamations greet,

				-
					-
						Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The coward-counsels of a timorous throng
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of reverend dotards check’d our glory long:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Too long Jove lull’d us with lethargic charms,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But now in peals of thunder calls to arms:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In this great day he crowns our full desires,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 58: Verse 10

						Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires.”

						Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band.

						Stepp’d back, and doubted or to live or die.

					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						At the last edge of yon deserted land!

					-
						Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Yon ample trench had buried half her host.

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 46

						No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 47

						Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;

						No longer flames the lance of Tydeus’ son;

				-
					-
						No more your general calls his heroes on:

				-
					-
						Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 55

						But heed my words, and mark a friend’s command,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Rage uncontroll’d through all the hostile crew,

						But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.

						Though Jove in thunder should command the war,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-

						The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,

					-
						Nor lead to Ilion’s walls the Grecian race;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-

						Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-

						Let Greece, redeem’d from this destructive strait,

				-

						O! would to all the immortal powers above,

						Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						That not one Trojan might be left alive,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And not a Greek of all the race survive:

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Might only we the vast destruction shun,

				-
					-
						And only we destroy the accursed town!”
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Great Jove with conquest crown’d the Trojan band.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 77

					-
						Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain’d,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 78
				-
					-
						So thick the darts an iron tempest rain’d:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 79
				-
					-
						On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 80
				-
					-
						His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 81
				-
					-
						His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And painful sweat from all his members flows.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Spent and o’erpower’d, he barely breathes at most;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Dangers on dangers all around him glow,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 86

						And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.

				-
					-
						Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 3

					-
						Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 4

					-
						That the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 7

				-
					-
						Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Warn’d he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 11

						O’er the high stern the curling volumes rise,

					-
						Divine Achilles view’d the rising flames,

				-
					-
						And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.
					-
				-

						Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;

						Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;

						I haste to bring the troops.”—The hero said;

					-
						The friend with ardour and with joy obey’d.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 1

				-
					-
						His manly legs, with silver buckles bound
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 3

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 4

					-
						The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 5

					-
						Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:

						Achilles’ shield his ample shoulders spread,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 8

						Adorn’d in all his terrible array,

						Alone untouch’d, Pelides’ javelin stands,

						From Pelion’s shady brow the plant entire

						Whose son’s great arm alone the weapon wields,

						When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;

				-
					-
						When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Has drench’d their wide insatiate throats with blood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 12: Verse 13

						Like furious, rush’d the Myrmidonian crew,

						Her, sly Cellenius loved: on her would gaze,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						As with swift step she form’d the running maze:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To her high chamber from Diana’s quire,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The god pursued her, urged, and crown’d his fire.

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 7

					-
						Strong Echecleus, bless’d in all those charms
					-

						That pleased a god, succeeded to her arms;

				-
					-
						Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 12

					-
						With gifts of price he sought and won the dame;

				-
					-
						Her secret offspring to her sire she bare;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 15: Verse 14

				-
					-
						“Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Think what reproach these ears endured so long;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						‘Stern son of Peleus, (thus ye used to say,

				-
					-
						While restless, raging, in your ships you lay)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 9

					-
						Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field:

						What make we here? Return, ye chiefs, return!’
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-

						Such were your words—Now, warriors! grieve no more,

					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Lo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 18: Verse 15

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Close and more close the listening cohorts press’d;

						Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring

						As when a circling wall the builder forms,

						So helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,

						But mindful of the gods, Achilles went
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To the rich coffer in his shady tent;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There lay on heaps his various garments roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(The presents of the silver-footed dame)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Which never man had stained with ruddy wine,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But Peleus’ son; and Peleus’ son to none
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He purged; and wash’d it in the running stream.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour’d
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-

						Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:

					-
						“O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!

				-
					-
						Who ’midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,

						(Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround,

						Oh! be his guard thy providential care,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:

				-
					-
						Press’d by his single force let Hector see
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His fame in arms not owing all to me.

					-
						But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 22: Verse 20

						Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,

					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But Troy repulsed, and scatter’d o’er the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As Areilycus had turn’d him round,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The thigh transfix’d, and broke the brittle bone:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy breast, unarm’d, received the Spartan lance.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Phylides’ dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.

				-
					-
						In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother’s wound,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His arm falls spouting on the dust below:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He sinks, with endless darkness cover’d o’er:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.

						Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sarpedon’s friends, Amisodarus’ seed;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The bane of men, abhorr’d Chimaera bred;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Skill’d in the dart in vain, his sons expire,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.

			-
				Book 16: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 1

					-
						Stopp’d in the tumult Cleobulus lies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Beneath Oileus’ arm, a living prize;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A living prize not long the Trojan stood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.

			-
				Book 16: Stanza 32
			-

					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In vain their javelins at each other flew,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The daring Lycon aim’d a noble blow;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Full on the juncture of the neck and head:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The head, divided by a stroke so just,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.

			-
				Book 16: Stanza 33

					-
						O’ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next Erymas was doom’d his fate to feel,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His open’d mouth received the Cretan steel:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Crash’d the thin bones, and drown’d the teeth in gore:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when the flocks neglected by the swain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter’d o’er the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim’d,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O’er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Dark o’er the fields the ascending vapour flies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So from the ships, along the dusky plain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The fiery coursers forced their lord away:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While far behind his Trojans fall confused;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In vain they labour up the steepy mound;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch’d from sight.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Scour o’er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Loud o’er the rout was heard the victor’s cry,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Where horse and arms, and chariots lie o’erthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And bleeding heroes under axles groan.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 25
				-
					-
						No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 26
				-
					-
						From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 27
				-
					-
						High-bounding o’er the fosse, the whirling car
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Smokes through the ranks, o’ertakes the flying war,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And earth is loaden with incessant showers;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 35
				-
					-
						(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 37
				-
					-
						From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Whole fields are drown’d, and mountains swept away;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 37: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And trembling man sees all his labours vain!
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now the chief (the foremost troops repell’d)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Back to the ships his destined progress held,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Between the space where silver Simois flows,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And fell the victim of his coward fear;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Patroclus mark’d him as he shunn’d the war,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And dropp’d the flowing reins. Him ’twixt the jaws,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						As on a rock that overhangs the main,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 20
				-
					-
						An angler, studious of the line and cane,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 38: Verse 24
				-
					-
						He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And death involved him with the shades of hell.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Where’er he moves, the growing slaughters spread
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With this reproach his flying host he warms:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						This hand unaided shall the war sustain:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The task be mine this hero’s strength to try,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when two vultures on the mountain’s height
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With equal clamours, and with equal rage.

						Jove view’d the combat: whose event foreseen,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Already on the verge of death he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His life is owed to fierce Patroclus’ hands,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What passions in a parent’s breast debate!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And send him safe to Lycia, distant far
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From all the dangers and the toils of war;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose bounds were fix’d before his race began?
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						How many sons of gods, foredoom’d to death,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And when the ascending soul has wing’d her flight,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The breathless body to his native land.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His friends and people, to his future praise,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And lasting honours to his ashes give;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 43: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His fame (’tis all the dead can have) shall live.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then touch’d with grief, the weeping heavens distill’d
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A shower of blood o’er all the fatal field:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The god, his eyes averting from the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Laments his son, predestined to be slain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Now met in arms, the combatants appear;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From strong Patroclus’ hand the javelin fled,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And pass’d the groin of valiant Thrasymed;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The first aloof with erring fury flew,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The next transpierced Achilles’ mortal steed,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Fix’d in the shoulder’s joint, he reel’d around,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Roll’d in the bloody dust, and paw’d the slippery ground.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 22
				-
					-
						When bold Automedon, to disengage
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Divides the traces with his sword, and freed
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The rest move on, obedient to the rein:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 44: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The car rolls slowly o’er the dusty plain.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And first Sarpedon whirl’d his weighty lance,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And spent in empty air its dying force.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not so Patroclus’ never-erring dart;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Aim’d at his breast it pierced a mortal part,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 11
				-
					-
						It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Before his chariot stretch’d his form divine:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He grasp’d the dust distain’d with streaming gore,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So lies a bull beneath the lion’s paws,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 17
				-
					-
						While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 45: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then to the leader of the Lycian band
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The dying chief address’d his last command;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The glorious dangers of destructive war,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To lead my troops, to combat at their head,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Incite the living, and supply the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon’s death.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						If these spoil’d arms adorn a Grecian foe!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Defend my body, conquer in my right:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That, taught by great examples, all may try
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.”
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 15
				-
					-
						He ceased; the Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And his eyes darken’d with the shades of death.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The insulting victor with disdain bestrode
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 21
				-
					-
						From the wide wound gush’d out a stream of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And the soul issued in the purple flood.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 23
				-
					-
						His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Unguided now, their mighty master slain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 25
				-
					-
						All-impotent of aid, transfix’d with grief,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 27
				-
					-
						His painful arm, yet useless with the smart
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Inflicted late by Teucer’s deadly dart,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Supported on his better hand he stay’d:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 46: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To Phoebus then (’twas all he could) he pray’d:
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia’s coast,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Powerful alike to ease the wretch’s smart;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O hear me! god of every healing art!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I stand unable to sustain the spear,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To guard the relics of my slaughter’d friend:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To head my Lycians, and support the fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His heavenly hand restrain’d the flux of blood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He drew the dolours from the wounded part,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Renew’d by art divine, the hero stands,

				-
					-
						And owns the assistance of immortal hands.

					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						First to the fight his native troops he warms,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then loudly calls on Troy’s vindictive arms;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With ample strides he stalks from place to place;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 49

				-
					-
						“What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?

				-
					-
						Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Those generous friends, who, from their country far,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Breathe their brave souls out in another’s war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 5

					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In action valiant, and in council wise,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Who guarded right, and kept his people free;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Stretch’d by Patroclus’ arm on yonder plains,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						O save from hostile rage his loved remains!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Ah let not Greece his conquer’d trophies boast,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 49: Verse 12

						Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 1

						He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:

					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Transfix’d with deep regret, they view o’erthrown
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						At once his country’s pillar, and their own;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A chief, who led to Troy’s beleaguer’d wall
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A host of heroes, and outshined them all.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-

						Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,

			-
				Book 16: Stanza 51

						But o’er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,

						And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:

						The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,

						To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;

						Agacleus’ son, from Budium’s lofty walls;

				-

						Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 54: Verse 4

						To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;

						Now sent to Troy, Achilles’ arms to aid,

				-

						Soon as his luckless hand had touch’d the dead,

				-

						A rock’s large fragment thunder’d on his head;

					-
						Hurl’d by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 54: Verse 10

					-
						And, like an eagle darting at his game,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 3

						Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That arm, drew back; and Hector learn’d to fear.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Far as an able hand a lance can throw,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So far the Trojans from their lines retired;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The only hope of Chalcon’s trembling age;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the land was stretch’d his large domain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 18

				-

				-
					-
						Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 55: Verse 20

				-
					-
						With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,

				-

					-
						And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Despatch’d by Merion to the shades of death:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On Ida’s holy hill he made abode,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 4

					-
						The priest of Jove, and honour’d like his god.
					-
				-

						Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;

						The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.

				-
					-
						Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The lance hiss’d harmless o’er his covering shield,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 56: Verse 12

				-
					-
						“Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 69: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 69: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 69: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles’ hand.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 70
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His panting coursers, in his breast debates,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or in the field his forces to employ,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In Asius’ shape, who reigned by Sangar’s flood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus he accosts him. “What a shameful sight!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 12
				-
					-
						God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Were thine my vigour this successful spear
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And in Patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 70: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 71
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The god the Grecians’ sinking souls depress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pour’d swift spirits through each Trojan breast.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A spear his left, a stone employs his right:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The falling ruin crush’d Cebrion’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The lawless offspring of king Priam’s bed;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish’d wound:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 71: Verse 18
				-
					-
						While the proud victor thus his fall derides.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 72
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 72: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 72: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 72: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 72: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pity that all their practice is by land!”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 73
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And from his fatal courage finds his bane.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 7
				-
					-
						At once bold Hector leaping from his car,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Defends the body, and provokes the war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus for some slaughter’d hind, with equal rage,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Stern Hector fastens on the warrior’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 15
				-
					-
						While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And the whole forest in one crash descends.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 24
				-
					-
						In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Darts shower’d on darts, now round the carcase ring;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 73: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And, stretch’d in death, forgets the guiding reins!
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 74
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While on each host with equal tempests fell
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But when his evening wheels o’erhung the main,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 8
				-
					-
						They draw the conquer’d corse and radiant arms.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 13
				-
					-
						There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The last, black remnant of so bright a line:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 74: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 75
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 1
				-
					-
						For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn’d senses reel
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Achilles’ plume is stain’d with dust and gore;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That plume which never stoop’d to earth before;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Long used, untouch’d, in fighting fields to shine,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And shade the temples of the mad divine.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Jove dooms it now on Hector’s helm to nod;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 75: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 76
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The corslet his astonish’d breast forsakes:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 76: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such is the force of more than mortal hands!
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 77
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 1
				-
					-
						A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Skill’d in the dart, and matchless in the course:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 6
				-
					-
						While yet he learn’d his rudiments of war.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His venturous spear first drew the hero’s gore;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor, though disarm’d, Patroclus’ fury stood:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And turn’d him short, and herded in the crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Retires for succour to his social train,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Her yet-surviving heroes seem’d to fall.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 22
				-
					-
						So, scorch’d with heat, along the desert score,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear’d with blood;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 26
				-
					-
						At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o’erthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 29
				-
					-
						So many lives effused, expires his own.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 30
				-
					-
						As dying now at Hector’s feet he lies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 77: Verse 31
				-
					-
						He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 78
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Though much at parting that great chief might say,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 78: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And much enjoin thee, this important day.
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 79
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 79: Verse 1
				-
					-
						‘Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 79: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.’
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 79: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He spoke, Patroclus march’d, and thus he sped.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 80
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 80: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 80: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 81
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Jove’s and Apollo’s is this deed, not thine;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To heaven is owed whate’er your own you call,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 7
				-
					-
						By fate and Phoebus was I first o’erthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Black fate o’erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 81: Verse 13

						(The beauteous body left a load of clay)

						Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;

						On the pale carcase, thus address’d the dead:

						“From whence this boding speech, the stern decree

						Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?

						Why not as well Achilles’ fate be given

						His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;

						And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 85: Verse 4

						He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.

					-
						His words infix’d unutterable care
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Deep in great Hector’s soul: through all the war
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view’d

						And in the victor’s hands the shining prey.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 8: Verse 9

					-
						Sheath’d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 8: Verse 10

						And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,

				-

						Atrides from the voice the storm divined,

						“Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,

					-
						His manly breast, and with new fury burn’d;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						O’er all the black battalions sent his view,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 10: Verse 8

						There breathing courage, where the god of day

				-
					-
						Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 9

						Already had stern Hector seized his head,

					-
						And doom’d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;

					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 12

				-
					-
						Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;

					-
						And now before, and now behind he stood:

					-
						Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,

						But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,

						On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:

						Is this, O chief! a hero’s boasted fame?

						Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ

						“Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 1

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The sable plumage nodded o’er his head:)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						One instant saw, one instant overtook
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The distant band, that on the sandy shore
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow’d;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His train to Troy convey’d the massy load.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The work and present of celestial hands;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						By aged Peleus to Achilles given,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His father’s arms not long Achilles wears,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Forbid by fate to reach his father’s years.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The god whose thunder rends the troubled air
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, conscious, look’d through all the scene of fate.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He shook the sacred honours of his head;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 8

					-
						In heavenly panoply divinely bright

						Thou stand’st, and armies tremble at thy sight,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						As at Achilles’ self! beneath thy dart
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Lies slain the great Achilles’ dearer part.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A blaze of glory ere thou fad’st away.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For ah! no more Andromache shall come
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						No more officious, with endearing charms,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides’ arms!”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then with his sable brow he gave the nod
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That seals his word; the sanction of the god.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The stubborn arms (by Jove’s command disposed)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Conform’d spontaneous, and around him closed:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fill’d with the god, enlarged his members grew,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The blood in brisker tides began to roll,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And look’d, and moved, Achilles, or a god.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The great Thersilochus like fury found,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And Ennomus, in augury renown’d.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber’d bands

					-
						To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:

						Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,

						Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;

					-
						To die or conquer are the terms of war.

					-
						Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;

				-
					-
						Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,

						“Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;

						And all our wars and glories at an end!
					-
				-

				-
					-
						’Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Condemn’d to vultures on the Trojan plain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 1

				-
					-
						The field re-echoed the distressful sound.

				-
					-
						Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,

						Oilean Ajax first the voice obey’d,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 4

					-
						And Merion, burning with a hero’s rage.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The long-succeeding numbers who can name?
					-
				-

						But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;

				-
					-
						Whole Troy embodied rush’d with shouts along.
					-
				-

						Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,

				-
					-
						Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 11

						Full in the mouth is stopp’d the rushing tide,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The boiling ocean works from side to side,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The river trembles to his utmost shore,

					-
						Jove, pouring darkness o’er the mingled fight,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Conceals the warriors’ shining helms in night:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Dead he protects him with superior care.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Ajax to Peleus’ son the second name,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In graceful stature next, and next in fame.)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And rudely scatters, for a distance round,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The frighted hunter and the baying hound.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus’ heir,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Hippothous, dragg’d the carcase through the war;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With thongs inserted through the double wound:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Inevitable fate o’ertakes the deed;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Doom’d by great Ajax’ vengeful lance to bleed:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						It cleft the helmet’s brazen cheeks in twain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The shatter’d crest and horse-hair strow the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With nerves relax’d he tumbles to the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He drops Patroclus’ foot, and o’er him spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Now lies a sad companion of the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Far from Larissa lies, his native air,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And ill requites his parents’ tender care.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Lamented youth! in life’s first bloom he fell,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Once more at Ajax Hector’s javelin flies;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shunn’d the descending death; which hissing on,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stretch’d in the dust the great Iphytus’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In little Panope, for strength renown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In clanging arms the hero fell and all
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fields resounded with his weighty fall.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 29

				-
					-
						Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Telamonian lance his belly rends;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The hollow armour burst before the stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In strong convulsions panting on the sands
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-

						He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And now had Troy, by Greece compell’d to yield,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fled to her ramparts, and resign’d the field;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Greece, in her native fortitude elate,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With Jove averse, had turn’d the scale of fate:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But Phoebus urged Æneas to the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He seem’d like aged Periphas to sight:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(A herald in Anchises’ love grown old,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus he—“What methods yet, O chief! remain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And gain’d at length the glorious odds of fate:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His partial favour, and assists your wars,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Your shameful efforts ’gainst yourselves employ,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Æneas through the form assumed descries
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The power conceal’d, and thus to Hector cries:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bold example all his hosts pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who view’d his fall, and, grieving at the chance,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The whirling lance, with vigorous force address’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Descends, and pants in Apisaon’s breast;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From rich Paeonia’s vales the warrior came,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And rush’d to combat, but he rush’d in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Indissolubly firm, around the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And hemm’d with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And in an orb contracts the crowded war,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And stands the centre and the soul of all:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Fix’d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 22
				-
					-
						A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 23
				-
					-
						On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Greece, in close order, and collected might,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Seem’d as extinct: day ravish’d from their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And all heaven’s splendours blotted from the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Such o’er Patroclus’ body hung the night,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No vapour rested on the mountain’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The golden sun pour’d forth a stronger ray,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And all the broad expansion flamed with day.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And here and there their scatter’d arrows light:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But death and darkness o’er the carcase spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						There burn’d the war, and there the mighty bled.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor knew the fortune of Achilles’ friend;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In thought they view’d him still, with martial joy,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thick and heavy grows the work of death:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O’erlabour’d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As when a slaughter’d bull’s yet reeking hide,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Strain’d with full force, and tugg’d from side to side,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o’er
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So tugging round the corse both armies stood;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 13

					-
						While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Not Pallas’ self, her breast when fury warms,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign’d;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain’d.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Achilles in his ships at distance lay,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He, yet unconscious of Patroclus’ fall,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In dust extended under Ilion’s wall,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And for his wish’d return prepares in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal’d;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The rest, in pity to her son, conceal’d.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)

						Who dares desert this well-disputed day!
					-
				-

						First may the cleaving earth before our eyes

						First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 39
			-
				-

						Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,

						Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Their godlike master slain before their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They wept, and shared in human miseries.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						On some good man or woman unreproved
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Lays its eternal weight; or fix’d, as stands
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A marble courser by the sculptor’s hands,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Placed on the hero’s grave. Along their face
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Trail’d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And prone to earth was hung their languid head:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Nor Jove disdain’d to cast a pitying look,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 41: Verse 20
				-
					-
						While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Did we your race on mortal man bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For ah! what is there of inferior birth,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What wretched creature of what wretched kind,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A miserable race! but cease to mourn:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						For not by you shall Priam’s son be borne
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						High on the splendid car: one glorious prize
					-
				-

				-
					-
						He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Automedon your rapid flight shall bear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Safe to the navy through the storm of war.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For yet ’tis given to Troy to ravage o’er
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 42: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall
					-
				-

						He said; and breathing in the immortal horse

				-
					-
						Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The kindling chariot through the parted war:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So flies a vulture through the clamorous train
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 6

					-
						Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,

					-
						And now to conquest with like speed pursue;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:

				-
					-
						Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 43: Verse 12

					-
						“What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,

					-
						“In happy time (the charioteer replies)

						The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;

				-
					-
						No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,

						Or holds their fury in suspended reins:

						Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,

						He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And call’d Æneas fighting near his side.

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 47
			-

						Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.

						Can such opponents stand when we assail?

						The son of Venus to the counsel yields;

					-
						Then o’er their backs they spread their solid shields:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 4

					-
						And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.

					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-

						In vain advance! not fated to return.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Unmov’d, Automedon attends the fight,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For hard the fight, determined is the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						’Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With great Atrides. “Hither turn, (he said,)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Turn where distress demands immediate aid;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And save the living from a fiercer foe.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Unhelp’d we stand, unequal to engage
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The force of Hector, and Æneas’ rage:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which pass’d the shield of Aretus the young:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						It pierced his belt, emboss’d with curious art,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then in the lower belly struck the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when a ponderous axe, descending full,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Struck ’twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now at Automedon the Trojan foe
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Stooping, he shunn’d; the javelin idly fled,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And hiss’d innoxious o’er the hero’s head;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In long vibrations spent its fury there.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But left their slain companion in his blood:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His arms Automedon divests, and cries,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						“Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So looks the lion o’er a mangled boar,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And o’er his seat the bloody trophies hung.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now Minerva from the realms of air
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Descends impetuous, and renews the war;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when high Jove denouncing future woe,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						O’er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,

				-
					-
						The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,

					-
						And from his half-till’d field the labourer flies:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In such a form the goddess round her drew
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Assuming Phoenix’ shape on earth she falls,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 14

				-
					-
						“And lies Achilles’ friend, beloved by all,
					-
				-

						A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?

				-
					-
						Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Sudden at Hector’s side Apollo stood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 56: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Like Phaenops, Asius’ son, appear’d the god;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 57

					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 1

						“Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A chief once thought no terror of the field?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He bears victorious, while our army flies:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 7
				-
					-
						By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!”
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 9
				-
					-
						This heard, o’er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That shaded Ide and all the subject field
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Involved the mount; the thunder roar’d aloud;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 7
				-
					-
						At one regard of his all-seeing eye
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 58: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors fly.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 59
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For as the brave Boeotian turn’d his head
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And razed his shoulder with a shorten’d spear:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 5
				-
					-
						By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 59: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 60
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As Hector follow’d, Idomen address’d
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The flaming javelin to his manly breast;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The brittle point before his corslet yields;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 5
				-
					-
						High on his chariots the Cretan stood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The son of Priam whirl’d the massive wood.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 11
				-
					-
						On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And with his life his master’s safety bought.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The teeth it shatter’d, and the tongue it rent.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His dying hand forgets the falling rein:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 19
				-
					-
						This Merion reaches, bending from the car,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And urges to desert the hopeless war:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 60: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And the swift chariot to the navy flies.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 61
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 61: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Turn’d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To Atreus’s seed, the godlike Telamon:
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Alas! who sees not Jove’s almighty hand
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He suffers every lance to fall in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Deserted of the god, yet let us try
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What human strength and prudence can supply;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If yet this honour’d corse, in triumph borne,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 10
				-
					-
						May glad the fleets that hope not our return,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Some hero too must be despatch’d to bear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The mournful message to Pelides’ ear;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But such a chief I spy not through the host:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 19
				-
					-
						In general darkness—Lord of earth and air!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 23
				-
					-
						If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 62: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But let us perish in the face of day!”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 63
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The god relenting clear’d the clouded air;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The blaze of armour flash’d against the day.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 6
				-
					-
						If yet Antilochus survives the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Let him to great Achilles’ ear convey
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 63: Verse 8

						The fatal news”—Atrides hastes away.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 64
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So turns the lion from the nightly fold,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Long gall’d by herdsmen, and long vex’d by hounds,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the red terrors of the blazing brands:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So moved Atrides from his dangerous place
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The foe, he fear’d, might yet Patroclus gain,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 64: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And much admonish’d, much adjured his train:
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 65
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O guard these relics to your charge consign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And bear the merits of the dead in mind;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How skill’d he was in each obliging art;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He was, alas! but fate decreed his end,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 65: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In death a hero, as in life a friend!”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 66
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And round on all sides sent his piercing view.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of all that wings the mid aërial sky,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The sacred eagle, from his walks above
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not with less quickness, his exerted sight
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Pass’d this and that way, through the ranks of fight:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 66: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 67
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him the king: “Beloved of Jove! draw near,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For sadder tidings never touch’d thy ear;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy eyes have witness’d what a fatal turn!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 4
				-
					-
						How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He too may haste the naked corse to gain:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 67: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The arms are Hector’s, who despoil’d the slain.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 68
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 4
				-
					-
						What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then ran the mournful message to impart,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 68: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 69
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Though sore distress’d) to aid the Pylian bands;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);

					-
						But hope not, warriors, for Achilles’ aid:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Unarm’d, he fights not with the Trojan foe.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 69: Verse 9
				-
					-
						’Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,

						’Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,

					-
						And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate

					-
						With Merion’s aid, the weighty corse to rear;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Myself, and my bold brother will sustain
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The shock of Hector and his charging train:

					-
						What Troy can dare, we have already tried,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 7

						Have tried it, and have stood.” The hero said.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 8
				-
					-
						High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A general clamour rises at the sight:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Voracious hounds, that many a length before
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But if the savage turns his glaring eye,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 16
				-
					-
						They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 70: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus aloft the hero’s corse they bear,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Behind them rages all the storm of war:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Confusion, tumult, horror, o’er the throng
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To whelm some city under waves of fire;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The heroes sweat beneath their honour’d load:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 12
				-
					-
						As when two mules, along the rugged road,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 13
				-
					-
						From the steep mountain with exerted strength
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Drag some vast beam, or mast’s unwieldy length;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So these—Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thus when a river swell’d with sudden rains
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Spreads his broad waters o’er the level plains,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Some interposing hill the stream divides,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Still close they follow, close the rear engage;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Æneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 25
				-
					-
						While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 27
				-
					-
						That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 28
				-
					-
						High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 29
				-
					-
						So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Within, without the trench, and all the way,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Strow’d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Such horror Jove impress’d! yet still proceeds
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 71: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.

						Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Meanwhile, where Hellespont’s broad waters flow,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stood Nestor’s son, the messenger of woe:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On hoisted yards extended to the gales;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pensive he sat; for all that fate design’d
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus to his soul he said: “Ah! what constrains
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Is this the day, which heaven so long ago
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ordain’d, to sink me with the weight of woe?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(So Thetis warn’d;) when by a Trojan hand
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The bravest of the Myrmidonian band
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And warn’d to shun Hectorean force in vain!”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And tells the melancholy tale with tears.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 2: Verse 6

						His naked corse: his arms are Hector’s right.”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 3
			-

						A sudden horror shot through all the chief,

				-
					-
						And wrapp’d his senses in the cloud of grief;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-

						The scorching ashes o’er his graceful head;

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 5

						His purple garments, and his golden hairs,

						Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 7

						On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,

				-
					-
						(Won by his own, or by Patroclus’ arms,)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Rush’d from their tents with cries; and gathering round,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						While Nestor’s son sustains a manlier part,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And mourns the warrior with a warrior’s heart;

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 3: Verse 15

					-
						Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,

				-
					-
						The mother-goddess from her crystal throne
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 4: Verse 4

						Heard his loud cries, and answer’d groan for groan.

						Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),

						Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:

						Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,

						And the blue languish of soft Alia’s eye.

					-
						All these, and all that deep in ocean held
					-

					Book 18: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Till Thetis’ sorrows thus began to flow:

			-
				Book 18: Stanza 5
			-

				-
					-
						“Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!

					-
						How just a cause has Thetis to complain!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						How more than wretched in the immortal state!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The bravest far that ever bore the name;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Like some fair olive, by my careful hand
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He grew, he flourish’d and adorn’d the land!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He never, never must return again.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So short a space the light of heaven to view,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So short, alas! and fill’d with anguish too!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						I go at least to bear a tender part,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And mourn my loved-one with a mother’s heart.”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said, and left the caverns of the main,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						All bathed in tears; the melancholy train
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						While the long pomp the silver wave divides.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Approaching now, they touch’d the Trojan land;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The immortal mother, standing close beside
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And thus the silver-footed dame began:

			-
				Book 18: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why mourns my son? thy late preferr’d request
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The god has granted, and the Greeks distress’d:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-

						Reveal the cause, and trust a parent’s care.”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He, deeply groaning—“To this cureless grief,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Not even the Thunderer’s favour brings relief.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 3

					-
						Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;

				-
					-
						Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 7

						Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow’d

						On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.

						Cursed be that day, when all the powers above

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A mortal beauty to his equal bed!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 17

						For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.

						’Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;

					-
						Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Let me revenge it on proud Hector’s heart,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						On these conditions will I breathe: till then,

			-
				Book 18: Stanza 9
			-

						A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:

					-
						“Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 3

						When Hector falls, thou diest.”—“Let Hector die,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 6

						He fell, and falling, wish’d my aid in vain.

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Ah then, since from this miserable day
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 8

					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 10

						The fate of Hector from Achilles’ hand;

					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 11

						Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,

					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.

						’Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate.

					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-

						Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;

				-
					-
						Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The great Alcides, Jove’s unequall’d son,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						To Juno’s hate, at length resign’d his breath,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 29

						So shall Achilles fall! stretch’d pale and dead,

				-

						No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 31

					-
						Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And reap what glory life’s short harvest yields.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 33

				-
					-
						With frantic hands her long dishevell’d hair?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 35

						Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,

					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 9: Verse 37

						Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms—

					-
						In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—

						Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus’ body bore

				-
					-
						“Rise, son of Peleus! rise, divinely brave!

					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fall by mutual wounds around the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-

						To drag him back to Troy the foe contends:

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 8

					-
						And marks the place to fix his head on high.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 9

				-
					-
						“I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove,

						The immortal empress of the realms above;

					-
						The gallant chief defends Menoetius’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 14

			-
				Book 18: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 1

				-
					-
						Her aegis Pallas o’er his shoulder throws;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A stream of glory flamed above his head.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when from some beleaguer’d town arise

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 16

					-
						So high his brazen voice the hero rear’d:

					-
						Hosts dropp’d their arms, and trembled as they heard:

					-
						While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain

						Around, his sad companions melt in tears.

				-
					-
						Whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,

						He sent refulgent to the field of war;

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 19: Verse 8

						Stretch’d forth, and gash’d with many a gaping wound.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 1

						Meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,

				-
					-
						In ocean’s waves the unwilling light of day
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 3

					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 7

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						’Twas now no season for prolong’d debate;

						They saw Achilles, and in him their fate.

						Silent they stood: Polydamas at last,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 20: Verse 12

					-
						Skill’d to discern the future by the past,

				-
					-
						Not long continues to the shores confined,

					-
						Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray

						Contending nations won and lost the day;

						For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife,

						If but the morrow’s sun behold us here,

						That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;

					-
						And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,

					-
						Vouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 31: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The genial rites, and hospitable fare;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 31: Verse 21
				-
					-
						While I the labours of the forge forego,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 31: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And bid the roaring bellows cease to blow.”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And stills the bellows, and (in order laid)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Locks in their chests his instruments of trade.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then with a sponge the sooty workman dress’d
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His brawny arms embrown’d, and hairy breast.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Came halting forth the sovereign of the fire:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The monarch’s steps two female forms uphold,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That moved and breathed in animated gold;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To whom was voice, and sense, and science given
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						On these supported, with unequal gait,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He reach’d the throne where pensive Thetis sate;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There placed beside her on the shining frame,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He thus address’d the silver-footed dame:
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(So long a stranger) to these honour’d walls?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						’Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Vulcan’s joy and duty to obey.”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom the mournful mother thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So pierced with sorrows, so o’erwhelm’d as mine?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For Thetis only such a weight of care?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						I, only I, of all the watery race
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By force subjected to a man’s embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The mighty fine imposed on length of days.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The bravest sure that ever bore the name;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He grew, he flourish’d, and adorn’d the land!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To Troy I sent him! but his native shore
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Never, ah never, shall receive him more;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Robb’d of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The king of nations forced his royal slave:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress’d
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Required his arm, he sorrow’d unredress’d.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Large gifts they promise, and their elders send;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 24
				-
					-
						In vain—he arms not, but permits his friend
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 28
				-
					-
						At once resigns his armour, life, and fame.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And to the field in martial pomp restore,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 34: Verse 32
				-
					-
						To shine with glory, till he shines no more!”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To her the artist-god: “Thy griefs resign,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O could I hide him from the Fates, as well,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of wondering ages, and the world’s amaze!”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having said, the father of the fires
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To the black labours of his forge retires.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn’d
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And twenty forges catch at once the fires;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Just as the god directs, now loud, now low,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Before, deep fix’d, the eternal anvils stand;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The ponderous hammer loads his better hand,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His left with tongs turns the vex’d metal round,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then first he form’d the immense and solid shield;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Rich various artifice emblazed the field;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A silver chain suspends the massy round;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Five ample plates the broad expanse compose,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And godlike labours on the surface rose.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There shone the image of the master-mind:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The unwearied sun, the moon completely round;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The starry lights that heaven’s high convex crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And great Orion’s more refulgent beam;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To which, around the axle of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Two cities radiant on the shield appear,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The image one of peace, and one of war.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Along the street the new-made brides are led,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The youthful dancers in a circle bound
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To the soft flute, and cithern’s silver sound:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through the fair streets the matrons in a row
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						There in the forum swarm a numerous train;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The subject of debate, a townsman slain:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And bade the public and the laws decide:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The witness is produced on either hand:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For this, or that, the partial people stand:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The appointed heralds still the noisy bands,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On seats of stone, within the sacred place,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The reverend elders nodded o’er the case;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The prize of him who best adjudged the right.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Another part (a prospect differing far)
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Glow’d with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Two mighty hosts a leaguer’d town embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And one would pillage, one would burn the place.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meantime the townsmen, arm’d with silent care,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A secret ambush on the foe prepare:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Their wives, their children, and the watchful band
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And gold their armour: these the squadron led,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						August, divine, superior by the head!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Cover’d with shields, beside a silver flood.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Soon the white flocks proceeded o’er the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Behind them piping on their reeds they go,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In arms the glittering squadron rising round
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 26
				-
					-
						They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 27
				-
					-
						They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The waving silver seem’d to blush with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 29
				-
					-
						There Tumult, there Contention stood confess’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 30
				-
					-
						One rear’d a dagger at a captive’s breast;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 31
				-
					-
						One held a living foe, that freshly bled
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 32
				-
					-
						With new-made wounds; another dragg’d a dead;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Fate stalk’d amidst them, grim with human gore.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And the whole war came out, and met the eye;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 40: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And each bold figure seem’d to live or die.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						A field deep furrow’d next the god design’d,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The third time labour’d by the sweating hind;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The shining shares full many ploughmen guide,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And turn their crooked yokes on every side.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Still as at either end they wheel around,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The master meets them with his goblet crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll’d;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And sable look’d, though form’d of molten gold.
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Another field rose high with waving grain;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With bended sickles stand the reaper train:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here stretched in ranks the levell’d swarths are found,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Sheaves heap’d on sheaves here thicken up the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And last the children, in whose arms are borne
					-

						Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;

						Two lions rushing from the wood appear’d;

				-

					-
						And seized a bull, the master of the herd:

						He roar’d: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;

					-
						In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 3

						Form’d by Daedalean art; a comely band

						Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.

						The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:

						Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll’d;

					-
						Of these the sides adorn’d with swords of gold,

						That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.

						Now all at once they rise, at once descend,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Confusedly regular, the moving maze:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And undistinguish’d blend the flying ring:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The gazing multitudes admire around:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Two active tumblers in the centre bound;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 46: Verse 20

						And general songs the sprightly revel end.

						Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown’d

					-
						With his last hand, and pour’d the ocean round:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In living silver seem’d the waves to roll,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 47: Verse 4

						And beat the buckler’s verge, and bound the whole.

						This done, whate’er a warrior’s use requires

						He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress’d
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With various sculpture, and the golden crest.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At Thetis’ feet the finished labour lay:

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Swift from Olympus’ snowy summit flies,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 48: Verse 8

						And bears the blazing present through the skies.

						Above the waves, that blush’d with early red,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,

						The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears

						Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears

						Stretch’d o’er Patroclus’ corse; while all the rest

						Their sovereign’s sorrows in their own express’d.

						A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,

						And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:

			-
				Book 19: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know

					-
						It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 2: Verse 3

						Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow’d,

					-
						Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,

						Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,

						The world’s great ruler, felt her venom’d dart;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Deceived by Juno’s wiles, and female art:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For when Alcmena’s nine long months were run,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And Jove expected his immortal son,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To gods and goddesses the unruly joy
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He show’d, and vaunted of his matchless boy:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						‘From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.’
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Saturnia ask’d an oath, to vouch the truth,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And fix dominion on the favour’d youth.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The joyful goddess, from Olympus’ height,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus’s wife;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						She push’d her lingering infant into life:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Her charms Alcmena’s coming labours stay,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						‘A youth (said she) of Jove’s immortal kind
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And claims thy promise to be king of kings.’
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Stung to the soul, he sorrow’d, and he raged.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						From his ambrosial head, where perch’d she sate,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						He snatch’d the fury-goddess of debate,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The immortal seats should ne’er behold her more;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And whirl’d her headlong down, for ever driven
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Thence on the nether world the fury fell;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Ordain’d with man’s contentious race to dwell.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Full oft the god his son’s hard toils bemoan’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan’d.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						While raging Hector heap’d our camps with dead.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 9: Verse 57

						For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!

				-
					-
						The black-eyed maid inviolate removes,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Pure and unconscious of my manly loves.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And levell’d thunder strike my guilty head!”
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The sacred herald rolls the victim slain
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 17: Verse 4

						(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus Achilles: “Hear, ye Greeks! and know
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whate’er we feel, ’tis Jove inflicts the woe;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not else Atrides could our rage inflame,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						’Twas Jove’s high will alone, o’erruling all,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That doom’d our strife, and doom’d the Greeks to fall.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight.”
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The speedy council at his word adjourn’d:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To their black vessels all the Greeks return’d.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Achilles sought his tent. His train before
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						March’d onward, bending with the gifts they bore.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To their new seats the female captives move.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Briseis, radiant as the queen of love,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Slow as she pass’d, beheld with sad survey
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Where, gash’d with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Once tender friend of my distracted mind!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What woes my wretched race of life attend!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sorrows on sorrows, never doom’d to end!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The first loved consort of my virgin bed
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						My three brave brothers in one mournful day
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						All trod the dark, irremeable way:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thy friendly hand uprear’d me from the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Achilles’ care you promised I should prove,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The first, the dearest partner of his love;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						That rites divine should ratify the band,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And make me empress in his native land.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For thee, that ever felt another’s woe!”
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor mourn’d Patroclus’ fortunes, but their own.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The leaders press’d the chief on every side;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care

				-
					-
						Is bent to please him, this request forbear;
					-
				-

					-
						Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 22: Verse 4

					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and from the warriors turn’d his face:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus’ race.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.

						“Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)

				-
					-
						Thy sweet society, thy winning care,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 4

					-
						Once stay’d Achilles, rushing to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But now, alas! to death’s cold arms resign’d,
					-
				-

					-
						What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His son’s sad fate, and drops a tender tear.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						My only offspring, sink into the grave?
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fate claim’d Achilles, but might spare his friend.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						My tender orphan with a parent’s care,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 19
				-
					-
						From Scyros’ isle conduct him o’er the main,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 20

					-
						And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The lofty palace, and the large domain.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 22

						For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Or drags a wretched life of age and care,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 24

					-
						But till the news of my sad fate invades
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 24: Verse 25

			-
				Book 19: Stanza 25
			-

					Book 19: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join’d,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each stole a tear for what he left behind.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:

			-
				Book 19: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Is then Achilles now no more thy care,

						And dost thou thus desert the great in war?
					-

						Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 26: Verse 6

						Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.”
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 27
			-

					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shot the descending goddess from above.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The wide air floating to her ample wings,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To great Achilles she her flight address’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pour’d divine ambrosia in his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-

						Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And like a deluge pour’d upon the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And scatter o’er the fields the driving snow;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 12

						With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 1

						Full in the midst, high-towering o’er the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress’d;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Arms which the father of the fire bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						O’erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.

						The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then o’er his breast was braced the hollow gold;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The brazen sword a various baldric tied,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That, starr’d with gems, hung glittering at his side;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Blazed with long rays, and gleam’d athwart the field.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 1

						So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the watery waste, a light appears,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Loud howls the storm, and drives them o’er the main.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Like the red star, that from his flaming hair
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So stream’d the golden honours from his head,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His arms he poises, and his motions tries;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Buoy’d by some inward force, he seems to swim,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now he shakes his great paternal spear,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From Pelion’s cloudy top an ash entire
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Old Chiron fell’d, and shaped it for his sire;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A spear which stern Achilles only wields,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.

				-
					-
						(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The ivory-studded reins, return’d behind,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Waved o’er their backs, and to the chariot join’d.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The charioteer then whirl’d the lash around,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And swift ascended at one active bound.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-

						Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;

				-
					-
						Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.

						But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through the thick troops the embolden’d hero press’d:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His venturous act the white-arm’d queen survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,

						Lo great Æneas rushing to the war!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Against Pelides he directs his course,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 4

					-
						Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.

						Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Our favour’d hero, let some power descend.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To guard his life, and add to his renown,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						We, the great armament of heaven, came down.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That spun so short his life’s illustrious line:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But lest some adverse god now cross his way,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Give him to know what powers assist this day:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 14

						When heaven’s refulgent host appear in arms?”

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 1

					-
						Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The solid globe’s eternal basis shake:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Against the might of man, so feeble known,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Why should celestial powers exert their own?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And leave to war the fates of mortal men.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But if the armipotent, or god of light,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And these, in ruin and confusion hurl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Yield to our conquering arms the lower world.”

						Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Advanced upon the field there stood a mound
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of earth congested, wall’d, and trench’d around;

						(The work of Trojans, with Minerva’s aid,)

						What time a vengeful monster of the main
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-

						Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.

					-
						Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,

					-
						With clouds encompass’d, and a veil of air:

				-
					-
						The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In circle close each heavenly party sat,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Intent to form the future scheme of fate;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-

						Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.

						Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;

					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With towering strides Æneas first advanced;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Spread o’er his breast the fencing shield he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not so Pelides; furious to engage,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He rush’d impetuous. Such the lion’s rage,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Though all in arms the peopled city rise,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To his bold spear the savage turns alone,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Lash’d by his tail his heaving sides resound;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						So stands Æneas, and his force defies.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ere yet the stern encounter join’d, begun

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 17: Verse 26

					-
						The seed of Thetis thus to Venus’ son:

				-
					-
						“Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Seeks he to meet Achilles’ arm in war,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The partial monarch may refuse the prize;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And ’tis his fault to love those sons too well,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						An ample forest, or a fair domain,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But can Achilles be so soon forgot?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Once (as I think) you saw this brandish’d spear,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And then the great Æneas seem’d to fear:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						With hearty haste from Ida’s mount he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor, till he reach’d Lyrnessus, turn’d his head.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Her lofty walls not long our progress stay’d;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						’Tis true, the great Æneas fled too fast.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 18: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Defrauded of my conquest once before,

					-
						What then I lost, the gods this day restore.
					-
				-

						Go; while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;

						Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.”

						To this Anchises’ son: “Such words employ

						To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;

						From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:

				-
					-
						Dardania’s walls he raised; for Ilion, then,
					-

				-
					-
						(The city since of many-languaged men,)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Was not. The natives were content to till

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The shady foot of Ida’s fountful hill.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The richest, once, of Asia’s wealthy kings;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Boreas, enamour’d of the sprightly train,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Conceal’d his godhead in a flowing mane,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And coursed the dappled beauties o’er the mead:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall’d kind,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.

						These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,

				-
					-
						Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;

						And when along the level seas they flew,

					-
						Scarce on the surface curl’d the briny dew.

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 35

					-
						The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.

						Three sons renown’d adorn’d his nuptial bed,

						Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:

						The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Whom heaven, enamour’d, snatch’d to upper air,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 41
				-
					-
						To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,

					-
						The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).
					-
				-

					-
						The two remaining sons the line divide:

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 44
				-
					-
						First rose Laomedon from Ilus’ side;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 45
				-
					-
						From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And Priam, bless’d with Hector, brave and bold;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour’d pair;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 49
				-
					-
						From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Such is our race: ’tis fortune gives us birth,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 53
				-
					-
						He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 54
				-
					-
						All human courage gives, or takes away.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 55

						Long in the field of words we may contend,

				-
					-
						Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Arm’d or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 58
				-
					-
						So voluble a weapon is the tongue;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 60
				-
					-
						For every man has equal strength to rail:

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Women alone, when in the streets they jar,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Like us they stand, encompass’d with the crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 64

					-
						And vent their anger impotent and loud.

				-
					-
						Cease then—Our business in the field of fight
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 19: Verse 66

						Is not to question, but to prove our might.

						He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fix’d deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Far on his outstretch’d arm, Pelides held
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His fears were vain; impenetrable charms
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through two strong plates the point its passage held,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But stopp’d, and rested, by the third repell’d.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Five plates of various metal, various mould,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And pierced the Dardan shield’s extremest bound,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Where the shrill brass return’d a sharper sound:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And the slight covering of expanded hides.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Æneas his contracted body bends,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And o’er him high the riven targe extends,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And at his back perceives the quivering spear:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And swims before his eyes the many-colour’d light.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Draws his broad blade, and at Æneas flies:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Æneas rousing as the foe came on,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 30
				-
					-
						A mass enormous! which in modern days
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 31
				-
					-
						No two of earth’s degenerate sons could raise.

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 32
				-
					-
						But ocean’s god, whose earthquakes rock the ground
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 20: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lo! on the brink of fate Æneas stands,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						An instant victim to Achilles’ hands;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow’d
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His aid in vain: the man o’erpowers the god.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And can ye see this righteous chief atone
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With guiltless blood for vices not his own?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To all the gods his constant vows were paid;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 8

					-
						Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.

						Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign

						The future father of the Dardan line:

				-
					-
						The first great ancestor obtain’d his grace,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And still his love descends on all the race:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For Priam now, and Priam’s faithless kind,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						On great Æneas shall devolve the reign,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 21: Verse 16

						And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.”

						Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,

					-
						Swift interposed between the warrior flies,

					-
						And at his master’s feet the weapon threw.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						That done, with force divine he snatch’d on high
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:

				-

				-
					-
						Till at the battle’s utmost verge they light,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.

				-
					-
						The godhead there (his heavenly form confess’d)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 23: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With words like these the panting chief address’d:

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What power, O prince! with force inferior far,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Urged thee to meet Achilles’ arm in war?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But when the day decreed (for come it must)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Let then the furies of that arm be known,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, he left him wondering as he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then from Achilles chased the mist away:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sudden, returning with a stream of light,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The scene of war came rushing on his sight.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then thus, amazed; “What wonders strike my mind!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That fell this instant, vanish’d from my sword!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						I thought alone with mortals to contend,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But powers celestial sure this foe defend.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now then let others bleed.” This said, aloud
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						“O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						’Tis not in me, though favour’d by the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						No god can singly such a host engage,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva’s rage.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But whatsoe’er Achilles can inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Whate’er of active force, or acting fire;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Whate’er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And thin the squadrons with my single spear.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: nor less elate with martial joy,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The godlike Hector warm’d the troops of Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus’ haughty son.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Deeds must decide our fate. E’en these with words
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A wood of lances rises round his head,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The single fight with Thetis’ godlike son;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						More safe to combat in the mingled band,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He hears, obedient to the god of light,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On Troy’s whole force with boundless fury flies.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						First falls Iphytion, at his army’s head;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His mother was a Nais, of the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown’d with snow,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From Hyde’s walls he ruled the lands below.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The parted visage falls on equal sides:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						While thus Achilles glories o’er the slain:
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Those beauteous fields where Hyllus’ waves are roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Are thine no more.”—The insulting hero said,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And left him sleeping in eternal shade.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 29: Verse 8

					-
						And dash’d their axles with no vulgar gore.

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 30

						Demoleon next, Antenor’s offspring, laid

				-
					-
						Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The impatient steel with full-descending sway
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Resistless drove the batter’d skull before,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And dash’d and mingled all the brains with gore.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He groans away his soul: not louder roars,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						At Neptune’s shrine on Helice’s high shores,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,

				-
					-
						And ocean listens to the grateful sound.

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 15

						Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The youngest hope of Priam’s stooping age:

				-
					-
						(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass’d:)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To the forbidden field he takes his flight,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In the first folly of a youthful knight,

						To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And golden rings the double back-plate join’d
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The rushing entrails pour’d upon the ground
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 28
				-
					-
						His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When Hector view’d, all ghastly in his gore,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 31
				-
					-
						A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His soul no longer brook’d the distant fight:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Full in Achilles’ dreadful front he came,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And shook his javelin like a waving flame.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 37
				-
					-
						“And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 39
				-
					-
						No more shall Hector’s and Pelides’ spear
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Turn from each other in the walks of war.”—
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Then with revengeful eyes he scann’d him o’er:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 30: Verse 42
				-
					-
						“Come, and receive thy fate!” He spake no more.
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Hector, undaunted, thus: “Such words employ
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Such we could give, defying and defied,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						I know thy force to mine superior far;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But heaven alone confers success in war:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And give it entrance in a braver heart.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then parts the lance: but Pallas’ heavenly breath
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The bidden dart again to Hector flies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And at the feet of its great master lies.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Achilles closes with his hated foe,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The favour’d hero in a veil of clouds.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Wretch! thou hast ’scaped again; once more thy flight
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						If any power assist Achilles’ hand.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And stopp’d Demuchus, great Philetor’s heir.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Gigantic chief! deep gash’d the enormous blade,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And for the soul an ample passage made.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Laoganus and Dardanus expire,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Both in one instant from the chariot hurl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Sunk in one instant to the nether world:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This difference only their sad fates afford
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						That one the spear destroy’d, and one the sword.
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant’s moan,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To spare a form, an age so like thy own!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						E’er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The panting liver pours a flood of gore
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Through Mulius’ head then drove the impetuous spear:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The warrior falls, transfix’d from ear to ear.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Warm’d in the brain the smoking weapon lies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The purple death comes floating o’er his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He dropp’d his arm, an unassisting weight,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And stood all impotent, expecting fate:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From his broad shoulders hew’d his crested head:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The squire, who saw expiring on the ground
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His prostrate master, rein’d the steeds around;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His back, scarce turn’d, the Pelian javelin gored,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And stretch’d the servant o’er his dying lord.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 23
				-
					-
						As when a flame the winding valley fills,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then o’er the stubble up the mountain flies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 28
				-
					-
						So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Around him wide, immense destruction pours
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 31
				-
					-
						As with autumnal harvests cover’d o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres’ sacred floor;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 33
				-
					-
						When round and round, with never-wearied pain,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The trampling steers beat out the unnumber’d grain:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 35
				-
					-
						So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes’ souls,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Dash’d from their hoofs while o’er the dead they fly,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And thick the groaning axles dropp’d with gore.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 41
				-
					-
						High o’er the scene of death Achilles stood,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 42
				-
					-
						All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Such is the lust of never-dying fame!

				-
					-
						Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 3

						The river here divides the flying train,

					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 4

					-
						Part to the town fly diverse o’er the plain,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 6

						Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:

					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,

						And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)

					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The flashing billows beat the whiten’d shores:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 14

						As the scorch’d locusts from their fields retire,

				-
					-
						While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The clustering legions rush into the flood:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles’ force,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His bloody lance the hero casts aside,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Arm’d with his sword, high brandish’d o’er the waves:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Deep groan’d the waters with the dying sound;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,

						And the warm purple circled on the tide.

				-
					-
						Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 29

					-
						And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 30

						So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,

						Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						With their rich belts their captive arms restrains

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 37

					-
						(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 1: Verse 38

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 2

					-
						The young Lycaon in his passage stood;

						The son of Priam; whom the hero’s hand

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 5

					-
						(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel

					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lopp’d the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To Lemnos’ isle he sold the royal slave,

						The ransom’d prince to fair Arisbe bore.

					-
						Ten days were past, since in his father’s reign

						He felt the sweets of liberty again;

						The next, that god whom men in vain withstand

						Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand

					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 15

				-
					-
						A sadder journey to the shades below.

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 17

						(The helm and visor he had cast aside
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With wild affright, and dropp’d upon the field
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His useless lance and unavailing shield,)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And knock’d his faltering knees, the hero said:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						“Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						As now the captive, whom so late I bound
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Not him the sea’s unmeasured deeps detain,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						That bar such numbers from their native plain;

				Book 21: Stanza 3
			-

					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 1

						Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Approach’d, and sought his knees with suppliant tears

					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He kiss’d his feet, extended on the ground:

				-
					-
						And while, above, the spear suspended stood,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 9

					-
						One hand embraced them close, one stopp’d the dart,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						While thus these melting words attempt his heart:

						“Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,

						(Old Altes’ daughter, and Lelegia’s heir;

						The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:

					-
						Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display’d,
					-
				-

						The victor to the stream the carcase gave,

						“Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround

						Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:

					-
						Thus is atoned Patroclus’ honour’d shade,

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 7
			-

						With fury swells the violated flood.

				-
					-
						The great Asteropeus to mortal war;

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 7

					-
						The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line

						(Fair Peribaea’s love the god had crown’d,

				-
					-
						With all his refluent waters circled round:)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						On him Achilles rush’d; he fearless stood,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The flood impell’d him, on Pelides’ head
					-
				-

						To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.

					-
						(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?
					-

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 4

					-
						One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;

					-
						One razed Achilles’ hand; the spouting blood

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Spun forth; in earth the fasten’d weapon stood.

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Its erring fury hiss’d along the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,

				-

					-
						Even to the middle earth; and quiver’d there.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 11

					-
						Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And on his foe with double fury flew.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The foe thrice tugg’d, and shook the rooted wood;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:

						The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 16

					-
						Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;

					-
						His belly open’d with a ghastly wound,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 18

					-
						The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 19

					-
						Beneath the hero’s feet he panting lies,

				-
					-
						The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 12
			-

					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,

				-
					-
						And left the breathless warrior in his gore.

					-
						Till, roll’d between the banks, it lies the food

						But from the bottom of his gulfs profound

				-
					-
						Scamander spoke; the shores return’d the sound.

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In valour matchless, and in force divine!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 3

					-
						If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,

					-
						’Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 5

						See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,

				-
					-
						Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 8

						Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						In human form, confess’d before his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The river thus; and thus the chief replies:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not till within her towers the perjured train
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said; and drove with fury on the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then to the godhead of the silver bow
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The yellow flood began: “O son of Jove!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Was not the mandate of the sire above
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full and express, that Phoebus should employ
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And make her conquer, till Hyperion’s fall

					-
						In awful darkness hide the face of all?”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke in vain—The chief without dismay
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then rising in his rage above the shores,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From all his deep the bellowing river roars,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss’d.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While all before, the billows ranged on high,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The falling deluge whelms the hero round:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Heaving the bank, and undermining all;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Leap’d from the channel, and regain’d the land.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then blacken’d the wild waves: the murmur rose:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The god pursues, a huger billow throws,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 27
				-
					-
						He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 28
				-
					-
						(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 30
				-
					-
						At every bound his clanging armour rings:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, he turns on every side,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And winds his course before the following tide;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The waves flow after, wheresoe’er he wheels,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 35
				-
					-
						So when a peasant to his garden brings
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Soon as he clears whate’er their passage stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And marks the future current with his spade,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Swift o’er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Louder and louder purl the falling rills;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And shine in mazy wanderings o’er the plains.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Still swift Scamander rolls where’er he flies:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The first of men, but not a match for gods.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oft as he turn’d the torrent to oppose,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And bravely try if all the powers were foes;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And still indignant bounds above the waves.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Wash’d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When thus (his eyes on heaven’s expansion thrown)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Is there no god Achilles to befriend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						No power to avert his miserable end?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And make my future life the sport of fate.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of all heaven’s oracles believed in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But most of Thetis must her son complain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						By Phoebus’ darts she prophesied my fall,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Stretch’d like a hero, by a hero’s arm!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Might Hector’s spear this dauntless bosom rend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And my swift soul o’ertake my slaughter’d friend.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						An unregarded carcase to the sea.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thus in human form address’d the chief:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The power of ocean first: “Forbear thy fear,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						’Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And Hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thine is the glory doom’d.” Thus spake the gods:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He springs impetuous, and invades the field:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O’er all the expanded plain the waters spread;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Floating ’midst scatter’d arms; while casques of gold
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d as they roll’d.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						High o’er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not a whole river stops the hero’s course,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						While Pallas fills him with immortal force.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And lifts his billows, and o’erwhelms his shores.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus to Simois! “Haste, my brother flood;

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And check this mortal that controls a god;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 3

						Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,

						From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,

					-
						With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,

					-
						Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 12

					-
						Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Whelm’d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Immersed remain this terror of the world.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						No Greeks shall e’er his perish’d relics grace,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 22

				-
					-
						Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.

						Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,

						And a foam whitens on the purple waves:

				-
					-
						At every step, before Achilles stood
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 6

					-
						The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fear touch’d the queen of heaven: she saw dismay’d,

						She call’d aloud, and summon’d Vulcan’s aid.

				-
					-
						The power ignipotent her word obeys:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And instant blows the water’d gardens dry:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So look’d the field, so whiten’d was the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Along the margin winds the running blaze:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The watery willows hiss before the fire.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 19
				-
					-
						At length the river rear’d his languid head,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						I faint, I sink, unequal to the fight—
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I yield—Let Ilion fall; if fate decree—
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ah—bend no more thy fiery arms on me!”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So boils the imprison’d flood, forbid to flow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To Juno then, imperial queen of air,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The burning river sends his earnest prayer:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On other gods his dreadful arm employ,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Submissive I desist, if thou command;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And in one ruin sink the Trojan name.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His warm entreaty touch’d Saturnia’s ear:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Again the branching streams begin to spread,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While these by Juno’s will the strife resign,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The warring gods in fierce contention join:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And views contending gods with careless eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And first assaults the radiant queen of war:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What moved thy madness, thus to disunite
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thy impious hand Tydides’ javelin bore,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And madly bathed it in celestial gore.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which bears Jove’s thunder on its dreadful field:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The adamantine aegis of her sire,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There fix’d from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						This at the heavenly homicide she cast.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And seven broad acres covers as he lies.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Loud o’er the fields his ringing arms resound:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						How far Minerva’s force transcends thy own?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas’ hand;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And partial aid to Troy’s perfidious race.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The goddess spoke, and turn’d her eyes away,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Jove’s Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, propp’d on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This the bright empress of the heavens survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And, scoffing, thus to war’s victorious maid:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Lo! what an aid on Mars’s side is seen!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The smiles’ and loves’ unconquerable queen!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Mark with what insolence, in open view,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Minerva smiling heard, the pair o’ertook,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On earth together lay the lovers spread.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“And like these heroes be the fate of all
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved.”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The god of ocean dares the god of light.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“What sloth has seized us, when the fields around
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No deed perform’d, to our Olympian sire?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Suits not my greatness, or superior age:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And guard the race of proud Laomedon!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch’s prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						We shared the lengthen’d labours of a year?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Troy walls I raised (for such were Jove’s commands),
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Along fair Ida’s vales and pendant groves.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But when the circling seasons in their train
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Brought back the grateful day that crown’d our pain,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With menace stern the fraudful king defied
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Mad as he was, he threaten’d servile bands,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And doom’d us exiles far in barbarous lands.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And destined vengeance on the perjured king.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And not, like us, infest the faithless race;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Like us, their present, future sons destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Apollo thus: “To combat for mankind

				-
					-
						Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;

				-
					-
						They owe their life and nourishment to earth;

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 5

					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And from the senior power submiss retires:

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 3

					-
						Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 4

				-
					-
						“And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,

					-
						And yields to ocean’s hoary sire the prize?

					Book 21: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 40: Verse 6

						Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power.”

				-
					-
						Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:

				-

					-
						But furious thus: “What insolence has driven

					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?

						Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,

						Learn hence, no more unequal war to wage—”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						These in her left hand lock’d, her right untied
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 17
				-
					-
						About her temples flies the busy bow;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 23
				-
					-
						So, when the falcon wings her way above,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 24
				-
					-
						To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 25
				-
					-
						(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 41: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Yet still her heart against the marble beats.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To her Latona hastes with tender care;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“How shall I face the dame, who gives delight
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke; and pass’d: Latona, stooping low,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Collects the scatter’d shafts and fallen bow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Dishonour’d relics of Diana’s war:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Weeping, she grasp’d his knees: the ambrosial vest
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The sire superior smiled, and bade her show
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What heavenly hand had caused his daughter’s woe?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Abash’d, she names his own imperial spouse;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Apollo enters Ilion’s sacred town;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fear’d the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Back to Olympus, from the war’s alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Return the shining bands of gods in arms;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O’er slaughter’d heroes, and o’er rolling steeds.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when avenging flames with fury driven
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the red vapours purple all the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And toils, and terrors, fill’d the dreadful day.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						High on a turret hoary Priam stands,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And marks the waste of his destructive hands;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Views, from his arm, the Trojans’ scatter’d flight,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the near hero rising on his sight!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And settled sorrow on his aged face,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And thus descending, on the guards he calls:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“You to whose care our city-gates belong,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Set wide your portals to the flying throng:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He comes, and desolation marks his way!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But when within the walls our troops take breath,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Phoebus rush’d forth, the flying bands to meet;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Struck slaughter back, and cover’d the retreat,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And gladsome see their last escape from fate.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thither, all parch’d with thirst, a heartless train,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 48: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To young Agenor force divine he gave;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Antenor’s offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And wrapt in clouds, restrain’d the hand of fate.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When now the generous youth Achilles spies,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 49: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Like others fly, and be like others slain?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yon line of slaughter’d Trojans lately trod.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						No: with the common heap I scorn to fall—
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						What if they pass’d me to the Trojan wall,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While I decline to yonder path, that leads
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To Ida’s forests and surrounding shades?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So may I reach, conceal’d, the cooling flood,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 11
				-
					-
						As soon as night her dusky veil extends,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Return in safety to my Trojan friends.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What if?—But wherefore all this vain debate?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Such is his swiftness, ’tis in vain to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And such his valour, that who stands must die.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Howe’er ’tis better, fighting for the state,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 23
				-
					-
						One only soul informs that dreadful frame:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 50: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And Jove’s sole favour gives him all his fame.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and stood, collected, in his might;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And all his beating bosom claim’d the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the barb’d javelin stings his breast in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not less resolved, Antenor’s valiant heir
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Disdainful of retreat: high held before,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 51: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“How proud Achilles glories in his fame!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Parents and children our just arms employ,

					-
						And strong and many are the sons of Troy.

					-
						Great as thou art, even thou may’st stain with gore
					-
				-

					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said: with matchless force the javelin flung
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dismiss’d with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Assumes Agenor’s habit, voice and shape,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The furious chief still follows where he flies.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now o’er the fields they stretch with lengthen’d strides,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The god, now distant scarce a stride before,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While all the flying troops their speed employ,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 21
				-
					-
						No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Who ’scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 23
				-
					-
						’Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And sudden joy confused, and mix’d affright.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 53: Verse 25
				-

						Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:

						There fix’d he stood before the Scaean gate;

				-
					-
						Still his bold arms determined to employ,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 12

					-
						The guardian still of long-defended Troy.

			-
				Book 22: Stanza 2

						Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:

					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The power confess’d in all his glory burns:)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“And what (he cries) has Peleus’ son in view,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For not to thee to know the gods is given,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Unskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 10

				Book 22: Stanza 3

				-
					-
						The chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To check my conquests in the middle way:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How few in Ilion else had refuge found!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 4

						What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 5

					-
						Thou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To cheat a mortal who repines in vain.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then to the city, terrible and strong,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With high and haughty steps he tower’d along,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So the proud courser, victor of the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To the near goal with double ardour flies.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Him, as he blazing shot across the field,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Orion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Terrific glory! for his burning breath
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						He lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The son, resolved Achilles’ force to dare,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While the sad father on the rampart stands,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And thus adjures him with extended hands:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;

				-
					-
						Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Methinks already I behold thee slain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Implacable Achilles! might’st thou be
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To all the gods no dearer than to me!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						How many valiant sons I late enjoy’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy’d:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						(Their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Consign’d his daughter with Lelegia’s throne:)
					-
				-

					-
						But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,

				-
					-
						All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						What sorrows then must their sad mother know,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						What anguish I? unutterable woe!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-

						Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 30

						Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 32

				-
					-
						(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 34

					-
						Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And number all his days by miseries!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 38

					-
						My heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						My daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						My bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						The last sad relic of my ruin’d state,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And stain the pavement of my regal hall;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Where famish’d dogs, late guardians of my door,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Shall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! ’tis well;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Well have they perish’d, for in fight they fell.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						In dust the reverend lineaments deform,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						This, this is misery! the last, the worse,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and acting what no words could say,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Rent from his head the silver locks away.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 3

						With him the mournful mother bears a part;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Have mercy on me, O my son! revere
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If ever thee in these fond arms I press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Against his rage if singly thou proceed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Should’st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far from our pious rites those dear remains
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Must feast the vultures on the naked plains.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Expects the hero’s terrible advance.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beholds the traveller approach the brake;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Have gather’d half the poisons of the plains;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:

				Book 22: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?

						Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:

					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shall proud Polydamas before the gate
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Proclaim, his counsels are obey’d too late,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Which timely follow’d but the former night,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						What numbers had been saved by Hector’s flight?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						That wise advice rejected with disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						I feel my folly in my people slain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Methinks my suffering country’s voice I hear,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But most her worthless sons insult my ear,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						On my rash courage charge the chance of war,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 12

					-
						And blame those virtues which they cannot share.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						No—if I e’er return, return I must
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Glorious, my country’s terror laid in dust:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or if I perish, let her see me fall
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In field at least, and fighting for her wall.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And yet suppose these measures I forego,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Approach unarm’d, and parley with the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And treat on terms of peace to save the town:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain’d
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With honourable justice to restore:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And add half Ilion’s yet remaining store,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						But why this thought? Unarm’d if I should go,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						We greet not here, as man conversing man,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Met at an oak, or journeying o’er a plain;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						No season now for calm familiar talk,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 33

					-
						Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:

					-
						War is our business, but to whom is given
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 35

						To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 10
			-

				-
					-
						Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shot trembling rays that glitter’d o’er the land;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Like Jove’s own lightning, or the rising sun.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.

				-

						He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:

					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Achilles follows like the winged wind.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						One urged by fury, one by fear impell’d:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now circling round the walls their course maintain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Next by Scamander’s double source they bound,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						With exhalations steaming to the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						That the green banks in summer’s heat o’erflows,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Whose polish’d bed receives the falling rills;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm’d by Greece)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Wash’d their fair garments in the days of peace.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						By these they pass’d, one chasing, one in flight:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 36
				-
					-
						No vulgar victim must reward the day:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 37
				-
					-
						(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The prize contended was great Hector’s life.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 39
				-
					-
						As when some hero’s funerals are decreed
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 40
				-
					-
						In grateful honour of the mighty dead;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 42
				-
					-
						(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 43
				-
					-
						The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And with them turns the raised spectator’s soul:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 47
				-
					-
						To whom, while eager on the chase they look,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						My heart partakes the generous Hector’s pain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From Ida’s summits, and the towers of Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now see him flying; to his fears resign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Consult, ye powers! (’tis worthy your debate)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whether to snatch him from impending fate,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Pallas thus: “Shall he whose vengeance forms
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shall he prolong one Trojan’s forfeit breath?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A man, a mortal, pre-ordain’d to death!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And will no murmurs fill the courts above?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Go then (return’d the sire) without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way.”
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As through the forest, o’er the vale and lawn,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The well-breath’d beagle drives the flying fawn,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The certain hound his various maze pursues.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus step by step, where’er the Trojan wheel’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						There swift Achilles compass’d round the field.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						What god, O muse, assisted Hector’s force
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With fate itself so long to hold the course?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And great Achilles, lest some Greek’s advance
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Sign’d to the troops to yield his foe the way,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And leave untouch’d the honours of the day.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Jove lifts the golden balances, that show
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The fates of mortal men, and things below:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here each contending hero’s lot he tries,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector’s fate;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						See, where in vain he supplicates above,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Roll’d at the feet of unrelenting Jove;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.”

					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Obey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While like Deiphobus the martial dame
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),
					-
				-

				-
					-
						In show an aid, by hapless Hector’s side
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Approach’d, and greets him thus with voice belied:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Of this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						It fits us now a noble stand to make,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then he: “O prince! allied in blood and fame,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dearer than all that own a brother’s name;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Since you, of all our numerous race alone
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Defend my life, regardless of your own.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Again the goddess: “Much my father’s prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,

				-
					-
						Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:

						Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.

					-
						Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,

						And for a moment’s space suspend the day;

						He spoke, and launch’d his javelin at the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But Hector shunn’d the meditated blow:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He stoop’d, while o’er his head the flying spear
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Minerva watch’d it falling on the land,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then drew, and gave to great Achilles’ hand,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 26
			-

					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“The life you boasted to that javelin given,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Prince! you have miss’d. My fate depends on Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And with false terrors sink another’s mind.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 7

						But know, whatever fate I am to try,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-

						I shall not fall a fugitive at least,
					-

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-

						The weapon flew, its course unerring held,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell’d
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The mortal dart; resulting with a bound
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear—
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						“’Tis so—Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						I deem’d Deiphobus had heard my call,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						But he secure lies guarded in the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						A god deceived me; Pallas, ’twas thy deed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Death and black fate approach! ’tis I must bleed.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						No refuge now, no succour from above,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 18

						’Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:

					-
						Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,

						Let future ages hear it, and admire!”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, all collected, on Achilles flew.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So Jove’s bold bird, high balanced in the air,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And as he moved, his figure seem’d on flame.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Far-beaming o’er the silver host of night,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						So shone the point of great Achilles’ spear.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In his right hand he waves the weapon round,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Securely cased the warrior’s body o’er.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 19
				-
					-
						One space at length he spies, to let in fate,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Where ’twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Gave entrance: through that penetrable part
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Furious he drove the well-directed dart:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 26
				-
					-
						While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“At last is Hector stretch’d upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who fear’d no vengeance for Patroclus slain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then, prince! you should have fear’d, what now you feel;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Achilles absent was Achilles still:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For ever honour’d, and for ever mourn’d:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While cast to all the rage of hostile power,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The common rites of sepulture bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To soothe a father’s and a mother’s woe:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And Hector’s ashes in his country rest.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Could I myself the bloody banquet join!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And giving thousands, offer thousands more;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Their Hector on the pile they should not see,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The Furies that relentless breast have steel’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Yet think, a day will come, when fate’s decree
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He ceased. The Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And his eyes stiffen’d at the hand of death;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(The manly body left a load of clay,)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Achilles, musing as he roll’d his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O’er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I follow thee”—He said, and stripp’d the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then forcing backward from the gaping wound
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His manly beauty and superior size;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While some, ignobler, the great dead deface
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter’d fate!”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						High o’er the slain the great Achilles stands,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And thus aloud, while all the host attends:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Since now at length the powerful will of heaven
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The dire destroyer to our arm has given,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						See, if already their deserted towers
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Are left unmann’d; or if they yet retain
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But what is Troy, or glory what to me?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal’d his eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Unwept, unhonour’d, uninterr’d he lies!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Can his dear image from my soul depart,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 17
				-
					-
						If in the melancholy shades below,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Burn on through death, and animate my shade.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Meanwhile, ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The corpse of Hector, and your paeans sing.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 24
				-
					-
						“Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.””
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With thongs inserted through the double wound;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						These fix’d up high behind the rolling wain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His graceful head was trail’d along the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Proud on his car the insulting victor stood,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Now lost is all that formidable air;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The face divine, and long-descending hair,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Deform’d, dishonour’d, in his native land,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Given to the rage of an insulting throng,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, in his parents’ sight, now dragg’d along!
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The mother first beheld with sad survey;

				-
					-
						She rent her tresses, venerable grey,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And cast, far off, the regal veils away.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,
					-
				-

						While the sad father answers groans with groans,

					-
						No less than if the rage of hostile fires,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						From her foundations curling to her spires,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 10

						O’er the proud citadel at length should rise,

						And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.

					-
						The wretched monarch of the falling state,

				-
					-
						Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.

						Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-

						While strong affliction gives the feeble force:

						Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,

						In all the raging impotence of woe.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 18

						At length he roll’d in dust, and thus begun,

						And, bending o’er thee, mix’d the tender shower!

						Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,

					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To fair Andromache, of Hector dead;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As yet no messenger had told his fate,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Not e’en his stay without the Scaean gate.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Far in the close recesses of the dome,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pensive she plied the melancholy loom;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A growing work employ’d her secret hours,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Confusedly gay with intermingled flowers.

						Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,

						In vain; alas! her lord returns no more;

					-
						Unbathed he lies, and bleeds along the shore!

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now from the walls the clamours reach her ear,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And all her members shake with sudden fear:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 41: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And thus, astonish’d, to her maids she calls:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah follow me! (she cried) what plaintive noise

				-
					-
						My faltering knees their trembling frame desert,

						A pulse unusual flutters at my heart;

						Some strange disaster, some reverse of fate

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Confronts Achilles; chased along the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shut from our walls! I fear, I fear him slain!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 42: Verse 11

					-
						Safe in the crowd he ever scorn’d to wait,

					-
						And sought for glory in the jaws of fate:

				-
					-
						Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 42: Verse 14

						Now quench’d for ever in the arms of death.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 1

						She spoke: and furious, with distracted pace,

					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fears in her heart, and anguish in her face,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-

						Flies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue),

					-
						And mounts the walls, and sends around her view.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-

						Too soon her eyes the killing object found,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The godlike Hector dragg’d along the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 7

						A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:

					-
						She faints, she falls; her breath, her colour flies.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Her hair’s fair ornaments, the braids that bound,

				-
					-
						The net that held them, and the wreath that crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The veil and diadem flew far away

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 12

					-
						(The gift of Venus on her bridal day).
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-

						Around a train of weeping sisters stands,

				-
					-
						To raise her sinking with assistant hands.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 15

						Scarce from the verge of death recall’d, again

				-

					Book 23: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						On his dead friend’s cold breast, and thus he said:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour’d ghost
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Hear, and rejoice on Pluto’s dreary coast;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Behold! Achilles’ promise is complete;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The bloody Hector stretch’d before thy feet.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						All to Achilles’ sable ship repair,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The bristly victims hissing o’er the fire:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Around the hero’s prostrate body flow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And now a band of Argive monarchs brings
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The glorious victor to the king of kings.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The attending heralds, as by office bound,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The first and greatest of the gods above!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Some ease at least those pious rites may give,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Howe’er, reluctant as I am, I stay
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That Greece the warrior’s funeral pile prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But great Pelides, stretch’d along the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where, dash’d on rocks, the broken billows roar,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lies inly groaning; while on either hand
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Along the grass his languid members fall,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Hush’d by the murmurs of the rolling deep,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem’d to rise:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In the same robe he living wore, he came:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The form familiar hover’d o’er his head,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Living, I seem’d his dearest, tenderest care,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But now forgot, I wander in the air.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And give me entrance in the realms below:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But here and there the unbodied spectres chase
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The vagrant dead around the dark abode,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						When once we pass, the soul returns no more:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When once the last funereal flames ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Me fate has sever’d from the sons of earth,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The fate fore-doom’d that waited from my birth:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Even great and godlike thou art doom’d to fall.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Together have we lived; together bred,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						One house received us, and one table fed;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						May mix our ashes in one common grave.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Once more return’st thou from the realms of night?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O more than brother! Think each office paid,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whate’er can rest a discontented shade;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Afford at least that melancholy joy.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and with his longing arms essay’d
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In vain to grasp the visionary shade!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“’Tis true, ’tis certain; man, though dead, retains
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The form subsists without the body’s aid,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This night my friend, so late in battle lost,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Even now familiar, as in life, he came;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Alas! how different! yet how like the same!”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And now the rosy-finger’d morn appears,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shows every mournful face with tears o’erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And glares on the pale visage of the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With mules and waggons sends a chosen band
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To load the timber, and the pile to rear;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A charge consign’d to Merion’s faithful care.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With proper instruments they take the road,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						First march the heavy mules, securely slow,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						O’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Jumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock’d axles bound.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But when arrived at Ida’s spreading woods,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Fair Ida, water’d with descending floods,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And the slow mules the same rough road return.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 25
				-
					-
						There on the spot which great Achilles show’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 26
				-
					-
						They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Circling around the place, where times to come
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Shall view Patroclus’ and Achilles’ tomb.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The hero bids his martial troops appear
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						High on their cars in all the pomp of war;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 32
				-
					-
						All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The chariots first proceed, a shining train;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Next these the melancholy band appear;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 37
				-
					-
						O’er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Achilles next, oppress’d with mighty woe,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Supporting with his hands the hero’s head,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Bends o’er the extended body of the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Patroclus decent on the appointed ground
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 42
				-
					-
						They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 43
				-
					-
						But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And from his head divides the yellow hair;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Those curling locks which from his youth he vow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And sacred grew, to Sperchius’ honour’d flood:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And roll’d his eyes around the watery waste:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Delightful roll along my native coast!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To whom we vainly vow’d, at our return,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And where in shade of consecrated bowers
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So vow’d my father, but he vow’d in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						No more Achilles sees his native plain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Patroclus bears them to the shades below.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus o’er Patroclus while the hero pray’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And now the sun had set upon their woe;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 6

						“Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Permit the mourning legions to retire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The pious care be ours, the dead to burn—”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He said: the people to their ships return:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						While those deputed to inter the slain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The growing structure spreads on every side;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						High on the top the manly corse they lay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Achilles covered with their fat the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And the piled victims round the body spread;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Suspends around, low-bending o’er the pile.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Fall two, selected to attend their lord,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then last of all, and horrible to tell,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 27
				-
					-
						On these the rage of fire victorious preys,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Involves and joins them in one common blaze.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Smear’d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 13: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Hear, and exult, on Pluto’s dreary coast.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Behold Achilles’ promise fully paid,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Twelve Trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But heavier fates on Hector’s corse attend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Celestial Venus hover’d o’er his head,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						She watch’d him all the night and all the day,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor sacred Phoebus less employ’d his care;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He pour’d around a veil of gather’d air,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And victims promised, and libations cast,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He call’d the aerial powers, along the skies
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The winged Iris heard the hero’s call,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And instant hasten’d to their airy hall,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Where in old Zephyr’s open courts on high,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The rocky pavement glitter’d with the show.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						All from the banquet rise, and each invites
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The various goddess to partake the rites.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And heaven is feasting on the world’s green end
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Far on the extremest limits of the main.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But Peleus’ son entreats, with sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The western spirit, and the north, to rise!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Let on Patroclus’ pile your blast be driven,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And bear the blazing honours high to heaven.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift as the word she vanish’d from their view;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss’d before.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To the wide main then stooping from the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Till on the pile the gather’d tempest falls.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The structure crackles in the roaring fires,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						All night Achilles hails Patroclus’ soul,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With large libations from the golden bowl.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						As a poor father, helpless and undone,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Mourns o’er the ashes of an only son,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So stay’d Achilles, circling round the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						So watch’d the flames, till now they flame no more.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						’Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The morning planet told the approach of light;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And, fast behind, Aurora’s warmer ray
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						O’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And to their caves the whistling winds return’d:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 17: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						First let us quench the yet remaining flame
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The hero’s bones with careful view select:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Apart, and easy to be known they lie
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The rest around the margin will be seen
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						These wrapp’d in double cauls of fat, prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And in the golden vase dispose with care;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There let them rest with decent honour laid,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A common structure on the humble sands:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And late posterity record our praise!”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the pile the sable wine they throw,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And deep subsides the ashy heap below.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Next the white bones his sad companions place,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With tears collected, in the golden vase.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sacred relics to the tent they bore;

					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The urn a veil of linen covered o’er.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						High in the midst they heap the swelling bed
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Of rising earth, memorial of the dead.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The swarming populace the chief detains,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						First stood the prizes to reward the force
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of rapid racers in the dusty course:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A woman for the first, in beauty’s bloom,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Skill’d in the needle, and the labouring loom;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of twenty measures its capacious size.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The second victor claims a mare unbroke,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The third, a charger yet untouch’d by flame;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Four ample measures held the shining frame:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						An ample double bowl contents the last.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						These in fair order ranged upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The hero, rising, thus address’d the train:

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To the brave rulers of the racing steed;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Should our immortal coursers take the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(A race unrivall’d, which from ocean’s god
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Peleus received, and on his son bestow’d.)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But this no time our vigour to display;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And trail those graceful honours on the sand!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Let others for the noble task prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 14

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 23
			-

						Fired at his word the rival racers rise;

						But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,

					-
						Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,

						(Æthe her name) at home to end his days;

						Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 23: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;

					Book 23: Stanza 23: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears
					-

						“My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless’d;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Neptune and Jove on thee conferr’d the skill
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To guide thy conduct little precept needs;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 6

					-
						But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Compare those rivals’ judgment and thy own:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And to be swift is less than to be wise.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 11

					-
						’Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						By art the pilot, through the boiling deep
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And ’tis the artist wins the glorious course;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And short, or wide, the ungovern’d courser drive:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The knowing racer to his end proceeds;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Fix’d on the goal his eye foreruns the course,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 22
				-
					-
						His hand unerring steers the steady horse,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And now contracts, or now extends the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Observing still the foremost on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Mark then the goal, ’tis easy to be found;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Of some once stately oak the last remains,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Or hardy fir, unperish’d with the rains:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And round, a circle for the wheeling car.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 31
				-
					-
						(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Bear close to this, and warily proceed,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 34
				-
					-
						A little bending to the left-hand steed;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 35
				-
					-
						But urge the right, and give him all the reins;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 36
				-
					-
						While thy strict hand his fellow’s head restrains,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The wheel’s round naves appear to brush the goal.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Clear of the stony heap direct the course;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 42
				-
					-
						A joy to others, a reproach to me.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 43
				-
					-
						So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Or the famed race, through all the regions known,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 48
				-
					-
						That whirl’d the car of proud Laomedon.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The last, but not least ardent for the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Roll’d in his helmet, these Achilles throws).
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And next the brother of the king of men:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						They stand in order, an impatient train:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pelides points the barrier on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And sends before old Phoenix to the place,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To mark the racers, and to judge the race.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						At once the coursers from the barrier bound;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The lifted scourges all at once resound;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And up the champaign thunder from the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						(Each o’er his flying courser hung in air,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Now (the last compass fetch’d around the goal)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 30
				-
					-
						At the near prize each gathers all his soul,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Each burns with double hope, with double pain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 33
				-
					-
						First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 34
				-
					-
						With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Close on Eumelus’ back they puff the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And seem just mounting on his car behind;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And, hovering o’er, their stretching shadows sees.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 40
				-
					-
						But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 42
				-
					-
						His matchless horses’ labour on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Snatch’d from his hope the glories of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 48
				-
					-
						She breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 49
				-
					-
						No more their way the startled horses held;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The car reversed came rattling on the field;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 53
				-
					-
						His batter’d face and elbows strike the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish’d wound:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Before him far the glad Tydides flies;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Minerva’s spirit drives his matchless pace,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And crowns him victor of the labour’d race.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Not that we hope to match Tydides’ horse,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And gives their lord the honours of the day;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Your swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The last ignoble gift be all we gain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						No more shall Nestor’s hand your food supply,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The old man’s fury rises, and ye die.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Presents the occasion, could we use it right.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus he. The coursers at their master’s threat
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And now Antilochus with nice survey
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Observes the compass of the hollow way.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						’Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Fast by the road a precipice was worn:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And wonders at the rashness of his foe.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						“Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or both must fall.”—Atrides cried in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Far as an able arm the disk can send,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						When youthful rivals their full force extend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His horse compell’d; foreboding in his fears
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 26
				-
					-
						“Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Go, but expect not I’ll the prize resign;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 30
				-
					-
						“Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 32
				-
					-
						With fainting knees shall labour in the course,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And yield the glory yours.”—The steeds obey;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Already at their heels they wing their way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 27: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And seem already to retrieve the day.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The first who mark’d them was the Cretan king;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High on a rising ground, above the ring,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He well observed the chief who led the way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 7

						And heard from far his animating cries,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						“Are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Or can ye, all, another chief survey,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And other steeds than lately led the way?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Lie sure disabled in the middle field:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 18
				-
					-
						I search to find them, but I search in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Perchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With frantic fury from the destined way.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Rise then some other, and inform my sight,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 24
				-
					-
						For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 28: Verse 26

					-
						The great Ætolian chief, renown’d in war.”

						“Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)

				-
					-
						Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;

					-
						Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,

						Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.

						Still, as at first, unrivall’d lead the race:

					-
						“Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!

				-
					-
						Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The last in merit, as the first in pride!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To vile reproach what answer can we make?

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A goblet or a tripod let us stake,

						And be the king the judge. The most unwise

						“Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;

						Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.

						High o’er his head the circling lash he wields:

				-
					-
						His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:

						So swift, it seem’d a flight, and not a race.

						Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,

						“Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass’d

				-
					-
						But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 36: Verse 4

						With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;

				-
					-
						The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And still’d the clamour of the shouting bands.

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not without cause incensed at Nestor’s son,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 38: Verse 8

					-
						“The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain’d,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 39: Verse 3

						Robb’d of my glory and my just reward,

					-
						Or judge me envious of a rival’s fame.

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The prudent chief with calm attention heard;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then mildly thus: “Excuse, if youth have err’d;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,
					-
				-

						Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.

						The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;

					Book 23: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The mare, or aught thou ask’st, be freely thine

				-
					-
						Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke Antilochus; and at the word
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The mare contested to the king restored.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 41: Verse 3

					-
						Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain

				-
					-
						Such joy the Spartan’s shining face o’erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-

					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And thus the purpose of his gift declares:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For ever snatch’d from our desiring eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Take thou this token of a grateful heart,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Though ’tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 43: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But left the glory of the past thy own.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and placed the goblet at his side;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With joy the venerable king replied:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A senior honour’d, and a friend beloved!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Too true it is, deserted of my strength,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						These wither’d arms and limbs have fail’d at length.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Victorious then in every solemn game,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ordain’d to Amarynces’ mighty name;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The brave Epeians gave my glory way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ætolians, Pylians, all resign’d the day.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 11
				-
					-
						I quell’d Clytomedes in fights of hand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And backward hurl’d Ancaeus on the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Surpass’d Iphyclus in the swift career,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But won by numbers, not by art or force:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For the famed twins, impatient to survey
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Sprung to their car; and with united pains
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 20
				-
					-
						One lash’d the coursers, while one ruled the reins.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 22
				-
					-
						A younger race, that emulate our deeds:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 23
				-
					-
						I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Though once the foremost hero of the field.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 26
				-
					-
						With martial honours decorate the dead:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 27
				-
					-
						While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 28
				-
					-
						(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Not one but honours sacred age and me:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 45: Verse 32
				-
					-
						May the just gods return another day!”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The prizes next are order’d to the field,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For the bold champions who the caestus wield.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of six years’ age, unconscious of the yoke,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Achilles rising, thus: “Let Greece excite
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The vanquish’d bear the massy bowl away.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						High o’er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And seized the beast, and thus began to say:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 4
				-
					-
						“Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 6
				-
					-
						This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Others, ’tis own’d, in fields of battle shine,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But the first honours of this fight are mine;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For who excels in all? Then let my foe
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 48: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To heave the batter’d carcase off the plain.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The host beheld him, silent with amaze!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						’Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(The games ordain’d dead OEdipus to grace,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Him great Tydides urges to contend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Officious with the cincture girds him round;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Amid the circle now each champion stands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And poises high in air his iron hands;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And painful sweat from all their members flows.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 18
				-
					-
						At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Beneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Down dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 22
				-
					-
						As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 23
				-
					-
						By some huge billow dash’d against the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Lies panting; not less batter’d with his wound,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 26
				-
					-
						To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And dragging his disabled legs along;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 31
				-
					-
						His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Wrapp’d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 49: Verse 33
				-
					-
						His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The third bold game Achilles next demands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A massy tripod for the victor lies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of twice six oxen its reputed price;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And next, the loser’s spirits to restore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A female captive, valued but at four.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Embracing rigid with implicit hands.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Close lock’d above, their heads and arms are mix’d:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Below, their planted feet at distance fix’d;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Their tops connected, but at wider space
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fix’d on the centre stands their solid base.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now to the grasp each manly body bends;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The humid sweat from every pore descends;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 22
				-
					-
						O’erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The watchful caution of his artful foe.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 25
				-
					-
						While the long strife even tired the lookers on,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 27
				-
					-
						“Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 50: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He barely stirr’d him, but he could not raise:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His knee lock’d fast, the foe’s attempt denied;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Defiled with honourable dust they roll,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Again they rage, again to combat rise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 51: Verse 14
				-
					-
						When great Achilles thus divides the prize:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ye both have won: let others who excel,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The hero’s words the willing chiefs obey,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And, clothed anew, the following games survey.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The youths contending in the rapid race:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A silver urn that full six measures held,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By none in weight or workmanship excell’d:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Elaborate, with artifice divine;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From him descended, good Eunaeus heir’d
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:

						Now, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A well-fed ox was for the second placed;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And half a talent must content the last.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Achilles rising then bespoke the train:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 54: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The hero said, and starting from his place,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Oilean Ajax rises to the race;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass’d
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His youthful equals, Nestor’s son, the last.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Pelides points the barrier with his hand;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All start at once; Oileus led the race;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Behind him, diligently close, he sped,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 10
				-
					-
						As closely following as the running thread
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The spindle follows, and displays the charms
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And send their souls before him as he flies.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now three times turn’d in prospect of the goal,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 21
				-
					-
						“Assist, O goddess!” thus in thought he pray’d!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And present at his thought descends the maid.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Buoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 25
				-
					-
						All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 27
				-
					-
						(O’erturn’d by Pallas), where the slippery shore
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Was clogg’d with slimy dung and mingled gore.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 29
				-
					-
						(The self-same place beside Patroclus’ pyre,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Where late the slaughter’d victims fed the fire.)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Besmear’d with filth, and blotted o’er with clay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And left the urn Ulysses’ rich reward.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 55: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The baffled hero thus the Greeks address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						She urged her favourite on the rapid way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt and gore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 58
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Why with our wiser elders should we strive?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The gods still love them, and they always thrive.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(A green old age unconscious of decays,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That proves the hero born in better days!)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Behold his vigour in this active race!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For who can match Achilles? He who can,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 58: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Must yet be more than hero, more than man.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 59
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Receive a talent of the purest gold.”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The youth departs content. The host admire
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 59: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 60
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now grace the lists before our army’s sight,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who first the jointed armour shall explore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And stain his rival’s mail with issuing gore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The sword Asteropaeus possess’d of old,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker’s side:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 14
				-
					-
						These arms in common let the chiefs divide:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For each brave champion, when the combat ends,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 60: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 61
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew’d.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A furious pass the spear of Ajax made
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay’d.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not thus the foe: his javelin aim’d above
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The buckler’s margin, at the neck he drove.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But Greece, now trembling for her hero’s life,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet still the victor’s due Tydides gains,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 61: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With him the sword and studded belt remains.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then hurl’d the hero, thundering on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A mass of iron (an enormous round),
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And from his whirling arm dismiss in air;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The giant by Achilles slain, he stow’d
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Among his spoils this memorable load.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 9
				-
					-
						For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That teach the disk to sound along the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If he be one enrich’d with large domain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Small stock of iron needs that man provide;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 17
				-
					-
						From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city’s aid
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 62: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.”
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 63
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Stern Polypoetes stepp’d before the throng,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose force with rival forces to oppose,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 6
				-
					-
						High o’er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Leonteus next a little space surpass’d;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 9
				-
					-
						O’er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From Polypoetes’ arm the discus sung:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 12
				-
					-
						That distant falls among the grazing cows,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So past them all the rapid circle flies:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 63: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With force conjoin’d heave off the weighty prize.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 64
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Those, who in skilful archery contend,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He next invites the twanging bow to bend;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The hero fixes in the sandy shore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 64: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The trembling mark at which their arrows fly.
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 65
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 2
				-
					-
						These two-edged axes, terrible in war;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The single, he whose shaft divides the cord.”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He said: experienced Merion took the word;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But flies unbless’d! No grateful sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 9
				-
					-
						No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To Phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For this, thy well-aim’d arrow turn’d aside,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Err’d from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And Merion eager meditates the wound:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And following with his eye the soaring dove,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Implores the god to speed it through the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Quite through and through the point its passage found,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 26
				-
					-
						With flagging wings alighted on the mast,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then sudden dropp’d, and left her life in air.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 65: Verse 29
				-
					-
						From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,

						To close the funeral games, Achilles last
					-

				-
					-
						A massy spear amid the circle placed,
					-
				-

						And ample charger of unsullied frame,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 66: Verse 4

						With flowers high-wrought, not blacken’d yet by flame.

						For these he bids the heroes prove their art,

						Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;

						With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,

						Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:

				-
					-
						His friend’s dear image present to his mind,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 19

						Then starting up, disconsolate he goes

					-
						While foul in dust the unhonour’d carcase lies,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 29

						But not deserted by the pitying skies:

						For Phoebus watch’d it with superior care,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-

						Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;

					-
						And, ignominious as it swept the field,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Spread o’er the sacred corse his golden shield.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 34

						All heaven was moved, and Hermes will’d to go

						By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,

				-
					-
						And can ye still his cold remains pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Still grudge his body to the Trojans’ view?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The last sad honours of a funeral fire?

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Is then the dire Achilles all your care?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That iron heart, inflexibly severe;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 10

						In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;

				-
					-
						Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,

						Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!

				-

						Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,

				-
					-
						The greatest evil and the greatest good.

					-
						Still for one loss he rages unresign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;

						Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:

						Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;

						Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.

						But this insatiate, the commission given

						By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven:

						Lo, how his rage dishonest drags along

						Hector’s dead earth, insensible of wrong!

					-
						Brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,

					-
						“Arise, O Thetis! from thy seats below,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 5: Verse 19

					-
						Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 5: Verse 21

					-
						Howe’er, be heaven’s almighty sire obey’d—”

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 5: Verse 24

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Which, flowing long, her graceful person clad;

				-

						Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With Troilus, dreadful on his rushing car,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And last great Hector, more than man divine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For sure he seem’d not of terrestrial line!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						All those relentless Mars untimely slew,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And left me these, a soft and servile crew,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whose days the feast and wanton dance employ,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Gluttons and flatterers, the contempt of Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And speed my journey to redeem my son?”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The sons their father’s wretched age revere,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Forgive his anger, and produce the car.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						High on the seat the cabinet they bind:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The new-made car with solid beauty shined;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Box was the yoke, emboss’d with costly pains,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And hung with ringlets to receive the reins;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						These to the chariot’s polish’d pole they bound.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then fix’d a ring the running reins to guide,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And close beneath the gather’d ends were tied.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Next with the gifts (the price of Hector slain)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The sad attendants load the groaning wain:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(The gift of Mysia to the Trojan king.)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But the fair horses, long his darling care,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Himself received, and harness’d to his car:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Grieved as he was, he not this task denied;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The hoary herald help’d him, at his side.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While careful these the gentle coursers join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Sad Hecuba approach’d with anxious mind;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A golden bowl that foam’d with fragrant wine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(Libation destined to the power divine,)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Held in her right, before the steed she stands,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And thus consigns it to the monarch’s hands:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Take this, and pour to Jove; that safe from harms

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His grace restore thee to our roof and arms.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Since victor of thy fears, and slighting mine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Heaven, or thy soul, inspires this bold design;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Pray to that god, who high on Ida’s brow
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Surveys thy desolated realms below,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His winged messenger to send from high,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And lead thy way with heavenly augury:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Tower on the right of yon ethereal space.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						That sign beheld, and strengthen’d from above,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Boldly pursue the journey mark’d by Jove:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But if the god his augury denies,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 23: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“’Tis just (said Priam) to the sire above

				-
					-
						To raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?”
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The purest water of the living spring:

				-
					-
						(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)
					-
				-

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:

					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O first and greatest! heaven’s imperial lord!

				-
					-
						To stern Achilles now direct my ways,
					-
				-

					-
						And teach him mercy when a father prays.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If such thy will, despatch from yonder sky
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy sacred bird, celestial augury!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 7

					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Despatch’d his bird, celestial augury!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The swift-wing’d chaser of the feather’d game,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And known to gods by Percnos’ lofty name.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Wide as appears some palace-gate display’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So broad, his pinions stretch’d their ample shade,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As stooping dexter with resounding wings
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The imperial bird descends in airy rings.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A dawn of joy in every face appears:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The mourning matron dries her timorous tears:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The brazen portal in his passage rung;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The mules preceding draw the loaded wain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Charged with the gifts: Idaeus holds the rein:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The king himself his gentle steeds controls,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						On his slow wheels the following people wait,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With hands uplifted eye him as he pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And gaze upon him as they gazed their last.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Now forward fares the father on his way,

				-

				-
					-
						Through the lone fields, and back to Ilion they.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Great Jove beheld him as he cross’d the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And felt the woes of miserable man.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then thus to Hermes: “Thou whose constant cares
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Still succour mortals, and attend their prayers;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Behold an object to thy charge consign’d:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 28
				-
					-
						If ever pity touch’d thee for mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Go, guard the sire: the observing foe prevent,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And safe conduct him to Achilles’ tent.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The god obeys, his golden pinions binds,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And mounts incumbent on the wings of winds,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That high, through fields of air, his flight sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O’er the wide earth, and o’er the boundless main;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus arm’d, swift Hermes steers his airy way,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stoops on Hellespont’s resounding sea.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A beauteous youth, majestic and divine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He seem’d; fair offspring of some princely line!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Now twilight veil’d the glaring face of day,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And clad the dusky fields in sober grey;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What time the herald and the hoary king
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(Their chariots stopping at the silver spring,

				-
					-
						That circling Ilus’ ancient marble flows)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Allow’d their mules and steeds a short repose,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Through the dim shade the herald first espies
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A man’s approach, and thus to Priam cries:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 19
				-
					-
						“I mark some foe’s advance: O king! beware;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 20
				-
					-
						This hard adventure claims thy utmost care!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For much I fear destruction hovers nigh:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Our state asks counsel; is it best to fly?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The afflicted monarch shiver’d with despair;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A sudden trembling shook his aged frame:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When Hermes, greeting, touch’d his royal hand,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Say whither, father! when each mortal sight

				-
					-
						Is seal’d in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 29: Verse 3

						Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,

					-
						These, who with endless hate thy race pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 29: Verse 7

					-
						Thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 29: Verse 9

				Book 24: Stanza 32

						To serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To watch this quarter, my adventure falls:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And scarce their rulers check their martial rage.”

						Ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-

						My son’s dear relics? what befalls him dead?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 5

					-
						Have dogs dismember’d (on the naked plains),

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 6

						Or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?”

						Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,

					-
						But whole he lies, neglected in the tent:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This the twelfth evening since he rested there,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 35: Verse 6

						Untouch’d by worms, untainted by the air.

						Those who inhabit the Olympian bower

						Even to the ashes of the just is kind.

					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 10

						A pledge of gratitude for Hector’s sake;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 11

					-
						And while the favouring gods our steps survey,

						But can I, absent from my prince’s sight,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What from our master’s interest thus we draw,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Is but a licensed theft that ’scapes the law.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Respecting him, my soul abjures the offence;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And as the crime, I dread the consequence.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 9

						Thee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;

						He said, then took the chariot at a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And snatch’d the reins, and whirl’d the lash around:
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Before the inspiring god that urged them on,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The coursers fly with spirit not their own.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And now they reach’d the naval walls, and found

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The guards repasting, while the bowls go round;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 7

						On these the virtue of his wand he tries,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And o’er the trenches led the rolling cars.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And now approach’d Pelides’ lofty tent.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						On firs the roof was raised, and cover’d o’er
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With reeds collected from the marshy shore;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A solid pine-tree barr’d of wondrous length:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But great Achilles singly closed the gate.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then swift alighted the celestial guide,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And thus reveal’d—”Hear, prince! and understand
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Thou ow’st thy guidance to no mortal hand:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Hermes I am, descended from above,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The king of arts, the messenger of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Farewell: to shun Achilles’ sight I fly;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Uncommon are such favours of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Nor stand confess’d to frail mortality.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Adjure him by his father’s silver hairs,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His son, his mother! urge him to bestow
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Whatever pity that stern heart can know.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having said, he vanish’d from his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And in a moment shot into the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king, confirm’d from heaven, alighted there,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And left his aged herald on the car,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With solemn pace through various rooms he went,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And found Achilles in his inner tent:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And great Automedon, attendance gave:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						These served his person at the royal feast;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Unseen by these, the king his entry made:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, prostrate now before Achilles laid,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Those direful hands his kisses press’d, embrued
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Even with the best, the dearest of his blood!
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pursued for murder, flies his native clime)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						All mute, yet seem’d to question with their eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Each look’d on other, none the silence broke,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah think, thou favour’d of the powers divine!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Think of thy father’s age, and pity mine!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In me that father’s reverend image trace,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Those silver hairs, that venerable face;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In all my equal, but in misery!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Expels him helpless from his peaceful state;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And beg protection with a feeble cry.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And, hearing, still may hope a better day
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 14
				-
					-
						May send him thee, to chase that foe away.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 15
				-
					-
						No comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Yet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The pledge of many a loved and loving dame:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Nineteen one mother bore—Dead, all are dead!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 20
				-
					-
						How oft, alas! has wretched Priam bled!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Still one was left their loss to recompense;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 22
				-
					-
						His father’s hope, his country’s last defence.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 42: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Unhappy in his country’s cause he fell!
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 43

					-
						“For him through hostile camps I bent my way,

					-
						For him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 43: Verse 3

					-
						Large gifts proportion’d to thy wrath I bear;

				-
					-
						See him in me, as helpless and as old!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Though not so wretched: there he yields to me,

				-
					-
						The first of men in sovereign misery!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 44: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The scourge and ruin of my realm and race;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 44: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Suppliant my children’s murderer to implore,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 44: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These words soft pity in the chief inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Touch’d with the dear remembrance of his sire.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The old man’s cheek he gently turn’d away.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And now the mingled tides together flow:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This low on earth, that gently bending o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A father one, and one a son deplore:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But great Achilles different passions rend,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The infectious softness through the heroes ran;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 12
				-
					-
						One universal solemn shower began;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 45: Verse 13
				-
					-
						They bore as heroes, but they felt as man.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 46
			-

					Book 24: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Satiate at length with unavailing woes,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From the high throne divine Achilles rose;

				-
					-
						The reverend monarch by the hand he raised;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On his white beard and form majestic gazed,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not unrelenting; then serene began
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 46: Verse 6

						A strength proportion’d to the woes you feel.

						Rise, then: let reason mitigate your care:

				-
					-
						To mourn avails not: man is born to bear.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Such is, alas! the gods’ severe decree:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						They, only they are blest, and only free.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 11

						Two urns by Jove’s high throne have ever stood,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The source of evil one, and one of good;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 13
				-
					-
						From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Blessings to these, to those distributes ill;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To most he mingles both: the wretch decreed
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To taste the bad unmix’d, is cursed indeed;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The happiest taste not happiness sincere;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But find the cordial draught is dash’d with care.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Who more than Peleus shone in wealth and power
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 22
				-
					-
						What stars concurring bless’d his natal hour!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;

						Graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 25
				-
					-
						One evil yet o’ertakes his latest day:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 26
				-
					-
						No race succeeding to imperial sway;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 27
				-
					-
						An only son; and he, alas! ordain’d
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To fall untimely in a foreign land.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 29
				-
					-
						See him, in Troy, the pious care decline
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 31

					-
						Thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 32
				-
					-
						In riches once, in children once excell’d;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 33

					-
						Extended Phrygia own’d thy ample reign,

						And all fair Lesbos’ blissful seats contain,

						And all wide Hellespont’s unmeasured main.

						But since the god his hand has pleased to turn,

				-
					-
						And fill thy measure from his bitter urn,

						What sees the sun, but hapless heroes’ falls?

						War, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!

					-
						What must be, must be. Bear thy lot, nor shed

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 47: Verse 41

						These unavailing sorrows o’er the dead;

						Thou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,

				-
					-
						(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)

				-

						Cassandra first beholds, from Ilion’s spire,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 60: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 60: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A shower of tears o’erflows her beauteous eyes,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 60: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Alarming thus all Ilion with her cries:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 61
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,

				-
					-
						Ye wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If e’er ye rush’d in crowds, with vast delight,

				-
					-
						To hail your hero glorious from the fight,

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 1

				-
					-
						Nor man nor woman in the walls remains;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In every face the self-same grief is shown;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And Troy sends forth one universal groan.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At Scaea’s gates they meet the mourning wain,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The wife and mother, frantic with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter’d hair:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And there had sigh’d and sorrow’d out the day;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But godlike Priam from the chariot rose:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 12
				-
					-
						“Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 13
				-
					-
						First to the palace let the car proceed,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 62: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Then pour your boundless sorrows o’er the dead.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 63
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The waves of people at his word divide,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Slow rolls the chariot through the following tide;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Even to the palace the sad pomp they wait:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They weep, and place him on the bed of state.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A melancholy choir attend around,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With plaintive sighs, and music’s solemn sound:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Alternately they sing, alternate flow
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The obedient tears, melodious in their woe.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 63: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And nature speaks at every pause of art.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 64
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 1
				-
					-
						First to the corse the weeping consort flew;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Around his neck her milk-white arms she threw,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“And oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord! (she cries)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Snatch’d in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 6

					-
						And I abandon’d, desolate, alone!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 7
				-
					-
						An only son, once comfort of our pains,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Sad product now of hapless love, remains!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Never to manly age that son shall rise,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or with increasing graces glad my eyes:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For Ilion now (her great defender slain)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Who now protects her wives with guardian care?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Who saves her infants from the rage of war?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now hostile fleets must waft those infants o’er
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The sad companion of thy mother’s woe;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Driven hence a slave before the victor’s sword
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Condemn’d to toil for some inhuman lord:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Or else some Greek whose father press’d the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 23
				-
					-
						In Hector’s blood his vengeance shall enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 25
				-
					-
						For thy stern father never spared a foe:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 27

						Thence many evils his sad parents bore,

				-
					-
						His parents many, but his consort more.

						Why gav’st thou not to me thy dying hand?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And why received not I thy last command?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Some word thou would’st have spoke, which, sadly dear,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 32
				-
					-
						My soul might keep, or utter with a tear;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 64: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Which never, never could be lost in air,

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 65

						Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,

					Book 24: Stanza 65: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 66
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The mournful mother next sustains her part:

				-
					-
						“O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of all my race thou most by heaven approved,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 4

					-
						And by the immortals even in death beloved!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While all my other sons in barbarous bands

					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Free, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Sentenced, ’tis true, by his inhuman doom,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy noble corse was dragg’d around the tomb;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet glow’st thou fresh with every living grace;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 14
				-
					-
						No mark of pain, or violence of face:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Rosy and fair! as Phoebus’ silver bow
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 66: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Dismiss’d thee gently to the shades below.”

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 67
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 67: Verse 1
				-

						Thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.

				-
					-
						Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 67: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 67: Verse 4

						Fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 4

						(O had I perish’d, ere that form divine

						Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)

						Yet was it ne’er my fate, from thee to find

						When others cursed the authoress of their woe,

					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy pity check’d my sorrows in their flow.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 11
				-
					-
						If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thy gentle accents soften’d all my pain.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The wretched source of all this misery.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 16

					-
						The fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;

					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Through Troy’s wide streets abandon’d shall I roam!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 68: Verse 19

						In Troy deserted, as abhorr’d at home!”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 69
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 1

						So spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.

					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On all around the infectious sorrow grows;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But Priam check’d the torrent as it rose:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 6

					Book 24: Stanza 69: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;

						Achilles grants these honours to the dead.”

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 70
			-

						He spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 70: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Their mules and oxen harness to the wain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 70: Verse 3

						Pour through the gates, and fell’d from Ida’s crown,

						Roll back the gather’d forests to the town.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 70: Verse 5
				-

						These toils continue nine succeeding days,

						And high in air a sylvan structure raise.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 70: Verse 7

						But when the tenth fair morn began to shine,
