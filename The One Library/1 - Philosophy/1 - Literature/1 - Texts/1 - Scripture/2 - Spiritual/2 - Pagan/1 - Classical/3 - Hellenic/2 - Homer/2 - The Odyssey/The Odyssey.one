				Book 1: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The man for wisdom’s various arts renown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their manners noted, and their states survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						On stormy seas unnumber’d toils he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						On herds devoted to the god of day;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The god vindictive doom’d them never more
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(Ah, men unbless’d!) to touch that natal shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Oh, snatch some portion of these acts from fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Celestial Muse! and to our world relate.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						All who the wars of ten long years survived;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And ’scaped the perils of the gulfy main.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Ulysses, sole of all the victor train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						An exile from his dear paternal coast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Deplored his absent queen and empire lost.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Calypso in her caves constrain’d his stay,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In vain-for now the circling years disclose
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The day predestined to reward his woes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						At length his Ithaca is given by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where yet new labours his arrival wait;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						At length their rage the hostile powers restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						All but the ruthless monarch of the main.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But now the god, remote, a heavenly guest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In Æthiopia graced the genial feast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						(A race divided, whom with sloping rays
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The rising and descending sun surveys);
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						There on the world’s extremest verge revered
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Distant he lay: while in the bright abodes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Of high Olympus, Jove convened the gods:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The assembly thus the sire supreme address’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						AEgysthus’ fate revolving in his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Of Pluto sent, a blood-polluted ghost.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Charge all their woes on absolute degree;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						All to the dooming gods their guilt translate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And follies are miscall’d the crimes of fate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When to his lust AEgysthus gave the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Did fate, or we, the adulterous act constrain?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Did fate, or we, when great Atrides died,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Urge the bold traitor to the regicide?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hermes I sent, while yet his soul remain’d
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Sincere from royal blood, and faith profaned;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To warn the wretch, that young Orestes, grown
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To manly years, should re-assert the throne.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet, impotent of mind, and uncontroll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He plunged into the gulf which Heaven foretold.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Here paused the god; and pensive thus replies
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Minerva, graceful with her azure eyes:
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O thou! from whom the whole creation springs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The source of power on earth derived to kings!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His death was equal to the direful deed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						So may the man of blood be doomed to bleed!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But grief and rage alternate wound my breast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For brave Ulysses, still by fate oppress’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Amidst an isle, around whose rocky shore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The forests murmur, and the surges roar,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The blameless hero from his wish’d-for home
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A goddess guards in her enchanted dome;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(Atlas her sire, to whose far-piercing eye
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The wonders of the deep expanded lie;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The eternal columns which on earth he rears
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						End in the starry vault, and prop the spheres).
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						By his fair daughter is the chief confined,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Who soothes to dear delight his anxious mind;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Successless all her soft caresses prove,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To banish from his breast his country’s love;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To see the smoke from his loved palace rise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						While the dear isle in distant prospect lies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With what contentment could he close his eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And will Omnipotence neglect to save
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The suffering virtue of the wise and brave?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Must he, whose altars on the Phrygian shore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With frequent rites, and pure, avow’d thy power,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Be doom’d the worst of human ills to prove,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Unbless’d, abandon’d to the wrath of Jove?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Daughter! what words have pass’d thy lips unweigh’d!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Replied the Thunderer to the martial maid;)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Deem not unjustly by my doom oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of human race the wisest and the best.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Neptune, by prayer repentant rarely won,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Afflicts the chief, to avenge his giant son,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose visual orb Ulysses robb’d of light;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Great Polypheme, of more than mortal might?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Him young Thousa bore (the bright increase
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of Phorcys, dreaded in the sounds and seas);
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whom Neptune eyed with bloom of beauty bless’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And in his cave the yielding nymph compress’d
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For this the god constrains the Greek to roam,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A hopeless exile from his native home,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						From death alone exempt—but cease to mourn;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Let all combine to achieve his wish’d return;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Neptune atoned, his wrath shall now refrain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or thwart the synod of the gods in vain.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Father and king adored!” Minerva cried,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Since all who in the Olympian bower reside
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now make the wandering Greek their public care,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Let Hermes to the Atlantic isle repair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Bid him, arrived in bright Calypso’s court,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sanction of the assembled powers report:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						That wise Ulysses to his native land
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Must speed, obedient to their high command.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Meantime Telemachus, the blooming heir
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of sea-girt Ithaca, demands my care;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						’Tis mine to form his green, unpractised years
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In sage debates; surrounded with his peers,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To save the state, and timely to restrain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The bold intrusion of the suitor-train;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Who crowd his palace, and with lawless power
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His herds and flocks in feastful rites devour.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To distant Sparta, and the spacious waste
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of Sandy Pyle, the royal youth shall haste.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						There, warm with filial love, the cause inquire
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						That from his realm retards his god-like sire;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Delivering early to the voice of fame
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The promise of a green immortal name.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said: the sandals of celestial mould,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fledged with ambrosial plumes, and rich with gold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Surround her feet: with these sublime she sails
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The aërial space, and mounts the winged gales;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O’er earth and ocean wide prepared to soar,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Ponderous and vast: which, when her fury burns,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o’erturns.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From high Olympus prone her flight she bends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And in the realms of Ithaca descends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Her lineaments divine, the grave disguise
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of Mentes’ form conceal’d from human eyes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(Mentes, the monarch of the Taphian land);
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A glittering spear waved awful in her hand.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There in the portal placed, the heaven-born maid
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Enormous riot and misrule survey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						On hides of beeves, before the palace gate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						(Sad spoils of luxury), the suitors sate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With rival art, and ardour in their mien,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						At chess they vie, to captivate the queen;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Divining of their loves. Attending nigh,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						A menial train the flowing bowl supply.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Others, apart, the spacious hall prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And form the costly feast with busy care.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						There young Telemachus, his bloomy face
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Glowing celestial sweet, with godlike grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Amid the circle shines: but hope and fear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						(Painful vicissitude!) his bosom tear.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Now, imaged in his mind, he sees restored
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						In peace and joy the people’s rightful lord;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The proud oppressors fly the vengeful sword.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						While his fond soul these fancied triumphs swell’d,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The stranger guest the royal youth beheld;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Grieved that a visitant so long should wait
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Unmark’d, unhonour’d, at a monarch’s gate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Instant he flew with hospitable haste,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And the new friend with courteous air embraced.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						“Stranger, whoe’er thou art, securely rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Affianced in my faith, a ready guest;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Approach the dome, the social banquet share,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And then the purpose of thy soul declare.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus affable and mild, the prince precedes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And to the dome the unknown celestial leads.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The spear receiving from the hand, he placed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Against a column, fair with sculpture graced;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ulysses’ arms now long disused to blood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He led the goddess to the sovereign seat,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Her feet supported with a stool of state
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(A purple carpet spread the pavement wide);
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then drew his seat, familiar, to her side;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far from the suitor-train, a brutal crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With insolence, and wine, elate and loud:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Where the free guest, unnoted, might relate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 9: Verse 14

						Thus he, though conscious of the ethereal guest,

						Answer’d evasive of the sly request.

						Meantime the lyre rejoins the sprightly lay;

						Love-dittied airs, and dance, conclude the day

						The mirthful train dispersing quit the court,

						And to their several domes to rest resort.

						A towering structure to the palace join’d;

						To this his steps the thoughtful prince inclined:

						In his pavilion there, to sleep repairs;

						The bolt, obedient to the silken cord,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						To the strong staple’s inmost depth restored,

				-
					-
						Pensive, the rules the goddess gave he weigh’d;

				-
					-
						Stretch’d on the downy fleece, no rest he knows,

						Glow’d in the front of heaven, and gave the day

						Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night.

						A royal robe he wore with graceful pride,

					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 6

					-
						A two-edged falchion threaten’d by his side,

						Then by his heralds, restless of delay,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To council calls the peers: the peers obey.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-

						Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From his high dome himself descends in state.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 1: Verse 13

						Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined;

						AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke;

					-
						A length of days his soul with prudence crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-

						A length of days had bent him to the ground.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-

						His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came,

					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						By great Ulysses taught the path to fame;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His quivering limbs, and quaff’d his spouting gore.

						Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns,

				Book 2: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains,

						Within these walls inglorious silence reigns.

				-
					-
						Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Why here once more in solemn council sit?

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-

						Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose:

						Arrives some message of invading foes?

						Or say, does high necessity of state

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-

						Inspire some patriot, and demand debate?

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 9

						Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 1

				-
					-
						(His royal hand the imperial sceptre sway’d);

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 4

					-
						Then thus, addressing to AEgyptius, said:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Reverend old man! lo here confess’d he stands

						No story I unfold of public woes,

						Nor bear advices of impending foes:

						Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown:

						Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 7

						For my lost sire continual sorrows spring,

						The great, the good; your father and your king.

						Yet more; our house from its foundation bows,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Our foes are powerful, and your sons the foes;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 11

						Hither, unwelcome to the queen, they come;

					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome?

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-

						If she must wed, from other hands require

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The dowry: is Telemachus her sire?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Yet through my court the noise of revel rings,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And waste the wise frugality of kings.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 19

					-
						Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.
					-
				-

						But come it will, the time when manhood grants

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						More powerful advocates than vain complaints.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Approach that hour! insufferable wrong
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Your fame revere, but most the avenging skies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 27

					-
						By all the deathless powers that reign above,

						By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						(Themis, who gives to councils, or denies

						Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise),

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 31

						Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow

					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe.

						If e’er he bore the sword to strengthen ill,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Or, having power to wrong, betray’d the will,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 36

						If ruin to your royal race ye doom,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						But while your sons commit the unpunish’d wrong,

				-
					-
						And dash’d the imperial sceptre to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The big round tear hung trembling in his eye:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The synod grieved, and gave a pitying sigh,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then silent sate—at length Antinous burns
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With haughty rage, and sternly thus returns:

						“O insolence of youth! whose tongue affords

						Where as to life the wondrous figures rise,

						“Though cold in death Ulysses breathes no more,

						Cease, till to great Laertes I bequeath

						When he, whom living mighty realms obey’d,

						“Ev’n nature starts, and what ye ask denies.

						Thus, shall I thus repay a mother’s cares,

						Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dower?

					-
						For never, never wicked man was wise.

						Blind they rejoice, though now, ev’n now they fall;

				-
					-
						Death hastes amain: one hour o’erwhelms them all!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And lo, with speed we plough the watery way;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 18
				-
					-
						My power shall guard thee, and my hand convey:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The winged vessel studious I prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Through seas and realms companion of thy care.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Thou to the court ascend: and to the shores
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(When night advances) bear the naval stores;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Bread, that decaying man with strength supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And generous wine, which thoughtful sorrow flies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the mariners, by my command,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Shall speed aboard, a valiant chosen band.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 27
				-

						Wide o’er the bay, by vessel vessel rides;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 25: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The best I choose to waft then o’er the tides.”

				Book 2: Stanza 26

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She spoke: to his high dome the prince returns,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, as he moves, with royal anguish mourns.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						’Twas riot all, among the lawless train;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Boar bled by boar, and goat by goat lay slain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Arrived, his hand the gay Antinous press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus deriding, with a smile address’d:

			-
				Book 2: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Grieve not, O daring prince! that noble heart;

				-
					-
						Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Indulge the genial hour, unbend thy soul,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Leave thought to age, and drain the flowing bowl.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Studious to ease thy grief, our care provides

						“Is this (returns the prince) for mirth a time?

						The luscious wines, dishonour’d, lose their taste;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 28: Verse 4

						The song is noise, and impious is the feast.

						Suffice it to have spent with swift decay

						Here, or in Pyle—in Pyle, or here, your foe.

						Deny your vessels, ye deny in vain:

					-
						A private voyager I pass the main.

						Where lay the treasures of the Ithacian race:

						Here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed;

					-
						There polished chests embroider’d vestures graced;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-

						Here jars of oil breathed forth a rich perfume;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 33: Verse 6

				-
					-
						(Pure flavorous wine, by gods in bounty given

						The great Ulysses reach’d his native shore.

						A double strength of bars secured the gates;

						To keep my voyage from the royal ear,

				Book 2: Stanza 37

						Attests the all-seeing sovereign of the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 3

						Then studious she prepares the choicest flour,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The strength of wheat and wines an ample store.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While to the rival train the prince returns,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The martial goddess with impatience burns;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With speed divine from street to street she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						She bids the mariners prepared to stand,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						When night descends, embodied on the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-

						Then to Noëmon swift she runs, she flies,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 37: Verse 12

			-
				Book 2: Stanza 38

						And now, declining with his sloping wheels,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Down sunk the sun behind the western hills
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And stow’d within its womb the naval stores,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full in the openings of the spacious main
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 38: Verse 6

					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next, to the court, impatient of delay.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With rapid step the goddess urged her way;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There every eye with slumberous chains she bound,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And dash’d the flowing goblet to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Reel’d from the palace, and retired to rest.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then thus, in Mentor’s reverend form array’d,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Lo! on the seas, prepared the vessel stands,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The impatient mariner thy speed demands.”
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The footsteps of the deity he treads.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Swift to the shore they move along the strand;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 39: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 40

						He bids them bring their stores; the attending train
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Load the tall bark, and launch into the main,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The prince and goddess to the stern ascend;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sable billows foam and roar below.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The chief his orders gives; the obedient band
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With due observance wait the chief’s command;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 11
				-
					-
						High o’er the roaring waves the spreading sails
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Bow the tall mast, and swell before the gales;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The crooked keel the parting surge divides,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And to the stern retreating roll the tides.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The holy goblet to the powers divine:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Imploring all the gods that reign above,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 40: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But chief the blue-eyed progeny of Jove.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 41: Verse 1

					-
						Thus all the night they stem the liquid way,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And end their voyage with the morning ray.

					-
						Through heaven’s eternal brazen portals blazed;

						There suppliant to the monarch of the flood,

						At nine green theatres the Pylians stood,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Each held five hundred (a deputed train),

						At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain.

						They taste the entrails, and the altars load

						With smoking thighs, an offering to the god.

						Full for the port the Ithacensians stand,

						And furl their sails, and issue on the land.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Telemachus already press’d the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Not first, the power of wisdom march’d before,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And ere the sacrificing throng he join’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Admonish’d thus his well-attending mind:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Proceed, my son! this youthful shame expel;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						An honest business never blush to tell.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						We pass’d the wide immeasurable main.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meet then the senior far renown’d for sense
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With reverend awe, but decent confidence:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sure he will; for wisdom never lies.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Oh tell me, Mentor! tell me, faithful guide
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The youth with prudent modesty replied),
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How shall I meet, or how accost the sage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unskill’d in speech, nor yet mature of age?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Awful th’approach, and hard the task appears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To question wisely men of riper years.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom the martial goddess thus rejoin’d:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Search, for some thoughts, thy own suggesting mind;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And others, dictated by heavenly power,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Born with good omens, and with heaven thy friend.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She spoke, and led the way with swiftest speed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						As swift, the youth pursued the way she led;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						and join’d the band before the sacred fire,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where sate, encompass’d with his sons, the sire.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Transfix’d the fragments, some prepared the food:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In friendly throngs they gather to embrace
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Along the shore the illustrious pair he led,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where Nestor sate with youthful Thrasymed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To each a portion of the feast he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And held the golden goblet foaming o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then first approaching to the elder guest,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The latent goddess in these words address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Whoe’er thou art, whom fortune brings to keep
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thee first it fits, O stranger! to prepare
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The due libation and the solemn prayer;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Though much thy younger, and his years like mine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						He too, I deem, implores the power divine;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						For all mankind alike require their grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						All born to want; a miserable race!”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He spake, and to her hand preferr’d the bowl;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A secret pleasure touch’d Athena’s soul,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To see the preference due to sacred age
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Regarded ever by the just and sage.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Of Ocean’s king she then implores the grace.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						“O thou! whose arms this ample globe embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Fulfil our wish, and let thy glory shine
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						On Nestor first, and Nestor’s royal line;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Next grant the Pylian states their just desires,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Pleased with their hecatomb’s ascending fires;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Last, deign Telemachus and me to bless,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And crown our voyage with desired success.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus she: and having paid the rite divine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Gave to Ulysses’ son the rosy wine.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Suppliant he pray’d. And now the victims dress’d
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They draw, divide, and celebrate the feast.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The banquet done, the narrative old man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus mild, the pleasing conference began:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Now gentle guests! the genial banquet o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						It fits to ask ye, what your native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And whence your race? on what adventure say,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thus far you wander through the watery way?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Relate if business, or the thirst of gain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Engage your journey o’er the pathless main
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The lives of others, venturous of their own.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Urged by the precepts by the goddess given,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And fill’d with confidence infused from Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The youth, whom Pallas destined to be wise
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And famed among the sons of men, replies:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Inquir’st thou, father! from what coast we came?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name!)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From where high Ithaca o’erlooks the floods,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Brown with o’er-arching shades and pendent woods
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Us to these shores our filial duty draws,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A private sorrow, not a public cause.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						My sire I seek, where’er the voice of fame
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Has told the glories of his noble name,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The great Ulysses; famed from shore to shore
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For valour much, for hardy suffering more.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Long time with thee before proud Ilion’s wall
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In arms he fought; with thee beheld her fall.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Of all the chiefs, this hero’s fate alone
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Has Jove reserved, unheard of, and unknown;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Whether in fields by hostile fury slain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Of this to learn, oppress’d with tender fears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Lo, at thy knee his suppliant son appears.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						If or thy certain eye, or curious ear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Have learnt his fate, the whole dark story clear
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And, oh! whate’er Heaven destined to betide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Let neither flattery soothe, nor pity hide.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Prepared I stand: he was but born to try
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The lot of man; to suffer, and to die.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Oh then, if ever through the ten years’ war
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The wise, the good Ulysses claim’d thy care;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						If e’er he join’d thy council, or thy sword,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						True in his deed, and constant to his word;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Far as thy mind through backward time can see
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Search all thy stores of faithful memory:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						’Tis sacred truth I ask, and ask of thee.”

			-
				Book 3: Stanza 9

						To him experienced Nestor thus rejoin’d:

				-
					-
						“O friend! what sorrows dost thou bring to mind!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Shall I the long, laborious scene review,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And open all the wounds of Greece anew?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Dauntless we roved; Achilles led the way;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What toils by land! where mix’d in fatal fight
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Such numbers fell, such heroes sunk to night;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There, too, my son—ah, once my best delight
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In whom stern courage with soft virtue join’d
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A faultless body and a blameless mind;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Antilochus—What more can I relate?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						How trace the tedious series of our fate?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Not added years on years my task could close,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The long historian of my country’s woes;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Back to thy native islands might’st thou sail,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And leave half-heard the melancholy tale.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nine painful years on that detested shore;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						What stratagems we form’d, what toils we bore!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Still labouring on, till scarce at last we found
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Great Jove propitious, and our conquest crown’d.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Far o’er the rest thy mighty father shined,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						In wit, in prudence, and in force of mind.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Art thou the son of that illustrious sire?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						With joy I grasp thee, and with love admire.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						So like your voices, and your words so wise,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Thy sire and I were one; nor varied aught
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						In public sentence, or in private thought;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 33

						Alike to council or the assembly came,

					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						With equal souls, and sentiments the same.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						But when (by wisdom won) proud Ilion burn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And in their ships the conquering Greeks return’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						’Twas God’s high will the victors to divide,
					-
				-

						And turn the event, confounding human pride;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 39

				-
					-
						(Not all were prudent, and not all were just).

				-
					-
						Stern daughter of the great avenger Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						The brother-kings inspired with fell debate;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Who call’d to council all the Achaian state,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						But call’d untimely (not the sacred rite
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Observed, nor heedful of the setting light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Nor herald sword the session to proclaim),
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Sour with debauch, a reeling tribe they came.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						To these the cause of meeting they explain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And Menelaus moves to cross the main;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Not so the king of men: he will’d to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 53

					-
						And calm Minerva’s wrath. Oh blind to fate!

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The gods not lightly change their love, or hate.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						With ireful taunts each other they oppose,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Now different counsels every breast divide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Each burns with rancour to the adverse side;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 60

					-
						(So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain’d).
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 61
				-
					-
						We with the rising morn our ships unmoor’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And brought our captives and our stores aboard;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 63
				-
					-
						But half the people with respect obey’d
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The king of men, and at his bidding stay’d.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 65

						Now on the wings of winds our course we keep

						(For God had smooth’d the waters of the deep);

						To bless our safe return, we join in prayer;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 70
				-
					-
						But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And raised new discord. Then (so Heaven decreed)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 72
				-

						Ulysses first and Nestor disagreed!

						Wise as he was, by various counsels sway’d,

						Warn’d of the coming fury of the gods.

						With us, Tydides fear’d, and urged his haste:

				-
					-
						And Menelaus came, but came the last,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 79
				-
					-
						He join’d our vessels in the Lesbian bay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 80
				-

						While yet we doubted of our watery way;

						If to the right to urge the pilot’s toil

				-

						And anchor under Mimas’ shaggy brow?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 85
				-
					-
						We sought direction of the power divine:

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The god propitious gave the guiding sign;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 88
				-
					-
						And in Euboea shun the woes we fear.

						Before the whistling winds the vessels fly,

						With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way,

						Yet what I learn’d, attend; as here I sat,

				-
					-
						And ask’d each voyager each hero’s fate;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 9: Verse 103

						With images, with garments, and with gold;

					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And the winds whistle, and the surges roll
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Mountains on mountains, and obscure the pole.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The tempest scatters, and divides our fleet;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Part, the storm urges on the coast of Crete,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Where winding round the rich Cydonian plain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The streams of Jardan issue to the main.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						There stands a rock, high, eminent and steep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Whose shaggy brow o’erhangs the shady deep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And views Gortyna on the western side;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 28
				-
					-
						On this rough Auster drove the impetuous tide:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With broken force the billows roll’d away,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And heaved the fleet into the neighb’ring bay.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Thus saved from death, they gain’d the Phæstan shores,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 32
				-
					-
						With shatter’d vessels and disabled oars;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 33
				-
					-
						But five tall barks the winds and water toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Far from their fellows, on the Ægyptian coast.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 35
				-
					-
						There wander’d Menelaus through foreign shores
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Amassing gold, and gathering naval stores;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 37
				-
					-
						While cursed Ægysthus the detested deed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 38
				-
					-
						By fraud fulfilled, and his great brother bled.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Seven years, the traitor rich Mycenae sway’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And his stern rule the groaning land obey’d;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The eighth, from Athens to his realm restored,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Orestes brandish’d the avenging sword,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Slew the dire pair, and gave to funeral flame
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The vile assassin and adulterous dame.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 45
				-
					-
						That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Return’d Atrides to the coast of Greece,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And safe to Argos port his navy brought,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 48
				-
					-
						With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Hence warn’d, my son, beware! nor idly stand
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Too long a stranger to thy native land;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 52
				-
					-
						While lawless feasters in thy palace away;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Perhaps may seize thy realm, and share the spoil;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And though return, with disappointed toil,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 55
				-
					-
						From thy vain journey, to a rifled isle.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 56
				-
					-
						However, my friend, indulge one labour more,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 58
				-
					-
						He, wandering long a wider circle made,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And many-languaged nations has survey’d:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And measured tracks unknown to other ships,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 62
				-
					-
						(A length of ocean and unbounded sky.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Which scarce the sea-fowl in a year o’erfly);
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Go then; to Sparta take the watery way,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Or, if my land then choose thy course to bend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 67
				-
					-
						My steeds, my chariots, and my songs, attend;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Guides of thy road, companions of thy way.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Urge him with truth to frame his wise replies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And sure he will; for Menelaus is wise.”
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And twilight grey her evening shade extends.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Then thus the blue-eyed maid: “O full of days!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Wise are thy words, and just are all thy ways.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Now immolate the tongues, and mix the wine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Sacred to Neptune and the powers divine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 78
				-
					-
						The lamp of day is quench’d beneath the deep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 16: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Timeless, indecent, but retire to rest.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spake Jove’s daughter, the celestial maid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The sober train attended and obey’d.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The sacred heralds on their hands around
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Pour’d the full urns; the youths the goblets crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						While to the final sacrifice they rose.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And pour, above, the consecrated stream.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And now, their thirst by copious draughts allay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The youthful hero and the Athenian maid
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Propose departure from the finish’d rite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And in their hollow bark to pass the night;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But this hospitable sage denied,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						“Forbid it, Jove! and all the gods! (he cried),
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thus from my walls and the much-loved son to send
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Of such a hero, and of such a friend!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Me, as some needy peasant, would ye leave,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Whom Heaven denies the blessing to relieve?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Me would ye leave, who boast imperial sway,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						When beds of royal state invite your stay?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						No—long as life this mortal shall inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Or as my children imitate their sire.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Here shall the wandering stranger find his home,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And hospitable rites adorn the dome.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Well hast thou spoke (the blue-eyed maid replies),
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Beloved old man! benevolent as wise.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Be the kind dictates of thy heart obey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And let thy words Telemachus persuade:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 6

						I to the ship, to give the orders due,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Prescribe directions and confirm the crew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For I alone sustain their naval cares,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who boast experience from these silver hairs;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						All youths the rest, whom to this journey move
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Like years, like tempers, and their prince’s love
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						There in the vessel shall I pass the night;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And, soon as morning paints the fields of light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						I go to challenge from the Caucons bold
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A debt, contracted in the days of old,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But this, thy guest, received with friendly care
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Let thy strong coursers swift to Sparta bear;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And be thy son companion of his way.”

			-
				Book 3: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then, turning with the word, Minerva flies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And soars an eagle through the liquid skies.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vision divine! the throng’d spectators gaze
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In holy wonder fix’d, and still amaze.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But chief the reverend sage admired; he took
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The hand of young Telemachus, and spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Oh, happy youth! and favoured of the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Distinguished care of guardian deities!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Whose early years for future worth engage,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						No vulgar manhood, no ignoble age.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For lo! none other of the course above,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then she, the daughter of almighty Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Pallas herself, the war-triumphant maid;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Confess’d is thine, as once thy father’s aid.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So guide me, goddess! so propitious shine
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						On me, my consort, and my royal line!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With ample forehead, and yet tender horns,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Whose budding honours ductile gold adorns.”
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Submissive thus the hoary sire preferr’d

						His holy vow: the favouring goddess heard.

						Then, slowly rising, o’er the sandy space

				-
					-
						(A long procession) timely marching home
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In comely order to the regal dome.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There when arrived, on thrones around him placed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His sons and grandsons the wide circle graced.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To these the hospitable sage, in sign
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of social welcome, mix’d the racy wine
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						(Late from the mellowing cask restored to light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						By ten long years refined, and rosy bright).
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To Pallas high the foaming bowl he crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And sprinkled large libations on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares,

					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And slept beneath the pompous colonnade;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Fast by his side Pisistratus was spread

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(In age his equal) on a splendid bed:

				-
					-
						But in an inner court, securely closed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 20: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The reverend Nestor and his queen reposed.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						When now Aurora, daughter of the dawn,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With rosy lustre purpled o’er the lawn,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The old man early rose, walk’d forth, and sate
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On polish’d stone before his palace gate;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where ancient Neleus sate, a rustic throne;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But he descending to the infernal shade,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Sage Nestor fill’d it, and the sceptre sway’d.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His sons around him mild obeisance pay,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And duteous take the orders of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						First Echephron and Stratius quit their bed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The last Pisistratus arose from rest:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						They came, and near him placed the stranger-guest.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To these the senior thus declared his will:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 16
				-
					-
						“My sons! the dictates of your sire fulfil.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To Pallas, first of gods, prepare the feast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Who graced our rites, a more than mortal guest
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Let one, despatchful, bid some swain to lead
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 20
				-
					-
						A well-fed bullock from the grassy mead;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 21
				-
					-
						One seek the harbour where the vessels moor,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And bring thy friends, Telemachus! ashore
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 23
				-
					-
						(Leave only two the galley to attend);
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Another Laerceus must we send,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Artist devine, whose skilful hands infold
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The victim’s horn with circumfusile gold.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The rest may here the pious duty share,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 21: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare,

						He said, and busy each his care bestow’d;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Already at the gates the bullock low’d,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Already came the Ithacensian crew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The dexterous smith the tools already drew;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His ponderous hammer and his anvil sound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And the strong tongs to turn the metal round.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor was Minerva absent from the rite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						She view’d her honours, and enjoyed the sight,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With reverend hand the king presents the gold,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Which round the intorted horns the gilder roll’d.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-

						Young Aretus from forth his bridal bower

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 13

						Brought the full laver, o’er their hands to pour,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And canisters of consecrated flour.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Stratius and Echephron the victim led;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In act to strike; before him Perseus stood,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The vase extending to receive the blood.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And the stream sprinkles; from the curling brows
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The hair collected in the fire he throws.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Soon as due vows on every part were paid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And sacred wheat upon the victim laid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Down sunk the heavy beast; the females round
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Maids, wives, and matrons, mix a shrilling sound.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 29

						(The first born she, of old Clymenus’ line:

						From earth they rear him, struggling now with death;

						The soul for ever flies; on all sides round

						On these, in double cauls involved with art,

						The choicest morsels lay from every part.

						The sacred sage before his altar stands,

					-
						Turns the burnt offering with his holy hands,

				-
					-
						The last fair branch of the Nestorean line,

				-
					-
						Sweet Polycaste, took the pleasing toil

				-

					-
						To bathe the prince, and pour the fragrant oil.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 51

						O’er his fair limbs a flowery vest he threw,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And issued, like a god, to mortal view.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 22: Verse 53

						The rage of thirst and hunger now suppress’d,

						The monarch turns him to his royal guest;
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And for the promised journey bids prepare

						With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew;

						Beneath the bounding yoke alike they hold

						But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,

						With rosy lustre purpled o’er the lawn,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Again they mount, their journey to renew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And from the sounding portico they flew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Along the waving fields their way they hold

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 10

					-
						The fields receding as their chariot roll’d;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light,

						With double vows invoking Hymen’s power,

						The monarch took the word, and grave replied:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Presumptuous are the vaunts, and vain the pride
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of man, who dares in pomp with Jove contest,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unchanged, immortal, and supremely blest!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With all my affluence, when my woes are weigh’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Envy will own the purchase dearly paid.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For eight slow-circling years, by tempests toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From Cypress to the far Phoenician coast
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(Sidon the capital), I stretch’d my toil
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Through regions fatten’d with the flows of Nile.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Next Aethiopia’s utmost bound explore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the parch’d borders of the Arabian shore;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then warp my voyage on the southern gales,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						O’er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						That happy clime, where each revolving year
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And two fair crescents of translucent horn
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The brows of all their young increase adorn:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The shepherd swains, with sure abundance blest,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						On the fat flock and rural dainties feast;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail,

						Whilst, heaping unwash’d wealth, I distant roam,

				-
					-
						The best of brothers, at his natal home,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						By the dire fury of a traitress wife,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Ends the sad evening of a stormy life;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Whence, with incessant grief my soul annoy’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						These riches are possess’d, but not enjoy’d!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-

						My wars, the copious theme of every tongue,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To you your fathers have recorded long.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						How favouring Heaven repaid my glorious toils
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						With a sack’d palace, and barbaric spoils.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Oh! had the gods so large a boon denied
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And life, the just equivalent supplied
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						To those brave warriors, who, with glory fired
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Far from their country, in my cause expired!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Still in short intervals of pleasing woe.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Regardful of the friendly dues I owe,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						I to the glorious dead, for ever dear!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						But oh! Ulysses—deeper than the rest
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						That sad idea wounds my anxious breast!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						My heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Nor sleep’s soft power can close my streaming eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-

						When imaged to my soul his sorrows rise.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						No peril in my cause he ceased to prove,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						His labours equall’d only by my love:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And both alike to bitter fortune born,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						For him to suffer, and for me to mourn!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Whether he wanders on some friendly coast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Or glides in Stygian gloom a pensive ghost,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						No fame reveals; but, doubtful of his doom,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						His good old sire with sorrow to the tomb
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Declines his trembling steps; untimely care
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Withers the blooming vigour of his heir;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And the chaste partner of his bed and throne
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Wastes all her widow’d hours in tender moan.”

					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus pathetic to the prince he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From the brave youth the streaming passion broke;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Studious to veil the grief, in vain repress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His face he shrouded with his purple vest.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And view’d his filial love with vast surprise:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Dubious to press the tender theme, or wait
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To hear the youth inquire his father’s fate.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In this suspense bright Helen graced the room;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So moves, adorn’d with each attractive grace,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The silver shafted goddess of the chase!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The seat of majesty Adraste brings,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With art illustrious, for the pomp of kings;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To spread the pall (beneath the regal chair)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Of softest wool, is bright Alcippe’s care.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A silver canister, divinely wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In her soft hands the beauteous Phylo brought;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To Sparta’s queen of old the radiant vase
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Alcandra gave, a pledge of royal grace;

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For Polybus her lord (whose sovereign sway

						The wealthy tribes of Pharian Thebes obey),
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						When to that court Atrides came, caress’d
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						With vast munificence the imperial guest:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Two lavers from the richest ore refined,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						With silver tripods, the kind host assign’d;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And bounteous from the royal treasure told
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Ten equal talents of refulgent gold.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Alcandra, consort of his high command,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						A golden distaff gave to Helen’s hand;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And that rich vase, with living sculpture wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Which heap’d with wool the beauteous Phylo brought
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The silken fleece, impurpled for the loom,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Rivall’d the hyacinth in vernal bloom.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The sovereign seat then Jove born Helen press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 10: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And pleasing thus her sceptred lord address’d:

						Uncertain of the truth, yet uncontroll’d,

				-
					-
						What time the Greeks combined their social arms,

				-
					-
						Why did you fear to trouble my repose?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 59: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He either had obey’d my fond desire,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 59: Verse 14

						Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire.

						Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave

						To tend the fruit groves: with incessant speed

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 59: Verse 18
				-

						He shall this violence of death decreed

						To good Laertes tell. Experienced age

						Then Euryclea thus: “My dearest dread;

				-
					-
						Though to the sword I bow this hoary head,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Or if a dungeon be the pain decreed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I own me conscious of the unpleasing deed;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Auxiliar to his flight, my aid implored,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With wine and viands I the vessel stored;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 7

					-
						A solemn oath, imposed, the secret seal’d,

					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 8
				-

						Till the twelfth dawn the light of day reveal’d.

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 9

						Dreading the effect of a fond mother’s fear,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He dared not violate your royal ear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But bathe, and, in imperial robes array’d,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pay due devotions to the martial maid,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And rest affianced in her guardian aid.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 14
				-

						Send not to good Laertes, nor engage

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In toils of state the miseries of age:

					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Tis impious to surmise the powers divine
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To ruin doom the Jove-descended line;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 60: Verse 19

						And isles remote enlarge his old domain.”
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 61
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The queen her speech with calm attention hears,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Her eyes restrain the silver-streaming tears:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 3
				-
					-
						She bathes, and robed, the sacred dome ascends;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Her pious speed a female train attends:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The salted cakes in canisters are laid,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 61: Verse 6

			-
				Book 4: Stanza 62
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 62: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Daughter divine of Jove, whose arm can wield

				-
					-
						The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 62: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If e’er Ulysses to thy fane preferr’d

					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 63
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 63: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She ceased; shrill ecstasies of joy declare
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 63: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The favouring goddess present to the prayer;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 63: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The suitors heard, and deem’d the mirthful voice
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 63: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A signal of her hymeneal choice;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 63: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board:
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 64
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 64: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Too late the queen selects a second lord;

				-
					-
						In evil hour the nuptial rite intends,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						When o’er her son disastrous death impends.”
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 64: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thus he, unskill’d of what the fates provide!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 64: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But with severe rebuke Antinous cried:
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 65
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 2

					-
						Alarm not with discourse the menial train:

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The great event with silent hope attend,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Our deeds alone our counsel must commend.”
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where anchor’d in the bay the vessel rides,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Replete with mail and military store,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In all her tackle trim to quit the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 65: Verse 11

						The desperate crew ascend, unfurl the sails

						(The seaward prow invites the tardy gales);

					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In her sad breast the prince’s fortunes roll,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 4

					-
						And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So when the woodman’s toil her cave surrounds,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And with the hunter’s cry the grove resounds,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With grief and rage the mother-lion stung,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 8

						Fearless herself, yet trembles for her young,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 9
				-
					-
						While pensive in the silent slumberous shade,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Sleep’s gentle powers her drooping eyes invade;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Minerva, life-like, on embodied air
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 66: Verse 12

					-
						(Icarius’ daughter she, whose blooming charms

						Who, in a league of blood associates sworn,

					-
						What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may’st restore
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The son in safety to his native shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						While the fell foes, who late in ambush lay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With fraud defeated measure back their way.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus to Hermes the command was given:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Hermes, thou chosen messenger of heaven!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Go, to the nymph be these our orders borne
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Tis Jove’s decree, Ulysses shall return:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The patient man shall view his old abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor helped by mortal hand, nor guiding gods
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Alone, and floating to the wave and wind.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The bold Phæacians there, whose haughty line
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Is mixed with gods, half human, half divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The chief shall honour as some heavenly guest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And swift transport him to his place of rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His vessels loaded with a plenteous store
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent ore
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						(A richer prize than if his joyful isle

					-
						Received him charged with Ilion’s noble spoil),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 17

					-
						His friends, his country, he shall see, though late:

					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 18

						Such is our sovereign will, and such is fate.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke. The god who mounts the winged winds
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						That high through fields of air his flight sustain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O’er the wide earth, and o’er the boundless main:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then shoots from heaven to high Pieria’s steep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So watery fowl, that seek their fishy food,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With wings expanded o’er the foaming flood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now dip their pinions in the briny deep;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thus o’er the world of waters Hermes flew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Till now the distant island rose in view:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then, swift ascending from the azure wave,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He took the path that winded to the cave.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Large was the grot, in which the nymph he found
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						(The fair-hair’d nymph with every beauty crown’d).
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The cave was brighten’d with a rising blaze;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Cedar and frankincense, an odorous pile,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Flamed on the hearth, and wide perfumed the isle;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						While she with work and song the time divides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And through the loom the golden shuttle guides.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Without the grot a various sylvan scene
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Appear’d around, and groves of living green;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Poplars and alders ever quivering play’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And nodding cypress form’d a fragrant shade:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						On whose high branches, waving with the storm,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The birds of broadest wing their mansions form,—
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,—
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						and scream aloft, and skim the deeps below.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Depending vines the shelving cavern screen.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						With purple clusters blushing through the green.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Four limped fountains from the clefts distil:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And every fountain pours a several rill,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						In mazy windings wandering down the hill:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And glowing violets threw odours round.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						A god might gaze, and wander with delight!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Joy touch’d the messenger of heaven: he stay’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Him, entering in the cave, Calypso knew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						For powers celestial to each other’s view
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Stand still confess’d, though distant far they lie
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						To habitants of earth, or sea, or sky.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						But sad Ulysses, by himself apart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Pour’d the big sorrows of his swelling heart;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						All on the lonely shore he sate to weep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And roll’d his eyes around the restless deep:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Toward his loved coast he roll’d his eyes in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Till, dimm’d with rising grief, they stream’d again.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now graceful seated on her shining throne,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“God of the golden wand! on what behest
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Arrivest thou here, an unexpected guest?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Loved as thou art, thy free injunctions lay;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Tis mine with joy and duty to obey.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till now a stranger, in a happy hour
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Approach, and taste the dainties of my bower.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Ambrosial cates, with nectar rosy-red);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Hermes the hospitable rite partook,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Divine refection! then, recruited, spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What moves this journey from my native sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A goddess asks, nor can a god deny.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Hear then the truth. By mighty Jove’s command
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Unwilling have I trod this pleasing land:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For who, self-moved, with weary wing would sweep
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such length of ocean and unmeasured deep;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A world of waters! far from all the ways
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But to Jove’s will submission we must pay;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						What power so great to dare to disobey?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A man, he says, a man resides with thee,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of all his kind most worn with misery.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The Greeks, (whose arms for nine long year employ’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Their force on Ilion, in the tenth destroy’d,)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						At length, embarking in a luckless hour,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With conquest proud, incensed Minerva’s power:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With storms pursued them through the liquid world.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						There all his dear companions found their grave!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Saved from the jaws of death by Heaven’s decree,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The tempest drove him to these shores and thee.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Him, Jove now orders to his native lands
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Straight to dismiss: so destiny commands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Impatient Fate his near return attends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And calls him to his country, and his friends.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						E’en to her inmost soul the goddess shook;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then thus her anguish, and her passion broke:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Ungracious gods! with spite and envy cursed!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Still to your own ethereal race the worst!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Ye envy mortal and immortal joy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And love, the only sweet of life destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Did ever goddess by her charms engage
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A favour’d mortal, and not feel your rage?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So when Aurora sought Orion’s love,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Till, in Ortygia Dian’s winged dart
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So when the covert of the thrice-eared field
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But Jove’s swift lightning scorched him in her arms.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Am I the envy of your blissful bowers?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A man, an outcast to the storm and wave,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						It was my crime to pity, and to save;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When he who thunders rent his bark in twain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And sunk his brave companions in the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Alone, abandon’d, in mid-ocean tossed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The sport of winds, and driven from every coast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Hither this man of miseries I led,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Received the friendless, and the hungry fed;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Immortal life, exempt from age and woe.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						’Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Go then he must (he must, if he ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						But never, never shall Calypso send
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						To toils like these her husband and her friend.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						What ships have I, what sailors to convey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						What oars to cut the long laborious way?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Yet I’ll direct the safest means to go;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						That last advice is all I can bestow.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To her the power who hears the charming rod;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Dismiss the man, nor irritate the god;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Prevent the rage of him who reigns above,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove?”
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And in a moment vanished from her eye,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The nymph, obedient to divine command,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And inly pining for his native shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For now the soft enchantress pleased no more;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Absent he lay in her desiring arms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In slumber wore the heavy night away,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						There sate all desolate, and sighed alone,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And roll’d his eyes o’er all the restless main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Till, dimmed with rising grief, they streamed again.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Here, on his musing mood the goddess press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Approaching soft, and thus the chief address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						No more in sorrows languish life away:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Free as the winds I give thee now to rove:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And form a raft, and build the rising ship,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Sublime to bear thee o’er the gloomy deep.

				-
					-
						To store the vessel let the care be mine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With water from the rock and rosy wine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And life-sustaining bread, and fair array,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These, if the gods with my desire comply
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(The gods, alas, more mighty far than I,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And better skill’d in dark events to come),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In peace shall land thee at thy native home.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then thus his melancholy silence broke:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Some other motive, goddess! sways thy mind
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Some close design, or turn of womankind),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor my return the end, nor this the way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The bold proposal how shall I fulfil,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Swear, then, thou mean’st not what my soul forebodes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso eyed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And gently grasp’d his hand, and thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And learn’d in all the wiles of human thought,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How prone to doubt, how cautious, are the wise!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But hear, O earth, and hear, ye sacred skies!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And thou, O Styx! whose formidable floods
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Glide through the shades, and bind the attesting gods!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						No form’d design, no meditated end,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The same my practice, were my fate the same.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But given the sense to pity, and to feel.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus having said, the goddess marched before:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At the cool cave arrived, they took their state;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He filled the throne where Mercury had sate.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For him the nymph a rich repast ordains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Such as the mortal life of man sustains;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Before herself were placed the the cates divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Is then thy home the passion of thy heart?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Nor break the transport with one thought of me.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And e’en these slighted charms might learn to please.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A willing goddess, and immortal life,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Might banish from thy mind an absent wife.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Am I inferior to a mortal dame?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Less soft my feature less august my frame?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or shall the daughters of mankind compare
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Alas! for this (the prudent man replies)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Forgive the weakness of a human heart.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Though well I see thy graces far above
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The dear, though mortal, object of my love,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Of youth eternal well the difference know,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the short date of fading charms below;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Yet every day, while absent thus I roam,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						I languish to return and die at home.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whate’er the gods shall destine me to bear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In the black ocean or the watery war,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						’Tis mine to master with a constant mind;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Inured to perils, to the worst resign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						By seas, by wars, so many dangers run;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Still I can suffer; their high will he done!”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And rising night her friendly shade extends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To the close grot the lonely pair remove,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And slept delighted with the gifts of love.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When rosy morning call’d them from their rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The nymph’s fair head a veil transparent graced,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						In snowy waves flow’d glittering on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A weighty axe with truest temper steeled,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Wrought of the clouded olive’s easy grain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then to the neighboring forest led the way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						On the lone island’s utmost verge there stood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Scorch’d by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(Already dried). These pointing out to view,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The nymph just show’d him, and with tears withdrew.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now toils the hero: trees on trees o’erthrown
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And lopp’d and lighten’d of their branchy load.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At equal angles these disposed to join,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He smooth’d and squared them by the rule and line,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(The wimbles for the work Calypso found)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Long and capacious as a shipwright forms
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Some bark’s broad bottom to out-ride the storms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						So large he built the raft; then ribb’d it strong
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From space to space, and nail’d the planks along;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These form’d the sides: the deck he fashion’d last;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Then o’er the vessel raised the taper mast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And to the helm the guiding rudder join’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						(With yielding osiers fenced, to break the force
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of surging waves, and steer the steady course).
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thy loom, Calypso, for the future sails
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Supplied the cloth, capacious of the gales.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 18: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And, roll’d on levers, launch’d her in the deep.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Four days were pass’d, and now the work complete,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shone the fifth morn, when from her sacred seat
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The nymph dismiss’d him (odorous garments given),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then fill’d two goatskins with her hands divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With water one, and one with sable wine:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Of every kind, provisions heaved aboard;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And the full decks with copious viands stored.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The goddess, last, a gentle breeze supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now, rejoicing in the prosperous gales,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Placed at the helm he sate, and mark’d the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There view’d the Pleiads, and the Northern Team,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And great Orion’s more refulgent beam.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To which, around the axle of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far on the left those radiant fires to keep
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The nymph directed, as he sail’d the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The distant land appear’d the following day:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then swell’d to sight Phæacia’s dusky coast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And woody mountains, half in vapours lost;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That lay before him indistinct and vast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Like a broad shield amid the watery waste.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But him, thus voyaging the deeps below,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From far, on Solyme’s aërial brow,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king of ocean saw, and seeing burn’d
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(From Æthiopia’s happy climes return’d);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The raging monarch shook his azure head,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus in secret to his soul he said:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“Heavens! how uncertain are the powers on high!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Is then reversed the sentence of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In one man’s favour; while a distant guest
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 10
				-
					-
						I shared secure the Æthiopian feast?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Behold how near Phæacia’s land he draws;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The land affix’d by Fate’s eternal laws
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To end his toils. Is then our anger vain?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 21: Verse 14
				-
					-
						No; if this sceptre yet commands the main.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and high the forky trident hurl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the watery world,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At once the face of earth and sea deforms,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swells all the winds, and rouses all the storms.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Down rushed the night: east, west, together roar;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And south and north roll mountains to the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then shook the hero, to despair resign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And question’d thus his yet unconquer’d mind;
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Wretch that I am! what farther fates attend
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						This life of toils, and what my destined end?
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Too well, alas! the island goddess knew
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On the black sea what perils should ensue.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						New horrors now this destined head inclose;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Untill’d is yet the measure of my woes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With what a cloud the brows of heaven are crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						What raging winds! what roaring waters round!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						’Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Death, present death, on every side appears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Happy! thrice happy! who, in battle slain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Press’d in Atrides’ cause the Trojan plain!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Oh! had I died before that well-fought wall!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Had some distinguish’d day renown’d my fall
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 15
				-
					-
						(Such as was that when showers of javelins fled
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 16
				-
					-
						From conquering Troy around Achilles dead),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 17
				-
					-
						All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And spread my glory with the sons of men.

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A shameful fate now hides my hapless head,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 23: Verse 20

						Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 1

					-
						A mighty wave rush’d o’er him as he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The raft is cover’d, and the mast is broke;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While by the howling tempest rent in twain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o’er the main.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Long-press’d, he heaved beneath the weighty wave,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Clogg’d by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 9
				-
					-
						At length, emerging, from his nostrils wide
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And gushing mouth effused the briny tide;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						E’en then not mindless of his last retreat,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He seized the raft, and leap’d into his seat,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Strong with the fear of death. In rolling flood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, impell’d the floating wood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						As when a heap of gather’d thorns is cast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Now to, now fro, before the autumnal blast;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Together clung, it rolls around the field;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						So roll’d the float, and so its texture held:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And now the south, and now the north, bear sway,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And now the east the foamy floods obey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And now the west wind whirls it o’er the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The wandering chief with toils on toils oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Leucothea saw, and pity touch’d her breast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 24
				-
					-
						(Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus’ strain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But now an azure sister of the main)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Swift as a sea-mew springing from the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 27
				-
					-
						All radiant on the raft the goddess stood;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then thus address’d him: “Thou whom heaven decrees
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 29
				-
					-
						To Neptune’s wrath, stern tyrant of the seas!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 30
				-
					-
						(Unequal contest!) not his rage and power,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Great as he is, such virtue shall devour.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 32
				-
					-
						What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Strip off thy garments; Neptune’s fury brave
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 35
				-
					-
						With naked strength, and plunge into the wave.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 36
				-
					-
						To reach Phæacia all thy nerves extend,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 37
				-
					-
						There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 38
				-
					-
						This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And live; give all thy terrors to the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Return the gift, and cast it in the main:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Observe my orders, and with heed obey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 24: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A moment snatch’d the shining form away,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And all was covered with the curling sea.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclined,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He stands suspended, and explores his mind:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“What shall I do? unhappy me! who knows
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But other gods intend me other woes?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whoe’er thou art, I shall not blindly join
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For scarce in ken appears that distant isle
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The wild waves’ fury, here I fix’d remain:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But, when their texture to the tempest yields,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						I launch adventurous on the liquid fields,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Join to the help of gods the strength of man,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And take this method, since the best I can.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The raging god a watery mountain roll’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Burst o’er the float, and thunder’d on his head.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Planks, beams, disparted fly; the scatter’d wood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Rolls diverse, and in fragments strews the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So the rude Boreas, o’er the field new-shorn,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Tosses and drives the scatter’d heaps of corn.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And now a single beam the chief bestrides:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						There poised a while above the bounding tides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And binds the sacred cincture round his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then prone an ocean in a moment flung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Stretch’d wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						All naked now, on heaving billows laid,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 27: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Stern Neptune eyed him, and contemptuous said:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Go, learn’d in woes, and other foes essay!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Go, wander helpless on the watery way;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whate’er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shall last remember’d in thy best of days.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And reach high Ægæ and the towery dome.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce earth-shaking power,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Jove’s daughter Pallas watch’d the favouring hour.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And hush’d the blustering brethren of the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The drier blasts alone of Boreas away,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bear him soft on broken waves away;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With gentle force impelling to that shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Where fate has destined he shall toil no more.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And now, two nights, and now two days were pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Since wide he wander’d on the watery waste;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Heaved on the surge with intermitting breath,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And hourly panting in the arms of death.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The third fair morn now blazed upon the main;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The winds were hush’d, the billows scarcely curl’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And a dead silence still’d the watery world;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The land at distance, and with sharpen’d eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 21
				-
					-
						As pious children joy with vast delight
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 22
				-
					-
						When a loved sire revives before their sight
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 23
				-
					-
						(Who, lingering long, has call’d on death in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Fix’d by some demon to his bed of pain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Till heaven by miracle his life restore);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 26
				-
					-
						So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And sees (and labours onward as he sees)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The rising forests, and the tufted trees.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And now, as near approaching as the sound
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Of human voice the listening ear may wound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 34
				-
					-
						To shield the vessel from the rolling sea,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 35
				-
					-
						But cliffs and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 36
				-
					-
						All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Fear seized his slacken’d limbs and beating heart,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 29: Verse 38
				-
					-
						As thus he communed with his soul apart;
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Ah me! when, o’er a length of waters toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						These eyes at last behold the unhoped-for coast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						No port receives me from the angry main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But the loud deeps demand me back again.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						No footing sure affords the faithless sand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						If here I enter, my efforts are vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Dash’d on the cliffs, or heaved into the main;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or round the island if my course I bend,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where the ports open, or the shores descend,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And bury all my hopes beneath the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or some enormous whale the god may send
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(For many such an Amphitrite attend);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Too well the turns of mortal chance I know,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And hate relentless of my heavenly foe.”
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 19
				-
					-
						While thus he thought, a monstrous wave upbore
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The chief, and dash’d him on the craggy shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But Instant Pallas enter’d in his soul.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And stuck adherent, and suspended hung;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Till the huge surge roll’d off; then backward sweep
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The refluent tides, and plunge him in the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 27
				-
					-
						As when the polypus, from forth his cave
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 30
				-
					-
						So the rough rock had shagg’d Ulysses hands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And now had perish’d, whelm’d beneath the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The unhappy man; e’en fate had been in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 33
				-
					-
						But all-subduing Pallas lent her power,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And prudence saved him in the needful hour.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 35
				-

						Beyond the beating surge his course he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 36
				-
					-
						(A wider circle, but in sight of shore),
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 37
				-
					-
						With longing eyes, observing, to survey
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Some smooth ascent, or safe sequester’d bay.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Between the parting rocks at length he spied
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 40
				-
					-
						A failing stream with gentler waters glide;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Where to the seas the shelving shore declined,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And form’d a bay impervious to the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 43
				-
					-
						To this calm port the glad Ulysses press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 30: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And hail’d the river, and its god address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whoe’er thou art, before whose stream unknown
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To thee from Neptune and the raging main
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For sacred even to gods is misery:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Let then thy waters give the weary rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And save a suppliant, and a man distress’d.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He pray’d, and straight the gentle stream subsides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Detains the rushing current of his tides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Before the wanderer smooths the watery way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And soft receives him from the rolling sea.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That moment, fainting as he touch’d the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He dropp’d his sinewy arms: his knees no more
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Perform’d their office, or his weight upheld:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His swoln heart heaved; his bloated body swell’d:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And lost in lassitude lay all the man,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Deprived of voice, of motion, and of breath;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The soul scarce waking in the arms of death.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Soon as warm life its wonted office found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The mindful chief Leucothea’s scarf unbound;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Observant of her word, he turn’d aside
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His head, and cast it on the rolling tide.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Behind him far, upon the purple waves,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 32: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The waters waft it, and the nymph receives.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown’d;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The bank he press’d, and gently kiss’d the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus to his soul the sage began to say:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What will ye next ordain, ye powers on high!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thus spent already, how shall nature bear
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The dews descending, and nocturnal air;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When morning rises?—If I take the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Though fenced from cold, and though my toil be pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What savage beasts may wander in the waste?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To prowling bears, or lions in the way.”
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus long debating in himself he stood:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At length he took the passage to the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whose shady horrors on a rising brow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Waved high, and frown’d upon the stream below.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There grew two olives, closest of the grove,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With roots entwined, the branches interwove;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With sister-fruits; one fertile, one was wild.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor here the sun’s meridian rays had power,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor wind sharp-piercing, nor the rushing shower;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The verdant arch so close its texture kept:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Beneath this covert great Ulysses crept.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Of gather’d leaves an ample bed he made
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade);
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Where three at least might winter’s cold defy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 17
				-
					-
						This store with joy the patient hero found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And, sunk amidst them, heap’d the leaves around.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 19
				-
					-
						As some poor peasant, fated to reside
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Remote from neighbours in a forest wide,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Studious to save what human wants require,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In embers heap’d, preserves the seeds of fire:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Till Pallas pour’d soft slumbers on his eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 35: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Lull’d all his cares, and banish’d all his woes.
					-
		-
			Book 6
		-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The martial maid from heaven’s aërial height
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Swift to Phæacia wing’d her rapid flight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In elder times the soft Phæacian train
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In ease possess’d the wide Hyperian plain;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A lawless nation of gigantic foes;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Through seas retreating from the sounds of war,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The recreant nation to fair Scheria led,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where never science rear’d her laurell’d head;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Now in the silent grave the monarch lay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And wise Alcinous held the legal sway.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To his high palace through the fields of air
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The goddess shot; Ulysses was her care.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There, as the night in silence roll’d away,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Light as the viewless air the warrior maid
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Glides through the valves, and hovers round her head;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A favourite virgin’s blooming form she took,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And sleep’st thou careless of the bridal day!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy spousal ornament neglected lies;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A just applause the cares of dress impart,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And give soft transport to a parent’s heart.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Haste to the stream! companion of thy care,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Virgin, awake! the marriage hour is nigh,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The royal car at early dawn obtain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And order mules obedient to the rein;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Where their fair vests Phæacian virgins lave,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And majesty derives a grace from state.”
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then to the palaces of heaven she sails,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The seat of gods; the regions mild of peace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Full joy, and calm eternity of ease.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						There no rude winds presume to shake the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But on immortal thrones the blest repose;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The firmament with living splendours glows.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Hither the goddess winged the aërial way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Through heaven’s eternal gates that blazed with day.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now from her rosy car Aurora shed
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The dawn, and all the orient flamed with red.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Up rose the virgin with the morning light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Obedient to the vision of the night.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The queen she sought, the queen her hours bestowed
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In curious works; the whirling spindle glow’d
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With crimson threads, while busy damsels call
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Meanwhile Phæacia’s peers in council sate;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						From his high dome the king descends in state;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then with a filial awe the royal maid
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Approach’d him passing, and submissive said:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And may his child the royal car obtain?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Say, with my garments shall I bend my way?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where through the vales the mazy waters stray?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A dignity of dress adorns the great,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And spotless robes become the young and gay;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So when with praise amid the dance they shine,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By these my cares adorn’d that praise is mine.”
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus she: but blushes ill-restrain’d betray
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The conscious sire the dawning blush survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, smiling, thus bespoke the blooming maid
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“My child, my darling joy, the car receive;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That, and whate’er our daughter asks, we give.”
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Swift at the royal nod the attending train
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The car prepare, the mules incessant rein,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The blooming virgin with despatchful cares
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The queen, assiduous to her train assigns
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The train prepare a cruse of curious mould,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A cruse of fragrance, form’d of burnish’d gold;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains
					-

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With majesty enlarged, and air divine:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						As by some artist, to whom Vulcan gives
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His skill divine, a breathing statue lives;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And o’er the silver pours the fusile gold
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So Pallas his heroic frame improves
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With heavenly bloom, and like a god he moves.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A fragrance breathes around; majestic grace
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Attends his steps: the astonished virgins gaze.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The wondering nymph his glorious port survey’d,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And to her damsels, with amazement, said:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Not without care divine the stranger treads
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						This land of joy; his steps some godhead leads:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Would Jove destroy him, sure he had been driven
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Far from this realm, the favourite isle of heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Late, a sad spectacle of woe, he trod
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The desert sands, and now he looks a god.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Oh heaven! in my connubial hour decree
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						This man my spouse, or such a spouse as he!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But haste, the viands and the bowl provide.”
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The maids the viands and the bowl supplied:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Eager he fed, for keen his hunger raged,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And with the generous vintage thirst assuaged.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now on return her care Nausicaa bends,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The robes resumes, the glittering car ascends,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Far blooming o’er the field; and as she press’d
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The splendid seat, the listening chief address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Stranger, arise! the sun rolls down the day.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Lo, to the palace I direct thy way;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where, in high state, the nobles of the land
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Attend my royal sire, a radiant band
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But hear, though wisdom in thy soul presides,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Speaks from thy tongue, and every action guides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Advance at distance, while I pass the plain
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where o’er the furrows waves the golden grain;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Alone I reascend—With airy mounds
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A strength of wall the guarded city bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The jutting land two ample bays divides:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The spacious basons arching rocks enclose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A sure defence from every storm that blows.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Close to the bay great Neptune’s fane adjoins;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And near, a forum flank’d with marble shines,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To give the feather’d arrow wings to kill;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But the tall mast above the vessel rear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						They rush into the deep with eager joy,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Climb the steep surge, and through the tempest fly;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 25
				-
					-
						A proud, unpolish’d race—To me belongs
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 29
				-
					-
						‘What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Heavens, with what graceful majesty he treads!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Perhaps a native of some distant shore,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The future consort of her bridal hour:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Or rather some descendant of the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Won by her prayer, the aërial bridegroom flies,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Heaven on that hour its choicest influence shed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 36
				-
					-
						That gave a foreign spouse to crown her bed!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 37
				-
					-
						All, all the godlike worthies that adorn
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 38
				-
					-
						This realm, she flies: Phæacia is her scorn.’
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And just the blame: for female innocence
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Not only flies the guilt, but shuns the offence:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The unguarded virgin, as unchaste, I blame;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And the least freedom with the sex is shame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Till our consenting sires a spouse provide,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And public nuptials justify the bride,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 45
				-
					-
						But would’st thou soon review thy native plain?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Attend, and speedy thou shalt pass the main:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 48
				-
					-
						To Pallas sacred, shades the holy ground,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 49
				-
					-
						We bend our way; a bubbling fount distills
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 50
				-
					-
						A lucid lake, and thence descends in rills;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Around the grove, a mead with lively green
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Falls by degrees, and forms a beauteous scene;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And there the garden yields a waste of flowers.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Hence lies the town, as far as to the ear
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Floats a strong shout along the waves of air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 57
				-
					-
						There wait embower’d, while I ascend alone
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 58
				-
					-
						To great Alcinous on his royal throne.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Arrived, advance, impatient of delay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And to the lofty palace bend thy way:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The lofty palace overlooks the town,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 62
				-
					-
						From every dome by pomp superior known;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 63
				-
					-
						A child may point the way. With earnest gait
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Seek thou the queen along the rooms of state;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Her royal hand a wondrous work designs,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Around a circle of bright damsels shines;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Part twist the threads, and part the wool dispose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 68
				-
					-
						While with the purple orb the spindle glows.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 69
				-
					-
						High on a throne, amid the Scherian powers,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 70
				-
					-
						My royal father shares the genial hours:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 71
				-
					-
						But to the queen thy mournful tale disclose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 72
				-
					-
						With the prevailing eloquence of woes:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 73
				-
					-
						So shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 22: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Though mountains rise between and oceans roar.”
					-

				Book 6: Stanza 23
			-

					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-

						She added not, but waving, as she wheel’d,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The silver scourge, it glitter’d o’er the field;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With skill the virgin guides the embroider’d rein,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Slow rolls the car before the attending train,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now whirling down the heavens, the golden day
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shot through the western clouds a dewy ray;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The grove they reach, where, from the sacred shade,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To Pallas thus the pensive hero pray’d:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Daughter of Jove! whose arms in thunder wield
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Forsook by thee, in vain I sought thy aid
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						When booming billows closed above my bead;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Attend, unconquer’d maid! accord my vows,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Bid the Great hear, and pitying, heal my woes.”
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This heard Minerva, but forbore to fly

					Book 6: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(By Neptune awed) apparent from the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Stern god! who raged with vengeance, unrestrain’d.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 25: Verse 4

						Till great Ulysses hail’d his native land.

						While the slow mules draws on the imperial maid;

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 3

						Through the proud street she moves, the public gaze;

						Now worn with age, Eurymedusa named;

					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The captive dame Phæacian rovers bore,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 12

						Snatch’d from Epirus, her sweet native shore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(A grateful prize), and in her bloom bestow’d
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 14

						On good Alcinous, honor’d as a god;

						Nurse of Nausicaa from her infant years,

						Now from the sacred thicket where he lay,

				-

						Propitious Pallas, to secure her care,

					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-

						Around him spread a veil of thicken’d air;

					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To shun the encounter of the vulgar crowd,

					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 6

						Insulting still, inquisitive and loud.

						The beauteous city opening to his view,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 9

						His step a virgin met, and stood before:

					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A polish’d urn the seeming virgin bore,

						And youthful smiled; but in the low disguise

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 12

						With question needless, or inquiry vain;

						A race of ragged mariners are these,

						These did the ruler of the deep ordain
					-

						To build proud navies, and command the main;

						In separate islands, crown’d with rising spires;

						The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,

					-
						In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o’er,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 13: Verse 6

					-
						With darkness circled, and an ambient cloud.

						Direct to great Alcinous’ throne he came,

					-
						And prostrate fell before the imperial dame.

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then from around him dropp’d the veil of night;

						Sudden he shines, and manifest to sight.

						Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore:

						When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps

						Herself supplied the stores and rich array,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 31

						For angry Neptune roused the raging main;

						Soon as their rage subsides, the seas I brave

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With naked force, and shoot along the wave,

						I chose the safer sea, and chanced to find
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 44
				-
					-
						A river’s mouth impervious to the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 47
				-
					-
						’Twas night, and, covered in the foliage deep,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 49
				-
					-
						All night I slept, oblivious of my pain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Aurora dawned and Phœbus shined in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Nor, till oblique he sloped his evening ray,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Then female voices from the shore I heard:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 54
				-
					-
						A maid amidst them, goddess-like appear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 55
				-
					-
						To her I sued, she pitied my distress;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Who from such youth could hope considerate care?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 58
				-
					-
						In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 59
				-
					-
						She gave me life, relieved with just supplies
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 23: Verse 60
				-
					-
						My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes.

					-
						This is the truth: and oh, ye powers on high!

				-

						A palace stored with treasures should be thine.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But if reluctant, who shall force thy stay?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Jove bids to set the stranger on his way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Till then, let slumber cross thy careful eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And seize the moment when the breezes rise:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Where thy soul rests, and labour is no more.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 17

						Far as Euboea though thy country lay,

				-
					-
						Our ships with ease transport thee in a day.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 19

					-
						Thither of old, earth’s giant son to view,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						On wings of wind with Rhadamanth they flew;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This land, from whence their morning course begun,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Saw them returning with the setting sun.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale,

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 24

					-
						Our youth how dexterous, and how fleet our sail,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 25
				-
					-
						When justly timed with equal sweep they row,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 26: Verse 26

						And ocean whitens in long tracks below.”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus he. No word the experienced man replies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But thus to heaven (and heavenward lifts his eyes):
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“O Jove! O father! what the king accords
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Do thou make perfect! sacred be his words!
					-

						Wide o’er the world Alcinous’ glory shine!

						Let fame be his, and ah! my country mine!”
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime Arete, for the hour of rest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ordains the fleecy couch, and covering vest;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the thick carpets spread with busy care.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With torches blazing in their hands they pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And finish’d all their queen’s command with haste:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then gave the signal to the willing guest:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He rose with pleasure, and retired to rest.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						There, soft extended, to the murmuring sound
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Within, released from cares, Alcinous lies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And fast beside were closed Arete’s eyes.

						Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And all the ruddy orient flames with day:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Alcinous, and the chief, with dawning light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rose instant from the slumbers of the night;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then to the council-seat they bend their way,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 6

						And fill the shining thrones along the bay.

						Meanwhile Minerva, in her guardian care,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In form, a herald of the king, she flies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From peer to peer, and thus incessant cries;
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Nobles and chiefs who rule Phæacia’s states,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The king in council your attendance waits;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A prince of grace divine your aid implores,

						O’er unknown seas arrived from unknown shores.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At once the seats they fill; and every eye
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Glazed, as before some brother of the sky.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-

						Pallas with grace divine his form improves,

					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						More high he treads, and more enlarged he moves:

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And gives a dignity of mien, to awe;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With strength, the future prize of fame to play,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And gather all the honours of the day.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose;

					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Attend (he cried) while we our will disclose.

				-
					-
						Your present aid this godlike stranger craves,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Toss’d by rude tempest through a war of waves;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Perhaps from realms that view the rising day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or nations subject to the western ray.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 7

					-
						(For here affliction never pleads in vain);

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Be chosen youth prepared, expert to try
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The vast profound and bid the vessel fly;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Launch the tall back, and order every oar;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then in our court indulge the genial hour.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Instant, you sailors to this task attend;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Swift to the palace, all ye peers ascend;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Let none to strangers honours due disclaim:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Be there Demodocus the bard of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Taught by the gods to please, when high he sings
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The vocal lay, responsive to the strings.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the prince; the attending peers obey;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In state they move; Alcinous heads the way
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift to Demodocus the herald flies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						At once the sailors to their charge arise;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then to the palace move: a gathering throng,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now all accesses to the dome are fill’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill’d;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Two beeves, twelve fatlings, from the flock they bring
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To crown the feast; so wills the bounteous king.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The herald now arrives, and guides along
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The sacred master of celestial song;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With mighty blessings, mix’d with mighty woe;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						With clouds of darkness quench’d his visual ray,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						High on a radiant throne sublime in state,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With silver shone the throne; his lyre, well strung
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To rapturous sounds, at hand Poutonous hung.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Before his seat a polish’d table shines,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And a full goblet foams with generous wines;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His food a herald bore; and now they fed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And now the rage of craving hunger fled.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The mighty deeds of demigods and kings;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From that fierce wrath the noble song arose,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						That made Ulysses and Achilles foes;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How o’er the feast they doom the fall of Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The stern debate Atrides hears with joy;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The marble threshold of the Delphic god,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Curious to learn the counsels of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Touch’d at the song, Ulysses straight resign’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To soft affliction all his manly mind.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Before his eyes the purple vest he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Industrious to conceal the falling dew;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But when the music paused, he ceased to shed
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He pour’d a pure libation to the ground.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Transported with the song, the listening train
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Again with loud applause demand the strain;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Again Ulysses veil’d his pensive head.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Again unmann’d, a shower of sorrows shed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Conceal’d he wept; the king observed alone
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then to the bard aloud—“O cease to sing,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of heavenly song has crown’d the genial hour!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Incessant in the games your strength display,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Contest, ye brave the honours of the day!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In distant regions the Phæacian fame:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Or swifter in the race devour the way;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						None in the leap spring with so strong a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In state they move, Alcinous lends the way;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High on a column in the palace hung;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And guided by a herald’s guardian cares,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now swarms the populace: a countless throng,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Youth and hoar age; and man drives man along.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The games begin; ambitious of the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And famed Amphialus, Polyneus’ heir;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Naubolides with grace unequall’d shone,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or equall’d by Laodamas alone.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With these came forth Ambasineus the strong:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Start from the goal, and vanish o’er the strand:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And drifts of rising dust involve the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before the rest, what space the hinds allow
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Clytonius sprung: he wing’d the rapid way,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bore the unrivall’d honours of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Amphialus sprung forward with a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Superior in the leap, a length of ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						From Elatreus’ strong arm the discus flies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And sings with unmatch’d force along the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 12: Verse 15

				-
					-
						By bribes seduced; and how the sun, whose eye
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Views the broad heavens, disclosed the lawless joy.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Stung to the soul, indignant through the skies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Arrived, his sinewy arms incessant place
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The eternal anvil on the massy base.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 25
				-
					-
						A wondrous net he labours, to betray
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The wanton lovers, as entwined they lay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Indissolubly strong; Then instant bears
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To his immortal dome the finish’d snares:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Above, below, around, with art dispread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The sure inclosure folds the genial bed:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Whose texture even the search of gods deceives,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Then, as withdrawing from the starry bowers,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 34
				-
					-
						He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 35
				-
					-
						His favourite isle: observant Mars descries
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His wish’d recess, and to the goddess flies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 37
				-
					-
						He glows, he burns, the fair-hair’d queen of love
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Descends, smooth gliding from the courts of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he press’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 28: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With eager joy, and with a sigh address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Come, my beloved! and taste the soft delights:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Come, to repose the genial bed invites:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy absent spouse, neglectful of thy charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Prefers his barbarous Sintians to thy arms!”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then, nothing loth, the enamour’d fair he led,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And sunk transported on the conscious bed.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Down rush’d the toils, inwrapping as they lay
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The careless lovers in their wanton play:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In vain they strive; the entangling snares deny
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						(Inextricably firm) the power to fly.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Warn’d by the god who sheds the golden day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Arrived, he sees, he grieves, with rage he burns:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Full horribly he roars, his voice all heaven returns.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O Jove (he cried) O all ye powers above,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						See the lewd dalliance of the queen of love!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Me, awkward me, she scorns; and yields her charms
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If I am lame, that stain my natal hour
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						By fate imposed; such me my parent bore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Why was I born? See how the wanton lies!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Oh sight tormenting to a husband’s eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But yet, I trust, this once e’en Mars would fly
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His fair-one’s arms—he thinks her, once, too nigh.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But there remain, ye guilty, in my power,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Till Jove refunds his shameless daughter’s dower.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Too dear I prized a fair enchanting face:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 31: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But modesty withheld the goddess train.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						All heaven beholds, imprison’d as they lie,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And unextinguish’d laughter shakes the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then mutual, thus they spoke: “Behold on wrong

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Swift vengeance waits; and art subdues the strong!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Must pay the penalty for lawless charms.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Wouldst thou enchain’d like Mars, O Hermes, lie
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin’d;)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Loud laugh the rest, e’en Neptune laughs aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Yet sues importunate to loose the god.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“And free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He suffers who gives surety for the unjust:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To liberty restored, perfidious fly:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?” He instant cries,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom appeased: “No more I urge delay;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						When Neptune sues, my part is to obey.”
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then to the snares his force the god applies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To visit Paphos and her blooming groves,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Where to the Power an hundred altars rise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And breathing odours scent the balmy skies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial showers,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Unguents that charm the gods! she last assumes
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Her wondrous robes; and full the goddess blooms.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus sung the bard: Ulysses hears with joy,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And loud applauses read the vaulted sky.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then to the sports his sons the king commands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each blooming youth before the monarch stands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In dance unmatch’d! A wondrous ball is brought
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(The work of Polypus, divinely wrought);
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This youth with strength enormous bids it fly,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And bending backward whirls it to the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His brother, springing with an active bound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 8
				-
					-
						At distance intercepts it from the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The assembly gazes with astonished eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 39: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And sends in shouts applauses to the skies.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 40
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus Ulysses: “Happy king, whose name
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In subjects happy with surprise I gaze;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 40: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 41
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Pleas’d with his people’s fame, the monarch hears,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thus benevolent accosts the peers:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Since wisdom’s sacred guidance he pursues,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Give to the stranger-guest a stranger’s dues:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Twelve princes in our realm dominion share,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 6
				-
					-
						O’er whom supreme, imperial power I bear;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A vest, a robe, and imitate your king.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Be swift to give: that he this night may share
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The social feast of joy, with joy sincere.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 41: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 42
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The assenting peers, obedient to the king,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then thus Euryalus: “O prince, whose sway
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Rules this bless’d realm, repentant I obey;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A ruddy gleam; whose hilt a silver blaze;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Whose ivory sheath, inwrought with curious pride,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Adds graceful terror to the wearer’s side.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and to his hand the sword consign’d:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“And if (he cried) my words affect thy mind,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds, bear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Crown, O ye heavens, with joy his peaceful hours,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 43: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And grant him to his spouse, and native shores.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 44
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 44: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“And blest be thou, my friend, (Ulysses cries,)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Crown him with every joy, ye favouring skies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 44: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To thy calm hours continued peace afford,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 44: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And never, never mayst thou want this sword,”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, and o’er his shoulder flung the blade.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Now o’er the earth ascends the evening shade:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And to the court the embodied peers repair.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before the queen Alcinous’ sons unfold
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The vests, the robes, and heaps of shining gold;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then to the radiant thrones they move in state:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 45: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Aloft, the king in pomp imperial sate.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thence to the queen: “O partner of our reign,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O sole beloved! command thy menial train
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A polish’d chest and stately robes to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And healing waters for the bath prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That, bathed, our guest may bid his sorrows cease,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Hear the sweet song, and taste the feast in peace.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A bowl that flames with gold, of wondrous frame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ourself we give, memorial of our name;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To raise in offerings to almighty Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 46: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And every god that treads the courts above.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Instant the queen, observant of the king,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Commands her train a spacious vase to bring,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The spacious vase with ample streams suffice,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Heap the high wood, and bid the flames arise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The fuming waters bubble o’er the blaze.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Herself the chest prepares; in order roll’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The robes, the vests are ranged, and heaps of gold
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And adding a rich dress inwrought with art,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A gift expressive of her bounteous heart.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thus spoke to Ithacus: “To guard with bands

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 47: Verse 12

						Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands;

						Then bending with full force around he roll’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 48: Verse 3

						Closed with Circaean art. A train attends

						Where, happy as the gods that range the sky,

						He feasted every sense with every joy.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 48: Verse 9

						He bathes; the damsels with officious toil,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 48: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shed sweets, shed unguents, in a shower of oil;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 48: Verse 11

						Then o’er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads,

						With wondering eyes the hero she survey’d,

						The bard a herald guides; the gazing throng

						Pay low obeisance as he moves along:

						When now the rage of hunger was allay’d,

						Thus to the lyrist wise Ulysses said:

						“O more than man! thy soul the muse inspires,

						Or taught the labours of the dreadful day:

					-
						The song recalls past horrors to my eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 10

						Once more harmonious strike the sounding string,

					-
						The Epaean fabric, framed by Pallas, sing:
					-

					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 13
				-
					-
						How stern Ulysses, furious to destroy,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With latent heroes sack’d imperial Troy.

					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 15

					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The god himself inspires thy breast with flame
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And mine shall be the task henceforth to raise

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 53: Verse 18

						In every land thy monument of praise.”
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Full of the god he raised his lofty strain:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						How the Greeks rush’d tumultuous to the main;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How blazing tents illumined half the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 4
				-
					-
						While from the shores the winged navy flies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						How e’en in Ilion’s walls, in deathful bands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Came the stern Greeks by Troy’s assisting hands:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All Troy up-heaved the steed; of differing mind,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Various the Trojans counsell’d: part consign’d
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The monster to the sword, part sentence gave
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The unwise award to lodge it in the towers,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 12
				-
					-
						An offering sacred to the immortal powers:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And by the gods’ decree proud Ilion falls:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Destruction enters in the treacherous wood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 54: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 2
				-
					-
						How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How to thy dome, Deiphobus! ascends
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Spartan king; how Ithacus attends
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(Horrid as Mars); and how with dire alarms
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 55: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He fights—subdues, for Pallas strings his arms
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 56
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while he sung, Ulysses’ griefs renew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As some fond matron views in mortal fight
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Her husband falling in his country’s right;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Frantic through clashing swords she runs, she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 6
				-
					-
						As ghastly pale he groans, and faints and dies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Close to his breast she grovels on the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 9
				-
					-
						She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Relentless mocks her violence of woe:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To chains condemn’d, as wildly she deplores;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 56: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A widow, and a slave on foreign shores.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 57
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So from the sluices of Ulysses’ eyes
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Conceal’d he grieved: the king observed alone
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then to the bard aloud: “O cease to sing,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To every note his tears responsive flow,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And o’er the banquet every heart be gay:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This social right demands: for him the sails,

				-

						Floating in air, invite the impelling gales:

					-
						His are the gifts of love: the wise and good
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 57: Verse 14

						Receive the stranger as a brother’s blood.

						Artful concealment ill becomes the brave:

						Say what thy birth, and what the name you bore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Imposed by parents in the natal hour?

						(For from the natal hour distinctive names,

						And what inhabitants those regions boast?

						So shalt thou instant reach the realm assign’d,

						No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;

						These ears have heard my royal sire disclose

					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A dreadful story, big with future woes;

					-
						How Neptune raged, and how, by his command,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A monument of wrath; how mound on mound

						Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground.

						Say why the fate of Troy awaked thy cares,

						Why heaved thy bosom, and why flowed thy tears?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Just are the ways of Heaven: from Heaven proceed

					-
						The woes of man; Heaven doom’d the Greeks to bleed,

						A theme of future song! Say, then, if slain
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Some dear-loved brother press’d the Phrygian plain?

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 58: Verse 41

						Or bled some friend, who bore a brother’s part,

						And claim’d by merit, not by blood, the heart?”

					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 17

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 11: Verse 19

					-
						If still to live, or desperate plunge to fate;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay,

						Our groan the rocks remurmur’d to the main.

						Our thirst and hunger hastily repress’d;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 12

					-
						But soon his sons their well-known guest descried,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And starting from their couches loudly cried:

					-
						‘Ulysses here! what demon could’st thou meet

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This does a tunic and white vest convey,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A various casket that, of rich inlay,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 8: Verse 7

						And bread and wine the third. The cheerful mates

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At once they bend, and strike their equal oars,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And leave the sinking hills and lessening shores.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While on the deck the chief in silence lies,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As fiery coursers in the rapid race
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Urged by fierce drivers through the dusty space,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Toss their high heads, and scour along the plain,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 9: Verse 10

						Back to the stern the parted billows flow,

					-
						Much danger, long and mighty toils he bore,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In storms by sea, and combats on the shore;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All which soft sleep now banish’d from his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Wrapp’d in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest.

						Flamed in the front of heaven, and promised day;

				-
					-
						Like distant clouds the mariner descries
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 4

						Fair Ithaca’s emerging hills arise.

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 5

					-
						Far from the town a spacious port appears,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sacred to Phorcys’ power, whose name it bears;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Two craggy rocks projecting to the main,

				-

					-
						Within the waves in softer murmurs glide,

				-

				-
					-
						And ships secure without their halsers ride.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						High at the head a branching olive grows,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 12

					-
						And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs.

						Beneath, a gloomy grotto’s cool recess

				-
					-
						Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Where bowls and urns were form’d of living stone,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And massy beams in native marble shone,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						On which the labours of the nymphs were roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Their webs divine of purple mix’d with gold.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Within the cave the clustering bees attend
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Their waxen works, or from the roof depend.
					-
				-

						Two marble doors unfold on either side;

					-
						Sacred the south, by which the gods descend;

						His treasures next, Alcinous’ gifts, they laid
					-
				-

				-
					-
						In the wild olive’s unfrequented shade,

				-

				-
					-
						Secure from theft; then launch’d the bark again,

						Resumed their oars, and measured back the main,

				-

					-
						Nor yet forgot old Ocean’s dread supreme,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 12: Verse 10

					-
						And menaced vengeance, ere he reach’d his shore;

						To reach his natal shore was thy decree;

				-
					-
						From all the eluded dangers of the deep;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 13: Verse 11

						Lo where he lies, amidst a shining store
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of brass, rich garments, and refulgent ore;

						But Pallas knew (thy friends and navy lost)
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Once more ’twas given thee to behold thy coast;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Yet how could I with adverse Fate engage,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And mighty Neptune’s unrelenting rage?
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Now lift thy longing eyes, while I restore
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The pleasing prospect of thy native shore.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Bebold the port of Phorcys! fenced around
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With rocky mountains, and with olives crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Behold the gloomy grot! whose cool recess
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Whose now-neglected altars in thy reign
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Blush’d with the blood of sheep and oxen slain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Behold! where Neritus the clouds divides,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 30: Verse 27

						And shakes the waving forests on his sides.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 1

					-
						So spake the goddess; and the prospect clear’d,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The mists dispersed, and all the coast appeared.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king with joy confess’d his place of birth,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And on his knees salutes his mother earth;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then, with his suppliant hands upheld in air,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus to the sea-green sisters sends his prayer;
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“All hail! ye virgin daughters of the main!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ye streams, beyond my hopes, beheld again!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To you once more your own Ulysses bows;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Attend his transports, and receive his vows!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						If Jove prolong my days, and Pallas crown
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The growing virtues of my youthful son,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To you shall rites divine be ever paid,

						And grateful offerings on your altars laid.”
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 1

					-
						Thus then Minerva: “From that anxious breast

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Dismiss those cares, and leave to heaven the rest.

						Our task be now thy treasured stores to save,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Deep in the close recesses of the cave;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then future means consult.” She spoke, and trod
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The shady grot, that brighten’d with the god.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The closest caverns of the grot she sought;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The gold, the brass, the robes, Ulysses brought;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						These in the secret gloom the chief disposed;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The entrance with a rock the goddess closed.
					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 34
			-

				-
					-
						Now, seated in the olive’s sacred shade,

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Confer the hero and the martial maid.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 3

						The goddess of the azure eyes began:

				-
					-
						“Son of Laertes! much-experienced man!
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The suitor-train thy earliest care demand,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of that luxurious race to rid the land;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Three years thy house their lawless rule has seen,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And proud addresses to the matchless queen.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But she thy absence mourns from day to day,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And inly bleeds, and silent wastes away;
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Elusive of the bridal hour, she gives
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-

					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To this Ulysses: “O celestial maid!

					-
						Praised be thy counsel, and thy timely aid;

				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Else had I seen my native walls in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Like great Atrides, just restored and slain.
					-
				-
					Book 13: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate,

						And plan with all thy arts the scene of fate.

				-
					-
						Then, then be present, and my soul inspire,

						As when we wrapp’d Troy’s heaven-built walls in fire.

					-
			-
				Book 13: Stanza 36
			-

						And secret walk unknown to mortal eyes.

						Estrange thee from thy own; thy son, thy wife;

				-
					-
						Ordain’d for lawless rioters to bleed!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Perhaps, supported at another’s board!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Far from his country roams my hapless lord;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or sigh’d in exile forth his latest breath,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 3: Verse 12

						Now cover’d with the eternal shade of death!

						Our woods not void of hospitality.

						He said, and, seconding the kind request,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With friendly step precedes his unknown guest.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 3

						A shaggy goat’s soft hide beneath him spread,

				-

				-
					-
						And with fresh rushes heap’d an ample bed;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Jove touch’d the hero’s tender soul, to find
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So just reception from a heart so kind:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And “Oh, ye gods! with all your blessings grace
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 5: Verse 8

						(He thus broke forth) this friend of human race!”
					-

						The swain replied: “It never was our guise

				-
					-
						To slight the poor, or aught humane despise:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 3

						For Jove unfolds our hospitable door,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 4

						’Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor,

					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Little, alas! is all the good I can
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 6

						A man oppress’d, dependent, yet a man:

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Accept such treatment as a swain affords,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Slave to the insolence of youthful lords!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Far hence is by unequal gods removed
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						That man of bounties, loving and beloved!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To whom whate’er his slave enjoys is owed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And more, had Fate allow’d, had been bestow’d:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But Fate condemn’d him to a foreign shore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Much have I sorrow’d, but my Master more.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now cold he lies, to death’s embrace resign’d:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon’s name,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 6: Verse 18

					-
						He trod so fatally the paths of fame.”
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 7
			-

						His vest succinct then girding round his waist,

					-
						Forth rush’d the swain with hospitable haste.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of two, his cutlass launch’d the spouting blood;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						These quarter’d, singed, and fix’d on forks of wood,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And smoking, back the tasteful viands drew.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Broachers and all then an the board display’d
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The ready meal, before Ulysses laid
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With flour imbrown’d; next mingled wine yet new,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And luscious as the bees’ nectareous dew:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then sate, companion of the friendly feast,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With open look; and thus bespoke his guest:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						“Take with free welcome what our hands prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Such food as falls to simple servants’ share;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The best our lords consume; those thoughtless peers,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Rich without bounty, guilty without fears;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And honour justice and the righteous breast.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Pirates and conquerors of harden’d mind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						To whom offending men are made a prey
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						When Jove in vengeance gives a land away;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						E’en these, when of their ill-got spoils possess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Some voice of God close whispering from within,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						‘Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.’
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						That tells, the great Ulysses is no more.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Constant as Jove the night and day bestows,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 35

					-
						None match’d this hero’s wealth, of all who reign

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						O’er the fair islands of the neighbouring main.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The wide-extended continents obey:

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						First, on the main land, of Ulysses’ breed
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on ocean’s margin feed;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear’d;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						As many lodgments for the tusky herd;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Two foreign keepers guard: and here are seen
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						To native pastors is their charge assign’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 46

					-
						And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;

					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						All to the suitors’ wasteful board preferr’d.”
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Thus he, benevolent: his unknown guest
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						With hunger keen devours the savoury feast;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Eumaeus pours on high the purple tide;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The king with smiling looks his joy express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 7: Verse 55

						And thus the kind inviting host address’d:

						“Say now, what man is he, the man deplored,

					-
						So rich, so potent, whom you style your lord?

					-
						Late with such affluence and possessions bless’d,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And now in honour’s glorious bed at rest.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whoever was the warrior, he must be
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To fame no stranger, nor perhaps to me:

					Book 14: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Who (so the gods and so the Fates ordain’d)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 8: Verse 8

						(Replied Eumaeus) to the wandering tribe.

				-
					-
						For needy strangers still to flattery fly,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And want too oft betrays the tongue to lie.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-

						Each vagrant traveller, that touches here,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 6

					-
						Deludes with fallacies the royal ear,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To dear remembrance makes his image rise,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Such thou mayst be. But he whose name you crave
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Moulders in earth, or welters on the wave,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or food for fish or dogs his relics lie,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or torn by birds are scatter’d through the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So perish’d he: and left (for ever lost)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Much woe to all, but sure to me the most.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 15

						So mild a master never shall I find;

						Less dear the parents whom I left behind,

				-
					-
						Less soft my mother, less my father kind.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 18

						Not with such transport would my eyes run o’er,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Again to hail them in their native shore,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						As loved Ulysses once more to embrace,

						Restored and breathing in his natal place.

						E’en in his absence I pronounce with fear:

					-
						In my respect, he bears a prince’s part;

						“On dark reserve what better can prevail,

				-
					-
						Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale,

						Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place

						Confer, and wines and cates the table grace;

						But most, the kind inviter’s cheerful face?

						Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown’d,

						But such was Heaven’s high will! Know then, I came
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Castor Hylacides (that name he bore),
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Beloved and honour’d in his native shore;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 14

					-
						Bless’d in his riches, in his children more.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						I shared his kindness with his lawful race:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But when that fate, which all must undergo,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						From earth removed him to the shades below,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 19

					-
						The large domain his greedy sons divide,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 20

					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 21

					-
						Little, alas! was left my wretched share,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Except a house, a covert from the air:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						But what by niggard fortune was denied,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A willing widow’s copious wealth supplied.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 25

						My valour was my plea, a gallant mind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 26

						That, true to honour, never lagg’d behind

						Now wasting years my former strength confound,

					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 32

						Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And the fair ranks of battle to deform;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 35
				-

						And tempt the secret ambush of the night.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 40

						But works of peace my soul disdain’d to bear,

						The rural labour, or domestic care.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 42

						To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And send swift arrows from the bounding string,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 44

						Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind;

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Those gods, who turn (to various ends design’d)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The various thoughts and talents of mankind.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 47

					-
						Before the Grecians touch’d the Trojan plain,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Nine times commander or by land or main,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 49
				-
					-
						In foreign fields I spread my glory far,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 52
				-
					-
						To Crete return’d, an honourable name.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 53
				-
					-
						But when great Jove that direful war decreed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Our states myself and Idomen employ
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 56
				-
					-
						To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Nine years we warr’d; the tenth saw Ilion fall;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Homeward we sail’d, but heaven dispersed us all.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 59
				-
					-
						One only month my wife enjoy’d my stay;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 60
				-
					-
						So will’d the god who gives and takes away.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Nine ships I mann’d, equipp’d with ready stores,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Intent to voyage to the Ægyptian shores;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 63
				-
					-
						In feast and sacrifice my chosen train
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Six days consum’d; the seventh we plough’d the main.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Crete’s ample fields diminish to our eye;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Safe through the level seas we sweep our way;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The steersman governs, and the ships obey.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 69
				-
					-
						The fifth fair morn we stem the Ægyptian tide,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And tilting o’er the bay the vessels ride:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 71
				-
					-
						To anchor there my fellows I command,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And spies commission to explore the land.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 73
				-
					-
						But, sway’d by lust of gain, and headlong will,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The spreading clamour to their city flies,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Jove thunder’d on their side. Our guilty head
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 80
				-
					-
						We turn’d to flight; the gathering vengeance spread
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 81
				-
					-
						On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 82
				-
					-
						I then explored my thought, what course to prove
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 83
				-
					-
						(And sure the thought was dictated by Jove):
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Oh, had he left me to that happier doom,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And saved a life of miseries to come!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And low on earth my shield and javelin cast,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 88
				-
					-
						I meet the monarch with a suppliant’s face,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 90
				-
					-
						He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 91
				-
					-
						My state he pitied, and my tears he dried,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Restrain’d the rage the vengeful foe express’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And turn’d the deadly weapons from my breast.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Pious! to guard the hospitable rite,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 14: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And fearing Jove, whom mercy’s works delight.
					-
			-
				Book 14: Stanza 15

				-
					-
						“In Ægypt thus with peace and plenty bless’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						I lived (and happy still have lived) a guest.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On seven bright years successive blessings wait;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The next changed all the colour of my fate.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A false Phoenician, of insiduous mind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Versed in vile arts, and foe to humankind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With semblance fair invites me to his home;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						I seized the proffer (ever fond to roam):
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Domestic in his faithless roof I stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Till the swift sun his annual circle made.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To Libya then he mediates the way;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With guileful art a stranger to betray,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And sell to bondage in a foreign land:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Much doubting, yet compell’d I quit the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And far from ken of any other coast,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 19
				-
					-
						When all was wild expanse of sea and air,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then doom’d high Jove due vengeance to prepare.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 21
				-
					-
						He hung a night of horrors o’er their head
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(The shaded ocean blacken’d as it spread):
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						He launch’d the fiery bolt: from pole to pole
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Broad burst the lightnings, deep the thunders roll;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In giddy rounds the whirling ship is toss’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 27
				-
					-
						As from a hanging rock’s tremendous height,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The sable crows with intercepted flight
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Drop endlong; scarr’d, and black with sulphurous hue,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 30
				-
					-
						So from the deck are hurl’d the ghastly crew.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Such end the wicked found! but Jove’s intent
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Was yet to save the oppress’d and innocent.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Placed on the mast (the last resource of life)
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 34
				-
					-
						With winds and waves I held unequal strife:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 35
				-
					-
						For nine long days the billows tilting o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia’s shore.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The monarch’s son a shipwreck’d wretch relieved,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The sire with hospitable rites received,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And in his palace like a brother placed,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 41
				-
					-
						While here I sojourn’d, oft I heard the fame
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 42
				-
					-
						How late Ulysses to the country came.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 43
				-
					-
						How loved, how honour’d in this court he stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And here his whole collected treasure laid;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 45
				-
					-
						I saw myself the vast unnumber’d store
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And brass high heap’d amidst the regal dome;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Immense supplies for ages yet to come!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Meantime he voyaged to explore the will
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Of Jove, on high Dodona’s holy hill,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 51
				-
					-
						What means might best his safe return avail,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 52
				-
					-
						To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail?
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour’d the wine,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Attesting solemn all the powers divine,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 55
				-
					-
						That soon Ulysses would return, declared
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But first the king dismiss’d me from his shores,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 58
				-
					-
						For fair Dulichium crown’d with fruitful stores;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 59
				-
					-
						To good Acastus’ friendly care consign’d:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 60
				-
					-
						But other counsels pleased the sailors’ mind:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 61
				-
					-
						New frauds were plotted by the faithless train,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And misery demands me once again.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 64
				-
					-
						With ready hands they rush to seize their slave;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Then with these tatter’d rags they wrapp’d me round
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 66
				-
					-
						(Stripp’d of my own), and to the vessel bound.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 67
				-
					-
						At eve, at Ithaca’s delightful land
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The ship arriv’d: forth issuing on the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 69
				-
					-
						They sought repast; while to the unhappy kind,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 70
				-
					-
						The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Soft I descended, to the sea applied
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 72
				-
					-
						My naked breast, and shot along the tide.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Soon pass’d beyond their sight, I left the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And took the spreading shelter of the wood.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn’d;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 15: Verse 76
				-
					-
						But deem’d inquiry vain, and to their ships return’d.

						This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave;

				-
					-
						Then pour’d of offer’d wine the sable wave:

					-
						In great Ulysses’ hand he placed the bowl,

				-
					-
						The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 21: Verse 12
				-
					-
						(Eumaeus’ proper treasure bought this slave,

						And led from Taphos, to attend his board,

				-
					-
						In mere necessity of coat and cloak,

					-
						“Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace;

						And join’d me with them (’twas their own command);

					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A deathful ambush for the foe to lay,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 22

					-
						Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way:

				-
					-
						There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 24

						We made the osier-fringed bank our bed.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel.

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 29

						There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest,

						And the stars faded at approaching light,

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 36

					-
						Sudden I jogg’d Ulysses, who was laid
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 22: Verse 37
				-

						Fast by my side, and shivering thus I said:

						Let from among us some swift courier rise,

						Haste to the general, and demand supplies.’

						“Up started Thoas straight, Andraemon’s son,

						Nimbly he rose, and cast his garment down!
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Instant, the racer vanish’d off the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 25: Verse 4

						That instant in his cloak I wrapp’d me round:

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone
					-

						Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain!
					-

						The honest herdsman rose, as this he said,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And drew before the hearth the stranger’s bed;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The fleecy spoils of sheep, a goat’s rough hide
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 4

						He spreads; and adds a mantle thick and wide;

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 6

				-
					-
						All, but the careful master of the swine:

				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care;
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Well arm’d, and fenced against nocturnal air:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His weighty falchion o’er his shoulder tied:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied:
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There to the tusky herd he bends his way,
					-
				-
					Book 14: Stanza 28: Verse 16

						Where, screen’d from Boreas, high o’erarch’d they lay.

						Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns:

						Anxious she flies to great Ulysses’ heir,

						His instant voyage challenged all her care.

						Beneath the royal portico display’d,

						With Nestor’s son Telemachus was laid:

						In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies;

						Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal’d his eyes:

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress’d,
					-
				-

						And all thy fortunes roll’d within his breast.

						When, “O Telemachus! (the goddess said)
					-

						Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray’d,

						Thus leaving careless thy paternal right

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 14

						The robbers’ prize, the prey to lawless might.

						Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Fly, whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 20

						Hence, therefore, while thy stores thy own remain;

						Thou know’st the practice of the female train,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Lost in the children of the present spouse,

				-
					-
						They slight the pledges of their former vows;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Their love is always with the lover past;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Still the succeeding flame expels the last.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 29

						Let o’er thy house some chosen maid preside,

						Till Heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride.

						For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-

						In Samos’ sands, or straits of Ithaca;

						To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band,

						Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						No!—sooner far their riot and their lust

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						All-covering earth shall bury deep in dust!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-

						Then distant from the scatter’d islands steer,

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Nor let the night retard thy full career;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-

						Thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 51

						Thus spoke the goddess, and resumed her flight

					Book 15: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						To the pure regions of eternal light,

						Meanwhile Pisistratus he gently shakes,

						“Rise, son of Nestor; for the road prepare,

						“What cause (he cried) can justify our flight
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To tempt the dangers of forbidding night?
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 3: Verse 3

						Here wait we rather, till approaching day

					-
						Nor think of flight before the Spartan king
					-
				-

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Gifts, which to distant ages safely stored,

						The king from Helen rose, and sought his guest.

				-
					-
						As soon as his approach the hero knew,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The splendid mantle round him first he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then o’er his ample shoulders whirl’d the cloak,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Respectful met the monarch, and bespoke:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hail, great Atrides, favour’d of high Jove!

					Book 15: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Let not thy friends in vain for licence move.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift let us measure back the watery way,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 5: Verse 4

					-
						Nor check our speed, impatient of delay.”

				Book 15: Stanza 6

				-
					-
						“If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,

				-
					-
						Ill (said the king) should I thy wish oppose;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For oft in others freely I reprove
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The ill-timed efforts of officious love;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who love too much, hate in the like extreme,

						And both the golden mean alike condemn.

					-
						True friendship’s laws are by this rule express’d,

						Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.

					-
						Yet, stay, my friends, and in your chariot take
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The noblest presents that our love can make;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Meantime commit we to our women’s care

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 14

						Eludes the labours of the tedious way,

					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 17

						Then if a wider course shall rather please,

				-
					-
						Through spacious Argos and the realms of Greece,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 19

				-
					-
						Himself thy convoy to each royal friend.

						No prince will let Ulysses’ heir remove
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Without some pledge, some monument of love:

					-
						These will the caldron, these the tripod give;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						From those the well-pair’d mules we shall receive,

				Book 15: Stanza 7

						To whom the youth, for prudence famed, replied:

				-
					-
						“O monarch, care of heaven! thy people’s pride!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						No friend in Ithaca my place supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						No powerful hands are there, no watchful eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						My stores exposed and fenceless house demand
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The speediest succour from my guardian hand;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Lest, in a search too anxious and too vain,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His purpose when the generous warrior heard,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He charged the household cates to be prepared.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Was Boethoedes Eteoneus come;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And o’er the coals the smoking fragments lays.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Meantime the king, his son, and Helen went
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The king selected from the glittering rows
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A bowl; the prince a silver beaker chose.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The beauteous queen revolved with careful eyes
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Her various textures of unnumber’d dyes,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And chose the largest; with no vulgar art
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Her own fair hands embroider’d every part;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Like radiant Hesper o’er the gems of night,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then with each gift they hasten’d to their guest,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And thus the king Ulysses’ heir address’d:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						“Since fix’d are thy resolves, may thundering Jove
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With happiest omens thy desires approve!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Enchased with gold, this valued gift be thine;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						To me this present, of Vulcanian frame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						From Sidon’s hospitable monarch came;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To thee we now consign the precious load,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The pride of kings, and labour of a god.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then gave the cup, while Megapenthe brought
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The silver vase with living sculpture wrought.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The beauteous queen, advancing next, display’d
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The shining veil, and thus endearing said:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Accept, dear youth, this monument of love,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Long since, in better days, by Helen wove:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Safe in thy mother’s care the vesture lay,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meantime may’st thou with happiest speed regain
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The prince the variegated present took.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And now, when through the royal dome they pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High on a throne the king each stranger placed.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A golden ewer the attendant damsel brings,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Replete with water from the crystal springs;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With copious streams the shining vase supplies
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A silver layer of capacious size.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						They wash. The tables in fair order spread,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The glittering canisters are crown’d with bread;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Viands of various kinds allure the taste,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Atrides’ son the purple draught prepares,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And now (each sated with the genial feast,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceased)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Ulysses’ son, with his illustrious friend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The horses join, the polish’d car ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Along the court the fiery steeds rebound,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And the wide portal echoes to the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						(Libation destined to the powers divine)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						His right hand held: before the steed he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Then, mix’d with prayers, he utters these commands:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Farewell, and prosper, youths! let Nestor know
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For all the proofs of his paternal care,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Through the long dangers of the ten years’ war.”
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Ah! doubt not our report (the prince rejoin’d)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of all the virtues of thy generous mind.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And oh! return’d might we Ulysses meet!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To him thy presents show, thy words repeat:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						How will each speech his grateful wonder raise!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Scarce ended thus the prince, when on the right
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Advanced the bird of Jove: auspicious sight!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A milk-white fowl his clinching talons bore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With care domestic pampered at the floor.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In solemn speed the bird majestic flew
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full dexter to the car; the prosperous sight
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Fill’d every breast with wonder and delight.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But Nestor’s son the cheerful silence broke,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Say if to us the gods these omens send,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or fates peculiar to thyself portend?”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Whilst yet the monarch paused, with doubts oppress’d
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The beauteous queen relieved his labouring breast:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Hear me (she cried), to whom the gods have given
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To read this sign, and mystic sense of heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						As thus the plumy sovereign of the air
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Left on the mountain’s brow his callow care,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And wander’d through the wide ethereal way
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So shall thy godlike father, toss’d in vain
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Through all the dangers of the boundless main,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Arrive (or if perchance already come)
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						From slaughter’d gluttons to release the dome.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Oh! if this promised bliss by thundering Jove
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(The prince replied) stand fix’d in fate above;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To thee, as to some god, I’ll temples raise.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And crown thy altars with the costly blaze.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said; and bending o’er his chariot, flung
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The bounding shafts upon the harness play,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till night descending intercepts the way.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To Diocles at Pherae they repair,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whose boasted sire was sacred Alpheus’ heir;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With him all night the youthful stranger stay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor found the hospitable rites unpaid,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But soon as morning from her orient bed
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Had tinged the mountains with her earliest red,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						They join’d the steeds, and on the chariot sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The brazen portals in their passage rung.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To Pylos soon they came; when thus begun
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To Nestor’s heir Ulysses’ godlike son:
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Let not Pisistratus in vain be press’d,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor unconsenting hear his friend’s request;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His friend by long hereditary claim,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In toils his equal, and in years the same.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						No farther from our vessel, I implore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The coursers drive; but lash them to the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Too long thy father would his friend detain;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						I dread his proffer’d kindness urged in vain.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The hero paused, and ponder’d this request,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						While love and duty warr’d within his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At length resolved, he turn’d his ready hand,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And lash’d his panting coursers to the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There, while within the poop with care he stored
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The regal presents of the Spartan lord,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						“With speed begone (said he); call every mate,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ere yet to Nestor I the tale relate:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						’Tis true, the fervour of his generous heart
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Brooks no repulse, nor couldst thou soon depart:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Himself will seek thee here, nor wilt thou find,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In words alone, the Pylian monarch kind.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But when, arrived, he thy return shall know
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						How will his breast with honest fury glow!”
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						This said, the sounding strokes his horses fire,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And soon he reached the palace of his sire.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Now (cried Telemachus) with speedy care
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Hoist every sail, and every oar prepare.”
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Swift as the word his willing mates obey,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And seize their seats, impatient for the sea.
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime the prince with sacrifice adores
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Minerva, and her guardian aid implores;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When lo! a wretch ran breathless to the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						New from his crime; and reeking yet with gore.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A seer he was, from great Melampus sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Melampus, who in Pylos flourish’d long,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till, urged by wrongs, a foreign realm he chose,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Far from the hateful cause of all his woes.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Neleus his treasures one long year detains,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						As long he groan’d in Philacus’s chains:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Meantime, what anguish and what rage combined
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For lovely Pero rack’d his labouring mind!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Yet ’scaped he death; and vengeful of his wrong
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To Pylos drove the lowing herds along:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then (Neleus vanquish’d, and consign’d the fair
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To Bias’ arms) he so sought a foreign air;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Argos the rich for his retreat he chose,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						There form’d his empire; there his palace rose.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						From him Antiphates and Mantius came:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The first begot Oicleus great in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And he Amphiaraus, immortal name!
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The people’s saviour, and divinely wise,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Beloved by Jove, and him who gilds the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Yet short his date of life! by female pride he dies.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 25
				-
					-
						From Mantius Clitus, whom Aurora’s love
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Snatch’d for his beauty to the thrones above;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And Polyphides, on whom Phœbus shone
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 28
				-
					-
						With fullest rays, Amphiaraus now gone;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 29
				-
					-
						In Hyperesia’s groves he made abode,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And taught mankind the counsels of the god.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 31

						From him sprung Theoclymenus, who found

					-
						(The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground)
					-
				-

						Telemachus: whom, as to Heaven he press’d
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 22: Verse 34
				-
					-
						His ardent vows, the stranger thus address’d:

			-

					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O thou! that dost thy happy course prepare

				-
					-
						With pure libations and with solemn prayer:
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By that dread power to whom thy vows are paid;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By all the lives of these; thy own dear head,
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Declare sincerely to no foe’s demand
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 24
			-

					Book 15: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Prepare, then (said Telemachus), to know

						And great Ulysses (ever honour’d name!)

						Once was my sire, though now, for ever lost,

					-
						Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove;

				-
					-
						While in the port of Ithaca, the band

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of young Telemachus approach’d the land;

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their sails they loosed, they lash’d the mast aside,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And cast their anchors, and the cables tied:

				-

				-
					-
						Then on the breezy shore, descending, join

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 39: Verse 9

						No—let Eurymachus receive my guest,

				-
					-
						Of nature courteous, and by far the best;

				-
					-
						And emulates her former husband’s fame,

				-

				-
					-
						With what success, ’tis Jove’s alone to know,
					-

						The observing augur took the prince aside,

				-
					-
						Seized by the hand, and thus prophetic cried:

					-
						“Yon bird, that dexter cuts the aërial road,

					-
						“Succeed the omens, gods! (the youth rejoin’d:)

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind,

						The man who calls Telemachus his friend.”
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 44: Verse 5

					-
						Then to Peiraeus: “Thou whom time has proved

					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 45

						To this Peiraeus: “Joyful I obey,

				-
					-
						Well pleased the hospitable rites to pay.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 3

					-
						The presence of thy guest shall best reward

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 45: Verse 4
				-

						(If long thy stay) the absence of my lord.”
					-
			-
				Book 15: Stanza 46
			-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With that, their anchors he commands to weigh,

				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Mount the tall bark, and launch into the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 3
				-
					-
						All with obedient haste forsake the shores,

				-
					-
						And, placed in order, spread their equal oars.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then from the deck the prince his sandals takes;
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Poised in his hand the pointed javelin shakes.
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 7
				-
					-
						They part; while, lessening from the hero’s view
					-
				-
					Book 15: Stanza 46: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Swift to the town the well-row’d galley flew:

				-

					-
						The hero trod the margin of the main,

						Their gentle blandishment the king survey’d,

					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 3
			-

					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While yet he spoke, the prince advancing drew
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nigh to the lodge, and now appear’d in view.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Transported from his seat Eumaeus sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Dropp’d the full bowl, and round his bosom hung;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The tears rain’d copious in a shower of joy,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 8

						From foreign climes an only son receives

						(Child of his age), with strong paternal joy,

						Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy:

				-
					-
						So round the youth his arms Eumaeus spread,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 3: Verse 12

						As if the grave had given him from the dead.

				Book 16: Stanza 5

						They reach’d the dome; the dome with marble shined.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His seat Ulysses to the prince resign’d.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Not so (exclaims the prince with decent grace)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For me, this house shall find an humbler place:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To usurp the honours due to silver hairs
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And reverend strangers modest youth forbears.”
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And bids the rural throne with osiers rise.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						There sate the prince: the feast Eumaeus spread,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And heap’d the shining canisters with bread.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thick o’er the board the plenteous viands lay,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The frugal remnants of the former day.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said:
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whence, father, from what shore this stranger, say?
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What vessel bore him o’er the watery way?
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To human step our land impervious lies,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise.”
					-
			-
				Book 16: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The swain returns: “A tale of sorrows hear:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In spacious Crete he drew his natal air;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Long doom’d to wander o’er the land and main,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Half breathless ’scaping to the land he flew
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 8: Verse 6

						From Thesprot mariners, a murderous crew.
					-
				-

						To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign;

						’Midst the swell’d insolence of lust and pride?

				-
					-
						Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 7

						Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						However, stranger! from our grace receive
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Such honours as befit a prince to give;
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And safe to sail with ornaments of love.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-

						Till then, thy guest amid the rural train,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Far from the court, from danger far, detain.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 15

						’Tis mine with food the hungry to supply,

					-
						And clothe the naked from the inclement sky.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Here dwell in safety from the suitors’ wrongs,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And the rude insults of ungovern’d tongues.
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						For should’st thou suffer, powerless to relieve,
					-
				-

						I must behold it, and can only grieve.

						The brave, encompass’d by an hostile train,

				Book 16: Stanza 10

						To whom, while anger in his bosom glows,

					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Since audience mild is deign’d, permit my tongue

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 4

					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 5

						My heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave

						Live to base insolence or power a slave,

					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And hear their midnight revels uncontroll’d?
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Or that these wither’d nerves like thine were strung,

				-

				-
					-
						Or, heavens! might he return! (and soon appear

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He shall, I trust; a hero scorns despair:)
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-

						Might he return, I yield my life a prey
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Oppress’d by numbers in the glorious strife,

						I chose the nobler part, and yield my breath,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Rather than bear dishonor, worse than death;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 23

						The reverend stranger and the spotless maid;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 10: Verse 25

						Thus he, with anger flashing from his eye;

				-
					-
						Sincere the youthful hero made reply:

				-
					-
						Gives from our stock an only branch to spring:

					-
						Alone Laertes reign’d Arcesius’ heir,
					-
				-

						And I alone the bed connubial graced,

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						An unbless’d offspring of a sire unbless’d!
					-

				-
					-
						Each neighbouring realm, conducive to our woe,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 11: Verse 14

					-
						Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe:
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills,
					-
				-
					Book 16: Stanza 11: Verse 16

						And lofty Zacinth crown’d with shady hills.

						The imperial sceptre, and the regal bed:

						The queen, averse to love, yet awed by power,

						Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour:

				-
					-
						Meantime their licence uncontroll’d I bear;

				-
					Book 16: Stanza 11: Verse 22

					-
						E’en now they envy me the vital air:

						At once his vestures change; at once she sheds

						Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly,

				-
					-
						(Scene of their insolence) the lords resort:

				-

					-
						Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive,

					-
						Medon the herald (one who pleased them best,

						And honour’d with a portion of their feast),

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 29
				-
					-
						To bid the banquet, interrupts their play:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Their garments, and succinct the victims slay.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And the proud steer was o’er the marble spread.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 34

						While thus the copious banquet they provide,

						My feeble step, since rugged is the way.”

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Wide-patch’d, and fasten’d by a twisted thong.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 53
				-
					-
						A staff Eumaeus gave. Along the way
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Cheerly they fare: behind, the keepers stay:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 55
				-
					-
						These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 56

						Supply his absence, and attend the herd.

						And now his city strikes the monarch’s eyes,

					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Alas! how changed! a man of miseries;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Propp’d on a staff, a beggar old and bare
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 60
				-
					-
						In rags dishonest fluttering with the air!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Now pass’d the rugged road, they journey down
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 62
				-
					-
						The cavern’d way descending to the town,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Where, from the rock, with liquid drops distils
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 64
				-
					-
						A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Its current thence to serve the city brings;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 66
				-
					-
						An useful work, adorn’d by ancient kings.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there,

				-
					-
						In sculptured stone immortalized their care,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 69
				-
					-
						In marble urns received it from above,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And shaded with a green surrounding grove;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Where silver alders, in high arches twined,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Beneath, sequester’d to the nymphs, is seen
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 74
				-
					-
						A mossy altar, deep embower’d in green;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Where constant vows by travellers are paid,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 11: Verse 76

						And holy horrors solemnize the shade.

						Here with his goats (not vow’d to sacred fame,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But pamper’d luxury) Melanthius came:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Two grooms attend him. With an envious look
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:

				-
					-
						“The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!

						Heaven with a secret principle endued

						Mankind, to seek their own similitude.

						Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look’d guest?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From every great man’s gate repulsed with scorn:

					-
						To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						’Twas but for scraps he ask’d, and ask’d in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To beg, than work, he better understands,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For any office could the slave be good,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						If any labour those big joints could learn,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 13: Verse 19

						Dearly, full dearly, shalt thou buy thy bread

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He thus: nor insolent of word alone,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Spurn’d with his rustic heel his king unknown;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Spurn’d, but not moved: he like a pillar stood,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor stirr’d an inch, contemptuous, from the road:

				-

				-
					-
						Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-

						Or greet the pavement with his worthless head.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 7

						Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured,

				-
					-
						The hero stood self-conquer’d, and endured.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						But hateful of the wretch, Eumaeus heaved
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His hands obtesting, and this prayer conceived:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						“Daughters of Jove! who from the ethereal bowers
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 14: Verse 12

						Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names

					-
						To whom Ulysses’ piety preferr’d

				-
					-
						The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd;

						Succeed my wish, your votary restore:

					-
						Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large,

						Commences courtier, and neglects his charge.”

					Book 17: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;)

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 16

						So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Turn’d his proud step, and left them on their way.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Straight to the feastful palace he repair’d,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Familiar enter’d, and the banquet shared;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-

						He took his place, and plenty heap’d the board.

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky

					Book 17: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain):

						“Well may this palace admiration claim,

				-
					-
						Great and respondent to the master’s fame!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Stage above stage the imperial structure stands,

					-
						High walls and battlements the courts inclose,

					-
						And the strong gates defy a host of foes.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Far other cares its dwellers now employ;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The throng’d assembly and the feast of joy:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 18: Verse 9

					-
						I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire,

						Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest

				-
					-
						Wait for a space without, but wait not long;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 19: Verse 6

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-

					-
						And I am learn’d in all her train of woes;

					-
						He not unconscious of the voice and tread,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head;

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Bred by Ulysses, nourish’d at his board,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But, ah! not fated long to please his lord;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 8

					-
						The voice of glory call’d him o’er the main.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 9

					-
						Till then in every sylvan chase renown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 10

					-
						With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 12

					-
						Or traced the mazy leveret o’er the lawn.
					-
				-

					-
						And where on heaps the rich manure was spread,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 21: Verse 16

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 22

						He knew his lord; he knew, and strove to meet;

				-
					-
						Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 22: Verse 7

					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now years unnerve him, and his lord is lost!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The women keep the generous creature bare,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A sleek and idle race is all their care:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The master gone, the servants what restrains?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Or dwells humanity where riot reigns?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Jove fix’d it certain, that whatever day
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 24: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, the honest herdsman strode before;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The musing monarch pauses at the door:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						So closed for ever faithful Argus’ eyes!
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now Telemachus, the first of all,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Distant he saw, across the shady dome;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then gave a sign, and beckon’d him to come:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						There stood an empty seat, where late was placed,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In order due, the steward of the feast,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						(Who now was busied carving round the board,)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Eumaeus took, and placed it near his lord.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Before him instant was the banquet spread,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Next came Ulysses lowly at the door,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A figure despicable, old, and poor.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Propp’d on a staff, and trembling as he went.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then, resting on the threshold of the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Against a cypress pillar lean’d his weight
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Smooth’d by the workman to a polish’d plane);
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The thoughtful son beheld, and call’d his swain
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“These viands, and this bread, Eumaeus! bear,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And let yon mendicant our plenty share:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And let him circle round the suitors’ board,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And try the bounty of each gracious lord.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						His lord’s command the faithful servant bears:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The seeming beggar answers with his prayers:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Bless’d be Telemachus! in every deed
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Inspire him. Jove! in every wish succeed!”
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This said, the portion from his son convey’d
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With smiles receiving on his scrip he laid.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He fed, and ceased when silence held the lyre.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To tempt their bounties with a suppliant’s art,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And learn the generous from the ignoble heart
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(Not but his soul, resentful as humane,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train);
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Humble he moves, imploring all around.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The proud feel pity, and relief bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With such an image touch’d of human woe;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Inquiring all, their wonder they confess,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 29: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And eye the man, majestic in distress.
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						While thus they gaze and question with their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bold Melanthius to their thought replies:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“My lords! this stranger of gigantic port
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The good Eumaeus usher’d to your court.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full well I mark’d the features of his face,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Though all unknown his clime, or noble race.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“And is this present, swineherd! of thy band?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Bring’st thou these vagrants to infest the land?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Returns Antinous with retorted eye)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Objects uncouth, to check the genial joy.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Enough of these our court already grace;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of giant stomach, and of famish’d face.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 31: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To share our feast, and lead the life of kings.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom the hospitable swain rejoins:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Who calls, from distant nations to his own,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The poor, distinguish’d by their wants alone?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Round the wide world are sought those men divine
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Who public structures raise, or who design;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or bless with salutary arts to heal;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But chief to poets such respect belongs,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By rival nations courted for their songs;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						These states invite, and mighty kings admire,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Wide as the sun displays his vital fire.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						It is not so with want! how few that feed
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A wretch unhappy, merely for his need!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Unjust to me, and all that serve the state,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 17
				-
					-
						For me, suffice the approbation won
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 32: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of my great mistress, and her godlike son.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him Telemachus: “No more incense
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The man by nature prone to insolence:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Injurious minds just answers but provoke”—
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Thanks to thy care! whose absolute command
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus drives the stranger from our court and land.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Heaven bless its owner with a better mind!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From envy free, to charity inclined.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						This both Penelope and I afford:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses’ board.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To give another’s is thy hand so slow?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(Antinous cries with insolent disdain):
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Portions like mine if every suitor gave,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke, and lifting high above the board
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The rest with equal hand conferr’d the bread:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He fill’d his scrip, and to the threshold sped;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But first before Antinous stopp’d, and said:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“Bestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then, as in dignity, be first in worth,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Once I enjoy’d in luxury of state
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whate’er gives man the envied name of great;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And hospitality was then my praise;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In every sorrowing soul I pour’d delight,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And poverty stood smiling in my sight.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But Jove, all-governing, whose only will
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Determines fate, and mingles good with ill,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With roving pirates o’er the Egyptian main
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 20
				-
					-
						By Egypt’s silver flood our ships we moor;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Our spies commission’d straight the coast explore;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But impotent of mind, the lawless will
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The country ravage, and the natives kill.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The spreading clamour to their city flies,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Jove thunder’d on their side: our guilty head
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 29
				-
					-
						We turn’d to flight; the gathering vengeance spread
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 30
				-
					-
						On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Some few the foe in servitude detain;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus’ haughty lord:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Hither, to ’scape his chains, my course I steer,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 35: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Still cursed by Fortune, and insulted here!”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To whom Antinous thus his rage express’d:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest?
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Unless at distance, wretch! thou keep behind,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Another isle, than Cyprus more unkind,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From all thou begg’st, a bold audacious slave;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Shameless they give, who give what’s not their own.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The chief, retiring: “Souls, like that in thee,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor will that hand to utmost need afford
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The smallest portion of a wasteful board,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The haughty suitor with resentment burns,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, sourly smiling, this reply returns:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Take that, ere yet thou quit this princely throng;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue!”
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He said, and high the whirling tripod flung.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Sedate of soul, his character sustain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And inly form’d revenge; then back withdrew:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Before his feet the well fill’d scrip he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thus with semblance mild address’d the crew:

			-

						“Much of the experienced man I long to hear,

					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 1

						To this the queen: “The wanderer let me hear,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 2
				-
					-
						While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Devour the grazing ox, and browsing goat,

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And turn my generous vintage down their throat.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For where’s an arm, like thine, Ulysses! strong,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 47: Verse 6

						To curb wild riot, and to punish wrong?”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 48
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She spoke. Telemachus then sneezed aloud;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Constrain’d, his nostril echoed through the crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 48: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The smiling queen the happy omen bless’d:

			-
				Book 17: Stanza 49
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“So may these impious fall, by Fate oppress’d!”
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Then to Eumaeus: “Bring the stranger, fly!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And if my questions meet a true reply,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Graced with a decent robe he shall retire,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 49: Verse 5

						A gift in season which his wants require.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 50
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus spoke Penelope. Eumaeus flies
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In duteous haste, and to Ulysses cries:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“The queen invites thee, venerable guest!
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A secret instinct moves her troubled breast,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Of her long absent lord from thee to gain
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some light, and soothe her soul’s eternal pain.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of decent robes a present has design’d:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So finding favour in the royal eye,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 50: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy other wants her subjects shall supply.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Fair truth alone (the patient man replied)

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-

						To him, to me, one common lot was given,

					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Much of his fates I know; but check’d by fear
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						I stand; the hand of violence is here:

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Let for a space the pensive queen attend,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor claim my story till the sun descend;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then in such robes as suppliants may require,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Composed and cheerful by the genial fire,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When loud uproar and lawless riot cease,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 51: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain:
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“And say (she cries), does fear or shame detain
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The cautious stranger? With the begging kind
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 52: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shame suits but ill.” Eumaeus thus rejoin’d:
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 53
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“He only asks a more propitious hour,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And shuns (who would not?) wicked men in power;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At evening mild (meet season to confer)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 53: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By turns to question, and by turns to hear.”
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 54
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Whoe’er this guest (the prudent queen replies)
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His every step and every thought is wise.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 3
				-
					-
						For men like these on earth he shall not find
					-

					-
						In all the miscreant race of human kind.”
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus she. Eumaeus all her words attends,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, parting, to the suitor powers descends;
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 54: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart:
					-
			-
				Book 17: Stanza 55
			-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 55: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“The time, my lord, invites me to repair
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care.
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 55: Verse 3
				-
					-
						These sons of murder thirst thy life to take;

						“Thanks to my friend (he cries): but now the hour

				-
					-
						Of night draws on, go seek the rural bower:

				-
					-
						And fed recumbent on a chair of state.

				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 3

					-
						Then instant rose, and as he moved along,
					-
				-
					Book 17: Stanza 57: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Twas riot all amid the suitor throng,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His feet extended quivering, beat the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 17

					-
						His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 14: Verse 18

						His teeth, all shatter’d, rush inmix’d with blood.

					-
						“There terrible, affright with dogs, and reign

						A dreaded tyrant o’er the bestial train!

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The broad-patch’d scrip in tatters hung
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ill join’d, and knotted to a twisted thong.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then, turning short, disdain’d a further stay;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But to the palace measured back the way.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						There, as he rested gathering in a ring,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 7

				-
					-
						“Stranger, may Jove and all the aërial powers

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With every blessing crown thy happy hours!
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Our freedom to thy prowess’d arm we owe
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From bold intrusion of thy coward foe:
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 16: Verse 13

						Untaught to bear, ’gainst Heaven the wretch rebels.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 13

				-
					-
						Too high when prosperous, when distress’d too low.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There was a day, when with the scornful great
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 18: Verse 16

						Who with the queen her years an infant led,

						Thou bold intruder on a princely train?

					-
						Hence, to the vagrants’ rendezvous repair;
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Or shun in some black forge the midnight air.
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Proceeds this boldness from a turn of soul,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Or flows licentious from the copious bowl?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 15

						Is it that vanquish’d Irus swells thy mind?
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 16

				-
					-
						Who, shortening with a storm of blows thy stay,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 36: Verse 18

						His royal hands: each torch refulgent burns
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 3

						With added day: meanwhile in museful mood,

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 4

						Absorb’d in thought, on vengeance fix’d he stood.

						And now the martial maid, by deeper wrongs
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To rouse Ulysses, points the suitors’ tongues:

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 7

					-
						Scornful of age, to taunt the virtuous man,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 39: Verse 8

						Thoughtless and gay, Eurymachus began:

					-
						“Hear me (he cries), confederates and friends!

						The shining baldness of his head survey,

			-
				Book 18: Stanza 41
			-

						Then to the king that levell’d haughty Troy:

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Say, if large hire can tempt thee to employ

				-
					Book 18: Stanza 41: Verse 3

						Those hands in work; to tend the rural trade,

				-
					-
						To dress the walk, and form the embowering shade.
					-
				-

						So food and raiment constant will I give:

					-
						But idly thus thy soul prefers to live,

						“Slave, I with justice might deserve the wrong,

						Irreverent to the great, and uncontroll’d,

				-
					-
						Perhaps these outrages from Irus flow,
					-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 44: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A worthless triumph o’er a worthless foe!”
					-
			-
				Book 18: Stanza 45
			-
				-
					Book 18: Stanza 45: Verse 1
				-

						He said, and with full force a footstool threw;

				-
					-
						Whirl’d from his arm, with erring rage it flew:

						“Gods! what wild folly from the goblet flows!

						Whence this unguarded openness of soul,

						From her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow,

					-
						So, melting with the pleasing tale he told,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 10

					-
						Down her fair cheek the copious torrent roll’d:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 11
				-
					-
						She to her present lord laments him lost,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 12

						And views that object which she wants the most,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Withering at heart to see the weeping fair,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 21: Verse 14

					-
						His eyes look stern, and cast a gloomy stare;

					-
						Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear,

						Or globes of iron fix’d in either sphere;

						Pleased with his wise reply, the queen rejoin’d:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Such gentle manners, and so sage a mind,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In all who graced this hospitable bower
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I ne’er discerned, before this social hour.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Such servant as your humble choice requires,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To light received the lord of my desires,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						New from the birth; and with a mother’s hand
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His tender bloom to manly growth sustain’d:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Of matchless prudence, and a duteous mind;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Though now to life’s extremest verge declined,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Of strength superior to the toil design’d—
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Rise, Euryclea! with officious care
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 14
				-
					-
						This debt his correspondent fortunes claim,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Too like Ulysses, and perhaps the same!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Thus old with woes my fancy paints him now!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 28: Verse 17

						For age untimely marks the careful brow.”

						Instant, obsequious to the mild command,

				-
					-
						Sad Euryclea rose: with trembling hand
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 29: Verse 4

				Book 19: Stanza 30

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Son of my love, and monarch of my cares,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						What pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With pious deed, and pure devotion, paid?
					-

					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He never dared defraud the sacred fane
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of perfect hecatombs in order slain:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There oft implored his tutelary power,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Long to protract the sad sepulchral hour;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That, form’d for empire with paternal care,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 10

					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O destined head! The pious vows are lost;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His God forgets him on a foreign coast!—
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Perhaps, like thee, poor guest! in wanton pride
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The rich insult him, and the young deride!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 15
				-

						Conscious of worth reviled, thy generous mind

						My will concurring with my queen’s command,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Accept the bath from this obsequious hand.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A strong emotion shakes my anguish’d breast:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In thy whole form Ulysses seems express’d;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Of all the wretched harboured on our coast,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 30: Verse 22

						None imaged e’er like thee my master lost.”
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 31
			-

						Thus half-discover’d through the dark disguise,

						With cool composure feign’d, the chief replies:

						“You join your suffrage to the public vote;

					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The laver straight with busy care she brings:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In the deep vase, that shone like burnish’d gold,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The boiling fluid temperates the cold.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Meantime revolving in his thoughtful mind
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The scar, with which his manly knee was sign’d;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His face averting from the crackling blaze,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus cautious in the obscure he hoped to fly
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The curious search of Euryclea’s eye.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Cautious in vain! nor ceased the dame to find
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						This scar with which his manly knee was sign’d.
					-

					-
						This on Parnassus (combating the boar)
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With glancing rage the tusky savage tore.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Attended by his brave maternal race,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His grandsire sent him to the sylvan chase,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Autolycus the bold (a mighty name
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For spotless faith and deeds of martial fame:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hermes, his patron god, those gifts bestow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Whose shrine with weanling lambs he wont to load).
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His course to Ithaca this hero sped,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						When the first product of Laertes’ bed
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Was now disclosed to birth: the banquet ends,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						When Euryclea from the queen descends,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And to his fond embrace the babe commends:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						“Receive (she cries) your royal daughter’s son;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And name the blessing that your prayers have won.”
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then thus the hoary chief: “My victor arms
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Have awed the realms around with dire alarms:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A sure memorial of my dreaded fame
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The boy shall bear; Ulysses be his name!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And when with filial love the youth shall come
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 21
				-
					-
						To view his mother’s soil, my Delphic dome
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With gifts of price shall send him joyous home.”
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Lured with the promised boon, when youthful prime
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Ended in man, his mother’s natal clime
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ulysses sought; with fond affection dear
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Amphitea’s arms received the royal heir:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Her ancient lord an equal joy possess’d;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Instant he bade prepare the genial feast:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 29
				-
					-
						A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Whose stately growth five flowery summers fed:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 31
				-
					-
						His sons divide, and roast with artful care
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The limbs; then all the tasteful viands share.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Nor ceased discourse (the banquet of the soul),
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Till Phœbus wheeling to the western goal
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Resign’d the skies, and night involved the pole.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 33: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Sated they rose, and all retired to rest.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Soon as the morn, new-robed in purple light,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Pierced with her golden shafts the rear of night,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Ulysses, and his brave maternal race,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The young Autolyci, essay the chase.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Parnassus, thick perplex’d with horrid shades,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With deep-mouth’d hounds the hunter-troop invades;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What time the sun, from ocean’s peaceful stream,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Darts o’er the lawn his horizontal beam.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The pack impatient snuff the tainted gale;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The thorny wilds the woodmen fierce assail:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And, foremost of the train, his cornel spear
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ulysses waved, to rouse the savage war.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Deep in the rough recesses of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A lofty copse, the growth of ages, stood;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Nor winter’s boreal blast, nor thunderous shower,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Nor solar ray, could pierce the shady bower.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						With wither’d foliage strew’d, a heapy store!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Roused by the hounds’ and hunters’ mingling cries,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The savage from his leafy shelter flies;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And bristles high impale his horrid chine.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Young Ithacus advanced, defies the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Poising his lifted lance in act to throw;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The savage renders vain the wound decreed,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And springs impetuous with opponent speed!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 27
				-
					-
						His tusks oblique he aim’d, the knee to gore;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Aslope they glanced, the sinewy fibres tore,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And bared the bone; Ulysses undismay’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Soon with redoubled force the wound repaid;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 31
				-
					-
						To the right shoulder-joint the spear applied,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His further flank with streaming purple dyed:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 33
				-
					-
						On earth he rushed with agonizing pain;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 34
				-
					-
						With joy and vast surprise, the applauding train
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 35
				-
					-
						View’d his enormous bulk extended on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 36
				-
					-
						With bandage firm Ulysses’ knee they bound;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Then, chanting mystic lays, the closing wound
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Of sacred melody confess’d the force;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The tides of life regain’d their azure course.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Then back they led the youth with loud acclaim;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Autolycus, enamoured with his fame,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Confirm’d the cure; and from the Delphic dome
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With added gifts return’d him glorious home.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 44
				-
					-
						He safe at Ithaca with joy received,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 34: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Relates the chase, and early praise achieved.
					-
			-
				Book 19: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Deep o’er his knee inseam’d remain’d the scar;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which noted token of the woodland war
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When Euryclea found, the ablution ceased:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Down dropp’d the leg, from her slack hand released;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The mingled fluids from the base redound;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The vase reclining floats the floor around!
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Smiles dew’d with tears the pleasing strife express’d
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of grief and joy, alternate in her breast.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Her fluttering words in melting murmurs died;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 10
				-
					-
						At length abrupt—“My son!—my king!”—she cried.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His neck with fond embrace infolding fast,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Full on the queen her raptured eye she cast
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ardent to speak the monarch safe restored:
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But, studious to conceal her royal lord,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Minerva fix’d her mind on views remote,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And from the present bliss abstracts her thought.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His hand to Euryclea’s mouth applied,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 18
				-
					-
						“Art thou foredoom’d my pest? (the hero cried:)
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Thy milky founts my infant lips have drain’d;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And have the Fates thy babbling age ordain’d
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 21
				-
					-
						To violate the life thy youth sustain’d?
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 22
				-
					-
						An exile have I told, with weeping eyes,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Full twenty annual suns in distant skies;

					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 24
				-
					-
						At length return’d, some god inspires thy breast
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To know thy king, and here I stand confess’d.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 26
				-
					-
						This heaven-discover’d truth to thee consign’d,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Else, if the gods my vengeful arm sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And prostrate to my sword the suitor-train;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 35: Verse 30
				-
					-
						With their lewd mates, thy undistinguish’d age

					-
						“What words, my son, have passed thy lips severe?
					-
				-

						Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With ribs of steel, and marble heart, immured.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When Heaven, auspicious to thy right avow’d,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-

						Shall prostrate to thy sword the suitor-crowd,

				-
					-
						She to the fount conveys the exhausted vase:

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The bath renew’d, she ends the pleasing toil
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 38: Verse 4

					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Though night, dissolving grief in grateful ease,

				-
					-
						Awhile, reluctant to her pleasing force,

				-

						And, unattended by sincere repose,

						Sad Philomel, in bowery shades unseen,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To vernal airs attunes her varied strains;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 14

						And Itylus sounds warbling o’er the plains;

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Young Itylus, his parents’ darling joy!
					-

						Whom chance misled the mother to destroy;

						Now doom’d a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 18

						So in nocturnal solitude forlorn,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And, joining to my son’s my menial train,

				-
					-
						Partake his counsels, and assist his reign?
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Or, since, mature in manhood, he deplores
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 27
				-
					-
						His dome dishonour’d, and exhausted stores;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And from the peers select the noblest lord;
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 39: Verse 30

						So by my choice avow’d, at length decide

					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“A team of twenty geese (a snow-white train!)

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain,

				-
					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove
					-
				-

					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway,
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And back triumphant wing’d his airy way.
					-
				-
					Book 19: Stanza 40: Verse 7
				-
					-
						My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream,
					-
				-

					-
						Perch’d on the battlements he thus began

						The last alone a kind illusion wrought,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 8: Verse 36

					-
						As when for Troy he left my fond embrace;

					Book 20: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-

						“Jove, and eternal thrones! with heaven to friend,

						And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove!

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 11
			-
				-

				-
					-
						The pitying god his guardian aid avows.

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds;

				-
					-
						Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind;

					-
						Task’d for the royal board to bolt the bran

						From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man)

				-

				-
					-
						Discharging to the day the labour due,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 12

					-
						Now early to repose the rest withdrew;

				-
					-
						One maid unequal to the task assign’d,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Still turn’d the toilsome mill with anxious mind;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And thus in bitterness of soul divined:

			-
				Book 20: Stanza 12
			-

					-
						“Father of gods and men, whose thunders roll

					-
						When, early dress’d, advanced the royal heir;

						With manly grasp he waved a martial spear;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A radiant sabre graced his purple zone,

				-
					-
						“Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes,

					-
						(In woes bewilder’d, oft the wisest errs).

				-
					-
						The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires,

					-
						Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A Samian peer, more studious than the rest
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Of vice, who teem’d with many a dead-born jest;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 32: Verse 18

					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“The sentence I propose, ye peers, attend:

					-
						Since due regard must wait the prince’s friend,

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed:

					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Had not the inglorious wound thy malice aim’d

						Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear:

				-
					-
						For genuine worth, of age mature to know,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 17
				-
					-
						My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or, if each other’s wrongs ye still support,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With rapes and riot to profane my court;

						What single arm with numbers can contend?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 34: Verse 21

						On me let all your lifted swords descend,

						And with my life such vile dishonours end.”

				Book 20: Stanza 35

				-
					-
						A long cessation of discourse ensued,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						By gentler Agelaus thus renew’d:

				Book 20: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“A just reproof, ye peers! your rage restrain
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From the protected guest, and menial train:

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And, prince! to stop the source of future ill,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Assent yourself, and gain the royal will.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whilst hope prevail’d to see your sire restored,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of right the queen refused a second lord:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To think he still survives to claim the state?
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 10

						To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire:

				-
					-
						The lord selected to the nuptial joys
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 12
				-

						Far hence will lead the long-contested prize:

				-
					-
						Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless’d,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 36: Verse 14

					-
						“By him at whose behest the thunder flies,

				-
					-
						(Who never must review his dear domain;

						Whene’er her choice the royal dame avows,

				-
					-
						The suitors’ souls, insensate of their doom!
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A mirthful frenzy seized the fated crowd;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The roofs resound with causeless laughter loud;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 38: Verse 5

				-
					-
						Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 38: Verse 8

						And sudden sighs precede approaching woe.

						In vision wrapp’d, the Hyperesian seer

						Each destin’d peer impending fates invade;

					-
						With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drown’d;

						To people Orcus, and the burning coasts!

						His honour’d host, a welcome inmate there.
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 3
				-
					-
						O’er the protracted feast the suitors sit,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And aim to wound the prince with pointless wit:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Cries one, with scornful leer and mimic voice,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“Thy charity we praise, but not thy choice;

				-

				-
					-
						Why such profusion of indulgence shown
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To this poor, timorous, toil-detesting drone?

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That others feeds on planetary schemes,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 10

					-
						And pays his host with hideous noon-day dreams.

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But, prince! for once at least believe a friend;
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To some Sicilian mart these courtiers send,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 42: Verse 13

					-
						Where, if they yield their freight across the main,

						Dear sell the slaves! demand no greater gain.”
					-
			-
				Book 20: Stanza 43
			-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 1
				-

						Thus jovial they; but nought the prince replies;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Full on his sire he roll’d his ardent eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Impatient straight to flesh his virgin-sword;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 4

						From the wise chief he waits the deathful word.

						But vengeful Pallas, with preventing speed,
					-
				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A feast proportion’d to their crimes decreed;

				-
					Book 20: Stanza 43: Verse 11

				-
					-
						At distance due a virgin-train attends;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A brazen key she held, the handle turn’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With steel and polish’d elephant adorn’d:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Swift to the inmost room she bent her way,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where, safe reposed, the royal treasures lay:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						There shone high heap’d the labour’d brass and ore,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And there the bow which great Ulysses bore;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Those winged deaths that many a matron wept.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This gift, long since when Sparta’s shore he trod,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Beneath Orsilochus’ roof they met;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						One loss was private, one a public debt;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Messena’s state from Ithaca detains
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And to the youthful prince to urge the laws,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The king and elders trust their common cause.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But Iphitus, employed on other cares,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Search’d the wide country for his wandering mares,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And mules, the strongest of the labouring kind;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Hapless to search; more hapless still to find!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For journeying on to Hercules, at length
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						That lawless wretch, that man of brutal strength,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Deaf to Heaven’s voice, the social rites transgress’d;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And for the beauteous mares destroy’d his guest.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He gave the bow; and on Ulysses’ part
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Received a pointed sword, and missile dart:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Their first, last pledges! for they met no more.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The bow, bequeath’d by this unhappy hand,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Ulysses bore not from his native land;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor in the front of battle taught to bend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But kept in dear memorial of his friend.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now gently winding up the fair ascent,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						By many an easy step the matron went;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then o’er the pavement glides with grace divine
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(With polish’d oak the level pavements shine);
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 5

						The folding gates a dazzling light display’d,

					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With pomp of various architrave o’erlaid.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The bolt, obedient to the silken string,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The wards respondent to the key turn round;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The bars fall back; the flying valves resound;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So roar’d the lock when it released the spring.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						She moves majestic through the wealthy room,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Where treasured garments cast a rich perfume;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						There from the column where aloft it hung,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Reach’d in its splendid case, the bow unstrung;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Across her knees she laid the well-known bow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And pensive sate, and tears began to flow.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To full satiety of grief she mourns,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then silent to the joyous hall returns,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						To the proud suitors bears in pensive state
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 4: Verse 22

						Behind, her train the polish’d coffer brings,

				-
					-
						Which held the alternate brass and silver rings.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 5: Verse 3

					-
						Full in the portal the chaste queen appears,

					-
						And with her veil conceals the coming tears:

				-
					Book 21: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						On either side awaits a virgin fair;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 5: Verse 6

						While thus the matron, with majestic air:

				Book 21: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Say you, when these forbidden walls inclose,

						If these neglected, faded charms can move?

						If I the prize, if me you seek to wife,

						Graceful she said, and bade Eumaeus show
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The rival peers the ringlets and the bow.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Touch’d at the dear memorials of his king.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Philaetius too relents, but secret shed
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The tender drops. Antinous saw, and said:

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Hence to your fields, ye rustics! hence away,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor to the royal heart recall in vain
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The sad remembrance of a perish’d man.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Enough her precious tears already flow—
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or share the feast with due respect; or go
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						I well remember (for I gazed him o’er
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						While yet a child), what majesty he bore!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And still (all infant as I was) retain
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-

						The port, the strength, the grandeur of the man.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, but in his soul fond joys arise,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And his proud hopes already win the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To speed the flying shaft through every ring,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the king
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing!
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus Telemachus: “Some god I find
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With pleasing frenzy has possess’d my mind;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When a loved mother threatens to depart,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Why with this ill-timed gladness leaps my heart?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Come then, ye suitors! and dispute a prize
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Richer than all the Achaian state supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Than all proud Argos, or Mycaena knows,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Than all our isles or continents inclose;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A woman matchless, and almost divine,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Fit for the praise of every tongue but mine.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						No more excuses then, no more delay;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Haste to the trial—Lo! I lead the way.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“I too may try, and if this arm can wing
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The feather’d arrow through the destined ring,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then if no happier night the conquest boast,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						I shall not sorrow for a mother lost;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But, bless’d in her, possess those arms alone,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Heir of my father’s strength, as well as throne.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke; then rising, his broad sword unbound,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And cast his purple garment on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A trench he open’d: in a line he placed.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The level axes, and the points made fast
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						(His perfect skill the wondering gazers eyed,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The game as yet unseen, as yet untried).
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And grasp’d the bow, and twang’d it in his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Three times, with beating heart, he made essay:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Three times, unequal to the task, gave way;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A modest boldness on his cheek appear’d:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear’d.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His ardour straight the obedient prince suppress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, artful, thus the suitor-train address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“O lay the cause on youth yet immature!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(For heaven forbid such weakness should endure!)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How shall this arm, unequal to the bow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Retort an insult, or repel a foe?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Accept the trial, and the prize contest.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He cast the bow before him, and apart
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Against the polish’d quiver propp’d the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Resuming then his seat, Eupithes’ son,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The bold Antinous, to the rest begun:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“From where the goblet first begins to flow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						From right to left in order take the bow;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And prove your several strengths.” The princes heard
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And first Leiodes, blameless priest, appear’d:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The eldest born of Œnops’ noble race,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who next the goblet held his holy place:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He, only he, of all the suitor throng,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Their deeds detested, and abjured the wrong.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The stubborn horn resisted all his pains!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Already in despair he gives it o’er:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						“Take it who will (he cries), I strive no more,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						What souls and spirits shall it send below!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Better, indeed, to die, and fairly give
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Nature her debt, than disappointed live,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With each new sun to some new hope a prey,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						How long in vain Penelope we sought!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						This bow shall ease us of that idle thought,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And send us with some humbler wife to live,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						(With rich inlay the various floor was graced):
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						At distance far the feather’d shaft he throws,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And to the seat returns from whence he rose.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To him Antinous thus with fury said:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“What words ill-omen’d from thy lips have fled?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy coward-function ever is in fear!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Why should this bow be fatal to the brave?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Because the priest is born a peaceful slave.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Mark then what others can.” He ended there,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He gives it instant flame, then fast beside
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Spreads o’er an ample board a bullock’s hide.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With melted lard they soak the weapon o’er,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Chafe every knot, and supple every pore.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The bow inflexible resists their pain.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The force of great Eurymachus alone
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And bold Antinous, yet untired, unknown:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Those only now remain’d; but those confess’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of all the train the mightiest and the best.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The king observes them, he the hall forsakes,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, past the limits of the court, o’ertakes.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						“Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Shall I the secret of my breast conceal,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Say, should some favouring god restore again
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The lost Ulysses to his native reign,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Philaetius thus: “O were thy word not vain!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Would mighty Jove restore that man again!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						These aged sinews, with new vigour strung,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In his blest cause should emulate the young.”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With equal vows Eumaeus too implored
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each power above, with wishes for his lord.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 19
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He saw their secret souls, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Those vows the gods accord; behold the man!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By woes and wanderings from this hapless land:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At length he comes; but comes despised, unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And finding faithful you, and you alone.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						All else have cast him from their very thought,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						E’en in their wishes and their prayers forgot!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And give yon impious revellers to bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 11
				-
					-
						My care shall be to bless your future lives
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With large possessions and with faithful wives;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And each on young Telemachus attend,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And each be call’d his brother and my friend.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						When with Autolycus’ sons, of yore,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						On Parnass’ top I chased the tusky boar.”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The sign conspicuous, and the scar exposed:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Eager they view’d, with joy they stood amazed
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With tearful eyes o’er all their master gazed:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Around his neck their longing arms they cast,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His head, his shoulders, and his knees embraced;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Tears followed tears; no word was in their power;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						In solemn silence fell the kindly shower.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The king too weeps, the king too grasps their hands;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But first the wise man ceased, and thus begun:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Enough—on other cares your thought employ,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For danger waits on all untimely joy.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Full many foes and fierce, observe us near;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Some moments you, and let me lead the way.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To me, neglected as I am I know
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The haughty suitors will deny the bow;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 11

					-
						But thou, Eumaeus, as ’tis borne away,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thy master’s weapon to his hand convey.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						At every portal let some matron wait,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And each lock fast the well-compacted gate:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Close let them keep, whate’er invades their ear;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To thy strict charge, Philaetius, we consign
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 20: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The court’s main gate: to guard that pass be thine.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, he first return’d; the faithful swains
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At distance follow, as their king ordains.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Before the flame Eurymachus now stands,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Still the tough bow unmoved. The lofty man
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 21: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sigh’d from his mighty soul, and thus began:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“I mourn the common cause: for, oh, my friends,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 2
				-
					-
						On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not the lost nuptials can affect me more
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore),
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But baffled thus! confess’d so far below
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ulysses’ strength, as not to bend his bow!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						How shall all ages our attempt deride!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 22: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Our weakness scorn!” Antinous thus replied:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The wondrous bow, attend another cause.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Sacred to Phœbus is the solemn day,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Which thoughtless we in games would waste away:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Till the next dawn this ill-timed strife forego,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In due libations, and in rites divine,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So end our night: before the day shall spring,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Let then to Phœbus’ name the fatted thighs
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 13
				-
					-
						So shall the patron of these arts bestow
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 23: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 24
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 1
				-
					-
						They heard well pleased: the ready heralds bring
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The cleansing waters from the limpid spring:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The goblet high with rosy wine they crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In order circling to the peers around.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus his meditated scheme began:
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“If what I ask your noble minds approve,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Chief, if it hurt not great Antinous’ ear
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Whose sage decision I with wonder hear),
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And if Eurymachus the motion please:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And take it he, the favour’d of the skies!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But, since till then this trial you delay,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Trust it one moment to my hands to-day:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						What once I was, whom wretched you despise:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						If yet this arm its ancient force retain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or if my woes (a long-continued train)
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 25: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And wants and insults, make me less than man.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 26
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Rage flash’d in lightning from the suitors’ eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Antinous then: “O miserable guest!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Is common sense quite banish’d from thy breast?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sufficed it not, within the palace placed,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To sit distinguish’d, with our presence graced,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Admitted here with princes to confer,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A man unknown, a needy wanderer?
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To copious wine this insolence we owe,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And much thy betters wine can overthrow:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The great Eurytian when this frenzy stung,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pirithous’ roofs with frantic riot rung;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Boundless the Centaur raged; till one and all
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The heroes rose, and dragg’d him from the hall;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His nose they shorten’d, and his ears they slit,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And sent him sober’d home, with better wit.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Hence with long war the double race was cursed,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Such fate I prophesy our guest attends,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 20
				-
					-
						If here this interdicted bow he bends:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nor shall these walls such insolence contain:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The first fair wind transports him o’er the main,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 23

					-
						Where Echetus to death the guilty brings

				-
					-
						(The worst of mortals, e’en the worst of kings).
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Better than that, if thou approve our cheer;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 26: Verse 26

						Cease the mad strife and share our bounty here.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 27: Verse 1

						To this the queen her just dislike express’d:

			-
				Book 21: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“‘Tis impious, prince, to harm the stranger-guest,

				-
					-
						Base to insult who bears a suppliant’s name,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And some respect Telemachus may claim.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-

						What if the immortals on the man bestow

						Then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain.

						Far be he banish’d from this stately scene

						“Hear what Telemachus enjoins (he cried):

						Her prompt obedience on his order waits;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Closed in an instant were the palace gates.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In the same moment forth Philaetius flies,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Secures the court, and with a cable ties
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The utmost gate (the cable strongly wrought
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of Byblos’ reed, a ship from Egypt brought);
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then unperceived and silent at the board
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 35: Verse 8

						His seat he takes, his eyes upon his lord.
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now his well-known bow the master bore,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Turn’d on all sides, and view’d it o’er and o’er;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Its owner absent, and untried so long.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						While some deriding—“How he turns the bow!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some other like it sure the man must know,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or else would copy; or in bows he deals;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals.”
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“Heaven to this wretch (another cried) be kind!
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And bless, in all to which he stands inclined.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 36: Verse 11
				-

						With such good fortune as he now shall find.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Heedless he heard them: but disdain’d reply;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The bow perusing with exactest eye.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then, as some heavenly minstrel, taught to sing
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High notes responsive to the trembling string,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						To some new strain when he adapts the lyre,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So the great master drew the mighty bow,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And drew with ease. One hand aloft display’d
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The bending horns, and one the string essay’d.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From his essaying hand the string, let fly,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Twang’d short and sharp like the shrill swallow’s cry.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						A general horror ran through all the race,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Sunk was each heart, and pale was every face,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Signs from above ensued: the unfolding sky
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In lightning burst; Jove thunder’d from on high.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fired at the call of heaven’s almighty Lord,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He snatch’d the shaft that glitter’d on the board
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						(Fast by, the rest lay sleeping in the sheath,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But soon to fly the messengers of death).
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now sitting as he was, the cord he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through every ringlet levelling his view:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then notch’d the shaft, released, and gave it wing;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The whizzing arrow vanished from the string,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sung on direct, and threaded every ring.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then to the prince: “Nor have I wrought thee shame;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor err’d this hand unfaithful to its aim;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor prov’d the toil too hard; nor have I lost
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 11
				-
					-
						That ancient vigour, once my pride and boast.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Ill I deserved these haughty peers’ disdain;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now let them comfort their dejected train,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In sweet repast their present hour employ,
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Nor wait till evening for the genial joy:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then to the lute’s soft voice prolong the night;
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 38: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Music, the banquet’s most refined delight.”
					-
			-
				Book 21: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He said, then gave a nod; and at the word
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Telemachus girds on his shining sword.
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fast by his father’s side he takes his stand:
					-
				-
					Book 21: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The beamy javelin lightens in his hand.

						Then fierce the hero o’er the threshold strode;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stripp’d of his rags, he blazed out like a god.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full in their face the lifted bow he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And quiver’d deaths, a formidable store;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before his feet the rattling shower he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“One venturous game this hand hath won to-day,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Another, princes! yet remains to play;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Another mark our arrow must attain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Phœbus, assist! nor be the labour vain.”
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Swift as the word the parting arrow sings,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						High in his hands he rear’d the golden bowl!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						E’en then to drain it lengthen’d out his breath;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Changed to the deep, the bitter draught of death:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For fate who fear’d amidst a feastful band?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And fate to numbers, by a single hand?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Full through his throat Ulysses’ weapon pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And pierced his neck. He falls, and breathes his last.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The tumbling goblet the wide floor o’erflows,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Before him spurn’d the loaded table falls,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Amazed, confounded, as they saw him fall,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Up rose the throngs tumultuous round the hall:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						O’er all the dome they cast a haggard eye,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Each look’d for arms—in vain; no arms were nigh:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						“Aim’st thou at princes? (all amazed they said;)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thy last of games unhappy hast thou play’d;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And death, unlucky guest, attends thy deed.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Vultures shall tear thee.” Thus incensed they spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						While each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Blind as they were: for death e’en now invades
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His destined prey, and wraps them all in shades.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Then, grimly frowning, with a dreadful look,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						That wither’d all their hearts, Ulysses spoke:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Dogs, ye have had your day! ye fear’d no more

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						While, to your lust and spoil a guardless prey,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not so content, with bolder frenzy fired,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						E’en to our bed presumptuous you aspired:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Laws or divine or human fail’d to move,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or shame of men, or dread of gods above;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Heedless alike of infamy or praise,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or Fame’s eternal voice in future days;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Impending fate is yours, and instant doom.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus dreadful he. Confused the suitors stood,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“If, as thy words import (he thus began),
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain’d
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						In thy spoil’d palace, and exhausted land;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The cause and author of those guilty deeds,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not love, but wild ambition was his guide;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To slay thy son, thy kingdom to divide,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						These were his aims; but juster Jove denied.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Since cold in death the offender lies, oh spare
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thy suppliant people, and receive their prayer!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Brass, gold, and treasures, shall the spoil defray,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The waste of years refunded in a day.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Till then thy wrath is just.” Ulysses burn’d
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With high disdain, and sternly thus return’d:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“All, all the treasure that enrich’d our throne
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Before your rapines, join’d with all your own,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						If offer’d, vainly should for mercy call;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						’Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						This choice is left you, to resist or die:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And die I trust ye shall.” He sternly spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With guilty fears the pale assembly shook.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						“Yon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But from the threshold shall his darts be sped,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(Whoe’er he be), till every prince lie dead?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Be mindful of yourselves, draw forth your swords,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And to his shafts obtend these ample boards
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						(So need compels). Then, all united, strive
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The bold invader from his post to drive:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The city roused shall to our rescue haste,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And this mad archer soon have shot his last.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Swift as he spoke, he drew his traitor sword,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And like a lion rush’d against his lord:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The wary chief the rushing foe repress’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who met the point and forced it in his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His falling hand deserts the lifted sword,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And prone he falls extended o’er the board!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Before him wide, in mix’d effusion roll
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The untasted viands, and the jovial bowl.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Full through his liver pass’d the mortal wound,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With dying rage his forehead beats the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He spurn’d the seat with fury as he fell,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And the fierce soul to darkness dived, and hell.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To force the pass; the godlike man defends.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thy spear, Telemachus, prevents the attack,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The brazen weapon driving through his back.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor,
					-

						He left his javelin in the dead, for fear

					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The long encumbrance of the weighty spear
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 22

						To the fierce foe advantage might afford,

						To rush between and use the shorten’d sword.

						With speedy ardour to his sire he flies,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 25

					-
						And, “Arm, great father! arm (in haste he cries).

						Lo, hence I run for other arms to wield,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						For missive javelins, and for helm and shield;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Fast by our side let either faithful swain
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 7: Verse 29

						In arms attend us, and their part sustain.”

						With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						At once in brazen panoply they shone.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 6

				-
					-
						Around their king a faithful guard they stand.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 8

					-
						While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Chief after chief expired at every wound,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 10

					-
						And swell’d the bleeding mountain on the ground.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Soon as his store of flying fates was spent.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Against the wall he set the bow unbent;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And now his shoulders bear the massy shield,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And now his hands two beamy javelins wield:

				-

						He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play’d

				-

				-
					-
						From o’er the porch appear’d the subject town.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						A double strength of valves secured the place,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A high and narrow, but the only pass:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The cautious king, with all-preventing care,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To guard that outlet, placed Eumaeus there;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When Agelaus thus: “Has none the sense
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To mount yon window, and alarm from thence
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The neighbour-town? the town shall force the door,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more.”

						Melanthius then: “That outlet to the gate

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						So near adjoins, that one may guard the strait.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But other methods of defence remain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Myself with arms can furnish all the train;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Stores from the royal magazine I bring,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 10: Verse 16

				Book 22: Stanza 11

						He said; and mounting up the lofty stairs,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Twelve shields, twelve lances, and twelve helmets bears:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						All arm, and sudden round the hall appears
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 11: Verse 4

						And hence the villain has supplied their war.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 5

					-
						Run, good Eumaeus, then, and (what before
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						I thoughtless err’d in) well secure that door:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Learn, if by female fraud this deed were done,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To the high chamber stole the faithless swain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Not unobserved. Eumaeus watchful eyed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thus address’d Ulysses near his side:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“The miscreant we suspected takes that way;

				-

				-
					-
						Him, if this arm be powerful, shall I slay?
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Or drive him hither, to receive the meed
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From thy own hand, of this detested deed?”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-

						“Not so (replied Ulysses); leave him there,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						For us sufficient is another care;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Within the structure of this palace wall

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 16: Verse 9

				-
					-
						Behind the felon unperceived they pass’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As round the room in quest of arms he goes
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(The half-shut door conceal’d his lurking foes):
					-
				-

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 7

				-
					-
						The brass corroded, and the leather torn.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thus laden, o’er the threshold as he stepp’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Fierce on the villain from each side they leap’d,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew,
					-
				-

					-
						At every point their master’s rigid will;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Then straighten’d cords involved his body round;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The howling felon swung from side to side.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 18
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 1

						Eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“There pass thy pleasing night, O gentle swain!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						On that soft pillow, from that envied height,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						First may’st thou see the springing dawn of light;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So timely rise, when morning streaks the east,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To drive thy victims to the suitors’ feast.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 19
			-

				-
					-
						This said, they, left him, tortured as he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Secured the door, and hasty strode away:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Each, breathing death, resumed his dangerous post
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Near great Ulysses; four against an host,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When lo! descending to her hero’s aid,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Jove’s daughter, Pallas, War’s triumphant maid:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In Mentor’s friendly form she join’d his side:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 19: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ulysses saw, and thus with transport cried:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 20
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Come, ever welcome, and thy succour lend;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O every sacred name in one, my friend!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Early we loved, and long our loves have grown;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whate’er through life’s whole series I have done,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or good, or grateful, now to mind recall,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 20: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, aiding this one hour, repay it all.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 21
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus he; but pleasing hopes his bosom warm
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Of Pallas latent in the friendly form.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The adverse host the phantom-warrior eyed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 21: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And first, loud-threatening, Agelaus cried:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 22
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Mentor, beware, nor let that tongue persuade

				-
					-
						Thy frantic arm to lend Ulysses aid;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Our force successful shall our threat make good,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 22: Verse 4

						What hopest thou here? Thee first the sword shall slay,

					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 23
			-

					-
						His barbarous insult even the goddess fires,

						Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires:

						“Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find

					-
						That courage, once the Trojans’ daily dread,

					-
						Known nine long years, and felt by heroes dead?

						Of Priam’s race, and laid proud Troy in dust?
					-
				-

						If this, when Helen was the cause, were done;

			-
				Book 22: Stanza 25

						The sire and son’s great acts withheld the day!

						The rest must perish, their great leader slain:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 28
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then all at once their mingled lances threw,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And thirsty all of one man’s blood they flew;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In vain! Minerva turned them with her breath,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And scattered short, or wide, the points of death!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With deaden’d sound one on the threshold falls,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 6
				-
					-
						One strikes the gate, one rings against the walls:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The storm passed innocent. The godlike man
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Now loftier trod, and dreadful thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“‘Tis now (brave friends) our turn, at once to throw,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 10
				-
					-
						(So speed them Heaven) our javelins at the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 11
				-
					-
						That impious race to all their past misdeeds
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 28: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Would add our blood, injustice still proceeds.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 29
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He spoke: at once their fiery lances flew:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Great Demoptolemus Ulysses slew;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Euryades received the prince’s dart;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The goatherd’s quiver’d in Pisander’s heart;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Fierce Elatus by thine, Eumaeus, falls;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their fall in thunder echoes round the walls.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The rest retreat: the victors now advance,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Again the foe discharge the steely shower;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Again made frustrate by the virgin-power.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Some, turn’d by Pallas, on the threshold fall,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Some wound the gate, some ring against the wall;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Some weak, or ponderous with the brazen head,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 29: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Drop harmless on the pavement, sounding dead.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 30
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy hand, Telemachus, it lightly razed:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And from Ctesippus’ arm the spear elanced:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						On good Eumaeus’ shield and shoulder glanced;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Not lessened of their force (so light the wound)
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each sung along and dropped upon the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Fate doom’d thee next, Eurydamus, to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thy death ennobled by Ulysses’ spear.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						By the bold son Amphimedon was slain,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And Polybus renown’d, the faithful swain.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Pierced through the breast the rude Ctesippus bled,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 30: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And thus Philaetius gloried o’er the dead:
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 31
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“There end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 2
				-
					-
						O sharp in scandal, voluble and vain!
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						How weak is mortal pride! To Heaven alone
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The event of actions and our fates are known:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Scoffer, behold what gratitude we bear:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The victim’s heel is answered with this spear.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 32
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ulysses brandish’d high his vengeful steel,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And Damastorides that instant fell:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fast by Leocritus expiring lay,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The prince’s javelin tore its bloody way
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Through all his bowels: down he tumbled prone,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His batter’d front and brains besmear the stone.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now Pallas shines confess’d; aloft she spreads
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The arm of vengeance o’er their guilty heads:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The dreadful aegis blazes in their eye:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Amazed they see, they tremble, and they fly:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Confused, distracted, through the rooms they fling:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Like oxen madden’d by the breeze’s sting,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						When sultry days, and long, succeed the gentle spring,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Not half so keen fierce vultures of the chase
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Stoop from the mountains on the feather’d race,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						When, the wide field extended snares beset,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						With conscious dread they shun the quivering net:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						No help, no flight; but wounded every way,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Headlong they drop; the fowlers seize their prey.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						On all sides thus they double wound on wound,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And a red deluge floats the reeking stone.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Leiodes first before the victor falls:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The wretched augur thus for mercy calls:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“Oh gracious hear, nor let thy suppliant bleed;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Still undishonoured, or by word or deed,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thy house, for me remains; by me repress’d
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Full oft was check’d the injustice of the rest:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Averse they heard me when I counselled well,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Their hearts were harden’d, and they justly fell.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 9
				-
					-
						O spare an augur’s consecrated head,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 34: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 35

						“Priest as thou art! for that detested band

				-
					-
						Thy lying prophecies deceived the land;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 35: Verse 3

						Against Ulysses have thy vows been made,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 35: Verse 4

					-
						For them thy daily orisons were paid:

						Yet more, e’en to our bed thy pride aspires:

						One common crime one common fate requires.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 36
			-

						Thus speaking, from the ground the sword he took
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which Agelaus’ dying hand forsook:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Full through his neck the weighty falchion sped;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Along the pavement roll’d the muttering head.

						Phemius the sweet, the heaven-instructed bard.

						Beside the gate the reverend minstrel stands;

					-
						The lyre now silent trembling in his hands;

						Dubious to supplicate the chief, or fly

						To Jove’s inviolable altar nigh,

						Where oft Laertes holy vows had paid,

						And oft Ulysses smoking victims laid.

						Between the laver and the silver throne;

					-
						Then prostrate stretch’d before the dreadful man,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 37: Verse 12

						Persuasive thus, with accent soft began:

						A deed like this thy future fame would wrong,

						’Tis thine to merit, mine is to record.

						That here I sung, was force, and not desire;

				-
					-
						This hand reluctant touch’d the warbling wire;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 38: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And let thy son attest, nor sordid pay,

						Swift at the word he cast his screen aside,

					-
						Sprung to the prince, embraced his knee with tears,

						“Be bold, on friendship and my son rely;

						How much more safe the good than evil deed:

						From the dire scene the exempted two withdraw,

						So, when by hollow shores the fisher-train

				-
					-
						Sweep with their arching nets the roaring main,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 7

					-
						And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 8
				-
					-
						All naked of their element, and bare,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 43: Verse 9

						Old Euryclea to the deathful hall:

						The son observant not a moment stays;

						The sounding portals instant they display;

						All black with dust, and cover’d thick with blood.

						So the grim lion from the slaughter comes,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 46: Verse 3

						To insult the dead is cruel and unjust;

						Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust.

						Nor heeded these the censure of mankind,

						And each now wails an unlamented shade.

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 46: Verse 9

						But thou sincere! O Euryclea, say,

			-
				Book 22: Stanza 47
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 1

						Then she: “In these thy kingly walls remain

				-
					-
						(My son) full fifty of the handmaid train,

				-

					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 15
				-
					-
						“Now to dispose the dead, the care remains

						Stretch’d in a long oblivion of their lust.”
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 25
				-
					-
						He said: the lamentable train appear,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Each vents a groan, and drops a tender tear;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Each heaved her mournful burden, and beneath
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 28

					-
						The porch deposed the ghastly heap of death.

					-
						The chief severe, compelling each to move,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Urged the dire task imperious from above;

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o’er

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 32
				-
					-
						(The swains unite their toil); the walls, the floor,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Wash’d with the effusive wave, are purged of gore.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 34
				-

						Once more the palace set in fair array,

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 35

						To the base court the females take their way;

						There compass’d close between the dome and wall

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 47: Verse 37

						(Their life’s last scene) they trembling wait their fall.

			-
				Book 22: Stanza 48

						Then thus the prince: “To these shall we afford

				-
					-
						A fate so pure as by the martial sword?
					-
				-

						To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame,

						Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A ship’s tough cable from a column hung;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Near the high top he strain’d it strongly round,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whence no contending foot could reach the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Their heads above connected in a row,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 6
				-
					-
						They beat the air with quivering feet below:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 49: Verse 9

						Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind

			-
				Book 22: Stanza 50
			-

					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then forth they led Melanthius, and began
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Their bloody work; they lopp’d away the man,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Morsel for dogs! then trimm’d with brazen shears
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The wretch, and shorten’d of his nose and ears;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He roar’d, and torments gave his soul to hell.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 7
				-
					-
						They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 50: Verse 8
				-
					-
						So ends the bloody business of the day.
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 51
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To Euryclea then address’d the king:

				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To purge the palace: then the queen attend,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And let her with her matron-train descend;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The matron-train, with all the virgin-band,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 51: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Assemble here, to learn their lord’s command.”
					-
			-
				Book 22: Stanza 52
			-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Euryclea: “Joyful I obey,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But cast those mean dishonest rags away;
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Permit me first the royal robes to bring:
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 4

					-
						Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king.”
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 5
				-
					-
						“Bring sulphur straight, and fire” (the monarch cries).
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 6
				-
					-
						She hears, and at the word obedient flies.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Again the matron springs with eager pace,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And spreads her lord’s return from place to place.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 11
				-
					-
						They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand,
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A gazing throng, a torch in every hand.
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace
					-
				-
					Book 22: Stanza 52: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Each humbly kiss’d his knee, or hand, or face;

						He knows them all, in all such truth appears,

						Plough’d half his thigh; I saw, I saw the scar,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And wild with transport had reveal’d the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But ere I spoke, he rose, and check’d the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then, daughter, haste away! and if a lie
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die!”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To whom with dubious joy the queen replies:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						“Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The works of gods what mortal can survey?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But learn we instant how the suitors trod
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The paths of death, by man, or by a god.”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But with alternate joy and fear descends;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						At every step debates her lord to prove;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Or, rushing to his arms, confess her love!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then gliding through the marble valves, in state
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Opposed, before the shining sire she sate.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The monarch, by a column high enthroned,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						His eye withdrew, and fix’d it on the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Curious to hear his queen the silence break:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Amazed she sate, and impotent to speak;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						O’er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						At length Telemachus: “Oh, who can find
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						A woman like Penelope unkind?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Why thus in silence? why with winning charms
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						When twice ten years are pass’d of mighty woes;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						To softness lost, to spousal love unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The gods have formed that rigid heart of stone!”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						“O my Telemachus! (the queen rejoin’d,)
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Distracting fears confound my labouring mind;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Powerless to speak. I scarce uplift my eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Nor dare to question; doubts on doubts arise.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Oh deign he, if Ulysses, to remove
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 42
				-
					-
						These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove!”
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Pleased with her virtuous fears, the king replies:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 44
				-
					-
						“Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 46
				-
					-
						This garb of poverty belies the king:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 47
				-
					-
						No more. This day our deepest care requires,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Cautious to act what thought mature inspires.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 49
				-
					-
						If one man’s blood, though mean, distain our hands,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The homicide retreats to foreign lands;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 51
				-
					-
						By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 8: Verse 52

					-
						The important deed our whole attention calls.”

						The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise;

						For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 9: Verse 4

						While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings,

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 11
			-

						Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey,

					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At once they bathe, and dress in proud array:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The voice, attuned to instrumental sounds,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Ascends the roof, the vaulted roof rebounds;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Not unobserved: the Greeks eluded say,

				-
					-
						“Lo! the queen weds, we hear the spousal lay!
					-
				-

						Thus they—but nobly chaste she weds no more.

					-
						With faithful cares Eurynome attends,

						O’er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds;

						More high he treads, and issuing forth in state,

						Radiant before his gazing consort sate.

						Haste, from the bridal bower the bed translate,

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 14
			-

					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Vast as some mighty column’s bulk, on high
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The huge trunk rose, and heaved into the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Around the tree I raised a nuptial bower,

					-
						And roof’d defensive of the storm and shower;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The spacious valve, with art inwrought conjoins;

				-
					-
						And the fair dome with polished marble shines.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						I lopp’d the branchy head: aloft in twain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Sever’d the bole, and smoothed the shining grain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And bore it, regular, from space to space:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Athwart the frame, at equal distance lie
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 14: Verse 22

						Then polishing the whole, the finished mould

						With silver shone, with elephant, and gold.

						Or still inviolate the olive stands,

						’Tis thine, O queen, to say, and now impart,

				-
					-
						That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed:

						Blind to the ills that from injustice flow,

						Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears.

						As to the shipwreck’d mariner, the shores

					-
						Delightful rise, when angry Neptune roars:

					-
						Then, when the surge in thunder mounts the sky,

						When thou must learn what I must speak with tears?
					-
				-

						Around the dome and artificial day;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 5

						Then to repose her steps the matron bends,

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 21: Verse 9
				-

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 22

						But in discourse the king and consort lay,

					-
						While the soft hours stole unperceived away;

					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Intent he hears Penelope disclose
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 6

						A mournful story of domestic woes,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His servants’ insults, his invaded bed,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 8

					-
						How his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His generous wines dishonour’d shed in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the wild riots of the suitor-train.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The king alternate a dire tale relates,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of wars, of triumphs, and disastrous fates;

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 13
				-
					-
						All he unfolds; his listening spouse turns pale
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Sleepless devours each word; and hears how slain
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Cicons on Cicons swell the ensanguined plain;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 17
				-
					-
						How to the land of Lote unbless’d he sails;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And images the rills and flowery vales!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 19
				-
					-
						How dash’d like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(Not unrevenged), and quaff’d the spouting gore;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 21
				-
					-
						How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 22
				-
					-
						From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And whirls him groaning from his native shores:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 25
				-
					-
						How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 26
				-
					-
						By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 27
				-
					-
						How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The spells of Circe, and her magic power;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His dreadful journey to the realms beneath,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To seek Tiresias in the vales of death;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 31
				-
					-
						How in the doleful mansions lie survey’d
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His royal mother, pale Anticlea’s shade;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts!
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Then how, unharm’d, he pass’d the Syren-coasts,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The cave of death! How his companions slay
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The oxen sacred to the god of day.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 41
				-
					-
						How struggling through the surge he reach’d the shores
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Of fair Ogygia and Calypso’s bowers;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Where the gay blooming nymph constrain’d his stay,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 44
				-
					-
						With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And promised, vainly promised, to bestow
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Immortal life, exempt from age and woe:
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 47
				-
					-
						How saved from storms Phæacia’s coast he trod,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 48
				-
					-
						By great Alcinous honour’d as a god,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Who gave him last his country to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 22: Verse 50
				-
					-
						With change of raiment, brass, and heaps of gold
					-
			-
				Book 23: Stanza 23
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 23: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He ended, sinking into sleep, and shares
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 23: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares.
					-

				Book 23: Stanza 24

						Soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day,

				-
					-
						Minerva rushes through the aërial way,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And bids Aurora with her golden wheels
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 4

					-
						Flame from the ocean o’er the eastern hills;

						Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 24: Verse 6

						And thus with thought mature the monarch said:

				Book 23: Stanza 25
			-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“My queen, my consort! through a length of years
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 2
				-
					-
						We drank the cup of sorrow mix’d with tears;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thou, for thy lord; while me the immortal powers
					-

						Detain’d reluctant from my native shores.

					-
						Now, bless’d again by Heaven, the queen display,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And rule our palace with an equal sway.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But now I haste to bless Laertes’ eyes
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies;
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The good old man, to wasting woes a prey,
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Weeps a sad life in solitude away.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But hear, though wise! This morning shall unfold
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 25: Verse 14

					-
						The deathful scene, on heroes heroes roll’d.
					-
				-

			-
				Book 23: Stanza 26

				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 1

					-
						He spoke, and sheathed in arms incessant flies
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 2

					-
						To wake his son, and bid his friends arise.
					-
				-
					Book 23: Stanza 26: Verse 3

						Careful he treasured in a private room;

				-
					-
						Then to her suitors bade his queen propose

						The archer’s strife, the source of future woes,

					-
						And omen of our death! In vain we drew

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 7: Verse 24

					-
						The twanging string, and tried the stubborn yew:

						Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood;

					Book 24: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 7: Verse 31

						First bleeds Antinous: thick the shafts resound,

					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 5

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 7

						There stood his mansion of the rural sort,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With useful buildings round the lowly court;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Where the few servants that divide his care
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-

						Took their laborious rest, and homely fare;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 11

					-
						And one Sicilian matron, old and sage,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 10: Verse 12

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 11

				-
					-
						“Enter the house, and of the bristly swine

					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 4

				-

						Alone, and unattended, let me try
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						If yet I share the old man’s memory:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						(Their light and dearest object long ago),
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now changed with time, with absence and with woe.”
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then to his train he gives his spear and shield;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The house they enter; and he seeks the field,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Through rows of shade, with various fruitage crown’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And labour’d scenes of richest verdure round.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Nor servants, absent on another care;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 12
			-

					-
						But all alone the hoary king he found;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His habit course, but warmly wrapp’d around;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						His head, that bow’d with many a pensive care,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His buskins old, in former service torn,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But swell repair’d; and gloves against the thorn.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						In this array the kingly gardener stood,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And clear’d a plant, encumber’d with its wood.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divine
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Gazed o’er his sire, retracing every line,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The ruins of himself, now worn away
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With age, yet still majestic in decay!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sudden his eyes released their watery store;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The much-enduring man could bear no more.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Doubtful he stood, if instant to embrace
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His aged limbs, to kiss his reverend face,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With eager transport to disclose the whole,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And pour at once the torrent of his soul.—
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not so: his judgment takes the winding way
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of question distant, and of soft essay;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						More gentle methods on weak age employs:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then, to his sire with beating heart he moves,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And with a tender pleasantry reproves;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Nor aught remits the work, while thus he said:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thy careful hand is stamp’d on all the soil,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thy squadron’d vineyards well thy art declare,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And not one empty spot escapes thy care.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On every plant and tree thy cares are shown,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Nothing neglected, but thyself alone.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						I read a monarch in that princely air,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The same thy aspect, if the same thy care;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						These are the rights of age, and should be thine.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Who then thy master, say? and whose the land
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						So dress’d and managed by thy skilful hand?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						For so reported the first man I view’d
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						(Some surly islander, of manners rude),
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But thou whom years have taught to understand,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Humanely hear, and answer my demand:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Time was (my fortunes then were at the best)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						When at my house I lodged this foreign guest;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						He said, from Ithaca’s fair isle he came,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And old Laertes was his father’s name.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 32
				-
					-
						To him, whatever to a guest is owed
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 33
				-
					-
						I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow’d:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 34
				-
					-
						To him seven talents of pure ore I told,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunics stiff with gold:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 36
				-
					-
						A bowl, that rich with polish’d silver flames,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 14: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And skill’d in female works, four lovely dames.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						At this the father, with a father’s fears

				-
					-
						(His venerable eyes bedimm’d with tears):

					-
						Thy ancient friend, O stranger, is no more!

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Full recompense thy bounty else had borne:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						For every good man yields a just return:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 9

						So civil rights demand; and who begins

						The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 11

					-
						But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						What years have circled since thou saw’st that guest?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 14

						Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son!

						If ever man to misery was born,

						Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear,

						Or screaming vultures scatter through the air:

					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Nor wail’d his father o’er the untimely dead:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 15: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Seal’d his cold eyes, or dropp’d a tender tear!

				-
					-
						And all the wing’d good omens of the skies.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore,
					-
				-

						Whom Heaven, alas! decreed to meet no more.”

				-
					-
						Quick through the father’s heart these accents ran;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Grief seized at once, and wrapp’d up all the man:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Deep from his soul he sigh’d, and sorrowing spread
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A cloud of ashes on his hoary head.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Trembling with agonies of strong delight
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He ran, he seized him with a strict embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With thousand kisses wander’d o’er his face:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						“I, I am he; O father, rise! behold
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Thy son, so long desired, so long detain’d,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Restored, and breathing in his native land:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						These floods of sorrow, O my sire, restrain!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The vengeance is complete; the suitor train,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Stretch’d in our palace, by these hands lie slain.”

			-
				Book 24: Stanza 19
			-

						To every plant in order as we came,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 10

					-
						Well-pleased, you told its nature and its name,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whate’er my childish fancy ask’d, bestow’d:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Twelve pear-trees, bowing with their pendent load,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And ten, that red with blushing apples glow’d;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Full fifty purple figs; and many a row
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Of various vines that then began to blow,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 20: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A future vintage! when the Hours produce

						Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice.”

				Book 24: Stanza 21
			-

						Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain,

						He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys oppress’d:

						Our shores with death, and push’d the slaughter on;

				-
					-
						The swains, fatigued with labours of the day:

				-
					-
						Dolius, the first, the venerable man;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And next his sons, a long succeeding train.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 5
				-
					-
						For due refection to the bower they came,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Call’d by the careful old Sicilian dame,

						Who nursed the children, and now tends the sire,

				-
					-
						On chairs and beds in order seated round,

						They share the gladsome board; the roofs resound,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 11
				-

						While thus Ulysses to his ancient friend:

				-
					-
						“Forbear your wonder, and the feast attend:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The rites have waited long.” The chief commands
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Their love in vain; old Dolius spreads his hands,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Springs to his master with a warm embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 24: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And fastens kisses on his hands and face;

				-
					-
						Then thus broke out: “O long, O daily mourn’d!

				-
					-
						To the chaste queen shall we the news convey?

				-
					-
						Already is it known” (the king replied,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And straight resumed his seat); while round him bows
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows:

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then all beneath their father take their place,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 25: Verse 6

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Through all the city, of the suitors dead,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In throngs they rise, and to the palace crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their sighs were many and the tumult loud.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain;

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Inhume the natives in their native plain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The rest in ships are wafted o’er the main.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then sad in council all the seniors sate,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Frequent and full, assembled to debate:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Amid the circle first Eupithes rose,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Big was his eye with tears, his heart with woes:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The bold Antinous was his age’s pride,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The first who by Ulysses’ arrow died.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 26: Verse 15
				-
					-
						As mixing words with sighs he thus began:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 27
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Great deeds, O friends! this wondrous man has wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And mighty blessings to his country brought!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With ships he parted, and a numerous train,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Those, and their ships, he buried in the main.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now he returns, and first essays his hand
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 6
				-
					-
						In the best blood of all his native land.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Haste, then, and ere to neighbouring Pyle he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or sacred Elis, to procure supplies;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Arise (or ye for ever fall), arise!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Shame to this age, and all that shall succeed!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 11
				-
					-
						If unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Prove that we live, by vengeance on his head,

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Or sink at once forgotten with the dead.”
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Here ceased he, but indignant tears let fall
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Spoke when he ceased: dumb sorrow touch’d them all.

				-
					-
						When from the palace to the wondering throng
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 27: Verse 17

						Who now before him, now beside him stood,

						Fought as he fought, and mark’d his way with blood:

						In vain old Mentor’s form the god belied;

				-
					-
						When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 29: Verse 3
				-
					-
						(Reverend and wise, whose comprehensive view

						They storm, they shout, with hasty frenzy fired,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And second all Eupithes’ rage inspired.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They case their limbs in brass; to arms they run;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The broad effulgence blazes in the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Before the city, and in ample plain,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 8
				-
					-
						They meet: Eupithes heads the frantic train.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 30: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fierce for his son, he breathes his threats in air;

				-
					-
						Fate bears them not, and Death attends him there.

						This pass’d on earth, while in the realms above

				-
					-
						Minerva thus to cloud-compelling Jove!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 31: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“May I presume to search thy secret soul?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 31: Verse 4
				-
					-
						O Power Supreme, O Ruler of the whole!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 31: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Say, hast thou doom’d to this divided state
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 31: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or peaceful amity or stern debate?
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 31: Verse 7

						Declare thy purpose, for thy will is fate.”

						“Is not thy thought my own? (the god replies

						Who rolls the thunder o’er the vaulted skies;)

						Hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed

						The chief’s return should make the guilty bleed.

						’Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed.

				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses’ hand
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Has slain the suitors, Heaven shall bless the land.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						None now the kindred of the unjust shall own;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Forgot the slaughter’d brother and the son:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Each future day increase of wealth shall bring,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And o’er the past Oblivion stretch her wing.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest,

				-

				-
					-
						His people blessing, by his people bless’d.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 14
				-

						Let all be peace.”—He said, and gave the nod
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						That binds the Fates; the sanction of the god
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And prompt to execute the eternal will,

					Book 24: Stanza 32: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 33
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The rage of hunger and of thirst repress’d:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A son of Dolius on the message went,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The foe approach, embattled on the field.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With backward step he hastens to the bower,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And tells the news. They arm with all their power.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Four friends alone Ulysses’ cause embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And six were all the sons of Dolius’ race:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And brazen panoply invests the band.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The opening gates at once their war display:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That moment joins them with celestial aid,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In Mentor’s form, the Jove-descended maid:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The suffering hero felt his patient breast
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 33: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Swell with new joy, and thus his son address’d:
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 34
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight,)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The brave embattled, the grim front of fight!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The valiant with the valiant must contend.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Shame not the line whence glorious you descend.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Wide o’er the world their martial fame was spread;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 34: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Regard thyself, the living and the dead.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 35
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 35: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Thy eyes, great father! on this battle cast,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 35: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shall learn from me Penelope was chaste.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 36
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So spoke Telemachus: the gallant boy
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Good old Laertes heard with panting joy.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 3
				-
					-
						“And bless’d! thrice bless’d this happy day! (he cries,)
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A son and grandson of the Arcesian name
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 36: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Strive for fair virtue, and contest for fame!”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 37
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then thus Minerva in Laertes’ ear:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 2
				-
					-
						“Son of Arcesius, reverend warrior, hear!
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Jove and Jove’s daughter first implore in prayer,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then, whirling high, discharge thy lance in air.”
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 5
				-
					-
						She said, infusing courage with the word.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Jove and Jove’s daughter then the chief implored,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And, whirling high, dismiss’d the lance in air.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The brass-cheek’d helmet opens to the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Before the father and the conquering son
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The rebel race, and death had swallow’d all;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 15
				-
					-
						But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Her awful voice detain’d the headlong tide:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 17
				-
					-
						“Forbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 18
				-
					-
						From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare.”
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 20
				-
					-
						They drop their javelins, and their rage resign.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 21
				-
					-
						All scatter’d round their glittering weapons lie;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour’d along,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong.
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 25
				-
					-
						But Jove’s red arm the burning thunder aims:
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Before Minerva shot the livid flames;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 37: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then stopped the goddess, trembled and retired.
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 38
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 1
				-
					-
						“Descended from the gods! Ulysses, cease;
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 38: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace.”
					-
			-
				Book 24: Stanza 39
			-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The king obey’d. The virgin-seed of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In Mentor’s form, confirm’d the full accord,
					-
				-
					Book 24: Stanza 39: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And willing nations knew their lawful lord.
