				Book 1: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And in the doubtful war, before he won
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And settled sure succession in his line,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And the long glories of majestic Rome.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To persecute so brave, so just a man;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Or exercise their spite in human woe?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						An ancient town was seated on the sea;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A Tyrian colony; the people made
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The seat of awful empire she design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						That times to come should see the Trojan race
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Besides, long causes working in her mind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						For this, far distant from the Latian coast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Such length of labor for so vast a frame.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And plowing frothy furrows in the main;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						She, for the fault of one offending foe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						But I, who walk in awful state above,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						For length of years my fruitless force employ
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The restless regions of the storms she sought,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						This way and that th' impatient captives tend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Which did he not, their unresisted sway
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Would sweep the world before them in their way;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						In fear of this, the Father of the Gods
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To loose their fetters, or their force allay.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thy force alone their fury can restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To fruitful Italy their course they steer,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Around my person wait, and bear my train:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Succeed my wish, and second my design;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And make thee father of a happy line."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The work which duty binds me to fulfil.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						I sit with gods at their celestial feast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And roll the foaming billows to the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Then flashing fires the transient light renew;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The face of things a frightful image bears,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And present death in various forms appears.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						"That under Ilian walls before their parents died!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And lie by noble Hector on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						While those astern, descending down the steep,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And on the secret shelves with fury cast.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						From stem to stern by waves was overborne:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And here and there above the waves were seen
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Admit the deluge of the briny streams.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Of raging billows breaking on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						He rear'd his awful head above the main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Full well the god his sister's envy knew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And what her aims and what her arts pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And first an angry glance on both he cast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Is it for you to ravage seas and land,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						To raise such mountains on the troubled main?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						The realms of ocean and the fields of air
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						And boast and bluster in his empty hall."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						The god himself with ready trident stands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						His finny coursers and in triumph rides,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						If then some grave and pious man appear,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						He soothes with sober words their angry mood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						And quenches their innate desire of blood:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						So, when the Father of the Flood appears,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Within a long recess there lies a bay:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						An island shades it from the rolling sea,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						And forms a port secure for ships to ride;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Broke by the jutting land, on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						In double streams the briny waters glide.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Appears above, and groves for ever green:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Down thro' the crannies of the living walls
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						First, good Achates, with repeated strokes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						The dying sparkles in their fall receives:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						And takes a prospect of the seas below,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Three beamy stags command a lordly train
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 171
				-
					-
						He stood; and, while secure they fed below,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 172
				-
					-
						He took the quiver and the trusty bow
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 174
				-
					-
						He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 177
				-
					-
						For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 178
				-
					-
						And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 179
				-
					-
						The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 180
				-
					-
						When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 181
				-
					-
						He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 182
				-
					-
						In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 184
				-
					-
						With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 185
				-
					-
						"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 186
				-
					-
						To future good our past and present woes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 187
				-
					-
						With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 189
				-
					-
						What greater ills hereafter can you bear?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Resume your courage and dismiss your care,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 191
				-
					-
						An hour will come, with pleasure to relate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Thro' various hazards and events, we move
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 194
				-
					-
						To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Endure the hardships of your present state;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 198
				-
					-
						Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 199
				-
					-
						These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 200
				-
					-
						His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 201
				-
					-
						The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 202
				-
					-
						The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 204
				-
					-
						The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 2: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Disperses thunder on the seas and land,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Disposing all with absolute command;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						How could my pious son thy pow'r incense?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense?

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Our hope of Italy not only lost,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						On various seas by various tempests toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 22

				-
					-
						Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In after times should hold the world in awe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And to the land and ocean give the law.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-

						Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,

						When Fortune still pursues her former blow,

						What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 32

						What end of labors has your will decreed?

				-
					-
						Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts,

				-
					-
						Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves
					-
				-

						And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves.

					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						At length he founded Padua's happy seat,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;

				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 39

						There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name,

						But we, descended from your sacred line,

				-
					-
						Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine,

						Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one,

						Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne.

						Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?

						With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,

						Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 56
				-
					-
						No councils have revers'd my firm decree.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 60
				-
					-
						In Italy shall wage successful war,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 65
				-
					-
						This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 67
				-
					-
						He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 70
				-
					-
						The throne with his succession shall be fill'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 78
				-
					-
						The people Romans call, the city Rome.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 79
				-
					-
						To them no bounds of empire I assign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Nor term of years to their immortal line.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 83
				-
					-
						At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To cherish and advance the Trojan line.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 85
				-
					-
						The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 87
				-
					-
						An age is ripening in revolving fate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 88
				-
					-
						When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 90
				-
					-
						To crush the people that conspir'd her fall.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Securely shall repay with rites divine;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 96
				-
					-
						And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And the stern age be soften'd into peace:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Then banish'd Faith shall once again return,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 101
				-
					-
						And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 102
				-
					-
						The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Janus himself before his fane shall wait,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 104
				-
					-
						And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 105
				-
					-
						With bolts and iron bars: within remains
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 107
				-
					-
						High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 108
				-
					-
						He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 109
				-
					-
						He said, and sent Cyllenius with command
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 110
				-
					-
						To free the ports, and ope the Punic land
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 111
				-
					-
						To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 112
				-
					-
						The queen might force them from her town and state.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Performs his message, and displays his rod:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 117
				-
					-
						The surly murmurs of the people cease;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 118
				-
					-
						And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 119
				-
					-
						The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 123
				-
					-
						But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 124
				-
					-
						He rose, the coast and country to survey,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Anxious and eager to discover more.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 126
				-
					-
						It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 127
				-
					-
						But, whether humankind, or beasts alone
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 131
				-
					-
						The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 133
				-
					-
						And true Achates on his steps attends.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 136
				-
					-
						A huntress in her habit and her mien;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 141
				-
					-
						She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 142
				-
					-
						With such array Harpalyce bestrode
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 144
				-
					-
						"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 145
				-
					-
						"One of my sisters, like myself array'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 147
				-
					-
						A painted quiver at her back she bore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 149
				-
					-
						And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 151
				-
					-
						"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 152
				-
					-
						O virgin! or what other name you bear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Above that style- O more than mortal fair!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 155
				-
					-
						If, as you seem, the sister of the day,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 158
				-
					-
						But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 159
				-
					-
						What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 161
				-
					-
						And offer'd victims at your altars fall."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 162
				-
					-
						"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Of goddess, or celestial honors claim:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 164
				-
					-
						For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 165
				-
					-
						And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 167
				-
					-
						A people rude in peace, and rough in war.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 168
				-
					-
						The rising city, which from far you see,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 174
				-
					-
						For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 176
				-
					-
						At once was wounded with an equal dart.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 179
				-
					-
						One who condemn'd divine and human laws.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 181
				-
					-
						The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 182
				-
					-
						With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Before the sacred altar made him bleed,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 184
				-
					-
						And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 186
				-
					-
						To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 187
				-
					-
						At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 189
				-
					-
						And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 190
				-
					-
						The cruel altars and his fate he tells,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 191
				-
					-
						And the dire secret of his house reveals,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Then warns the widow, with her household gods,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 193
				-
					-
						To seek a refuge in remote abodes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Last, to support her in so long a way,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 195
				-
					-
						He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 197
				-
					-
						The queen provides companions of her flight:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 198
				-
					-
						They meet, and all combine to leave the state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 200
				-
					-
						They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 202
				-
					-
						The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 203
				-
					-
						With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 204
				-
					-
						I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 206
				-
					-
						At last they landed, where from far your eyes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 207
				-
					-
						May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 208
				-
					-
						There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 209
				-
					-
						From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 210
				-
					-
						But whence are you? what country claims your birth?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 211
				-
					-
						What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 212
				-
					-
						To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 213
				-
					-
						And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 214
				-
					-
						"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 215
				-
					-
						O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 216
				-
					-
						Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 217
				-
					-
						The day would sooner than the tale be done!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 218
				-
					-
						From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 219
				-
					-
						If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 220
				-
					-
						On various seas by various tempests toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 221
				-
					-
						At length we landed on your Libyan coast.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 222
				-
					-
						The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 223
				-
					-
						While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 224
				-
					-
						My household gods, companions of my woes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 225
				-
					-
						With pious care I rescued from our foes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 226
				-
					-
						To fruitful Italy my course was bent;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 227
				-
					-
						And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 228
				-
					-
						With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 229

					-
						Fate and my mother goddess led my way.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 230
				-
					-
						Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 231
				-
					-
						From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 234
				-
					-
						In Libyan desarts wander thus alone."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 235
				-
					-
						His tender parent could no longer bear;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 236
				-
					-
						But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 237
				-
					-
						"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 240
				-
					-
						And to the queen expose your just request.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Now take this earnest of success, for more:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 242
				-
					-
						Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 243
				-
					-
						The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 244
				-
					-
						Or I renounce my skill in augury.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 245
				-
					-
						Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 246
				-
					-
						And stoop with closing pinions from above;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 248
				-
					-
						And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 249
				-
					-
						Now, all united in a goodly team,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 250
				-
					-
						They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 251
				-
					-
						As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 252
				-
					-
						And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 253
				-
					-
						Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 254
				-
					-
						Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 255
				-
					-
						No more advice is needful; but pursue
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 256
				-
					-
						The path before you, and the town in view."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 258
				-
					-
						Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 259
				-
					-
						Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 260
				-
					-
						And widely spread ambrosial scents around:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 261
				-
					-
						In length of train descends her sweeping gown;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 262
				-
					-
						And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 263
				-
					-
						The prince pursued the parting deity
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 264
				-
					-
						With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 266
				-
					-
						In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 267
				-
					-
						Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 268
				-
					-
						And still to speak in accents not your own."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 269
				-
					-
						Against the goddess these complaints he made,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 270
				-
					-
						But took the path, and her commands obey'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 271
				-
					-
						They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 272
				-
					-
						With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 273
				-
					-
						That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 274
				-
					-
						Or force to tell the causes of their way.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 275
				-
					-
						This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 276
				-
					-
						To visit Paphos and her native clime;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 278
				-
					-
						With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 279
				-
					-
						A hundred altars in her temple smoke;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 280
				-
					-
						A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 281
				-
					-
						They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Now at a nearer distance view the town.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 283
				-
					-
						The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 284
				-
					-
						Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 285
				-
					-
						The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 286
				-
					-
						The noise and busy concourse of the mart.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 287
				-
					-
						The toiling Tyrians on each other call
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 288
				-
					-
						To ply their labor: some extend the wall;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 289
				-
					-
						Some build the citadel; the brawny throng
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 290
				-
					-
						Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 291
				-
					-
						Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 292
				-
					-
						Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 293
				-
					-
						Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 294
				-
					-
						Of holy senates, and elect by voice.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 295
				-
					-
						Here some design a mole, while others there
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 296
				-
					-
						Lay deep foundations for a theater;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 297
				-
					-
						From marble quarries mighty columns hew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 298
				-
					-
						For ornaments of scenes, and future view.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 299
				-
					-
						Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 300
				-
					-
						As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 301
				-
					-
						When winter past, and summer scarce begun,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 302
				-
					-
						Invites them forth to labor in the sun;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 303
				-
					-
						Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 304
				-
					-
						Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 305
				-
					-
						Some at the gate stand ready to receive
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 306
				-
					-
						The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 307
				-
					-
						All with united force, combine to drive
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 308
				-
					-
						The lazy drones from the laborious hive:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 309
				-
					-
						With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 310
				-
					-
						The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 311
				-
					-
						"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 312
				-
					-
						Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 313
				-
					-
						Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 314
				-
					-
						Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 315
				-
					-
						He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 316
				-
					-
						Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 317
				-
					-
						Full in the center of the town there stood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 318
				-
					-
						Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 319
				-
					-
						The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 320
				-
					-
						And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 321
				-
					-
						From under earth a courser's head they drew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 322
				-
					-
						Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 323
				-
					-
						This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 324
				-
					-
						Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 325
				-
					-
						Sidonian Dido here with solemn state
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 326
				-
					-
						Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 327
				-
					-
						Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 328
				-
					-
						But more the goddess made the place divine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 329
				-
					-
						On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 330
				-
					-
						And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 331
				-
					-
						The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 332
				-
					-
						The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 333
				-
					-
						What first Aeneas this place beheld,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 334
				-
					-
						Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 335
				-
					-
						For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 336
				-
					-
						His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 337
				-
					-
						Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 338
				-
					-
						The striving artists, and their arts' renown;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 339
				-
					-
						He saw, in order painted on the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 340
				-
					-
						Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 341
				-
					-
						The wars that fame around the world had blown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 342
				-
					-
						All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 343
				-
					-
						There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 344
				-
					-
						And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 345
				-
					-
						He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 346
				-
					-
						The monuments of Trojan woes appear!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 347
				-
					-
						Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 348
				-
					-
						See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 349
				-
					-
						Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 350
				-
					-
						And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 351
				-
					-
						He said (his tears a ready passage find),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 352
				-
					-
						Devouring what he saw so well design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 353
				-
					-
						And with an empty picture fed his mind:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 354
				-
					-
						For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 355
				-
					-
						And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 356
				-
					-
						Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 357
				-
					-
						On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 358
				-
					-
						The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 359
				-
					-
						By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 360
				-
					-
						And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 361
				-
					-
						The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 362
				-
					-
						Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 363
				-
					-
						Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 364
				-
					-
						Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 365
				-
					-
						Achilles, and unequal combat tried;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 366
				-
					-
						Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 367
				-
					-
						Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 368
				-
					-
						Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 369
				-
					-
						The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 370
				-
					-
						With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 371
				-
					-
						Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 372
				-
					-
						To Pallas' fane in long procession go,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 373
				-
					-
						In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 3: Verse 374
				-
					-
						They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The lifeless body of his son is sold.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So sad an object, and so well express'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To see the figure of his lifeless friend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And his old sire his helpless hand extend.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						When in the dance the graceful goddess leads
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Latona sees her shine above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Such Dido was; with such becoming state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Their labor to her future sway she speeds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						In crowds around, the swarming people join.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Their tasks in equal portions she divides,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And, where unequal, there by lots decides.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Another way by chance Aeneas bends
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And widely scatter'd on another coast.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Impatient till they told their present state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And where they left their ships, and what their fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And why they came, and what was their request;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						To sue for leave to land their sickly men,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And gain admission to the gracious queen.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						"O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						To found an empire in these new abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						To build a town, with statutes to restrain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And spare the remnant of a pious race!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						We come not with design of wasteful prey,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						To drive the country, force the swains away:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						To that sweet region was our voyage bent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						When winds and ev'ry warring element
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Shut up a desart shore to drowning men,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						And drive us to the cruel seas again?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						If our hard fortune no compassion draws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Observant of the right, religious of his word.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						That, if our prince be safe, we may renew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 108
				-
					-
						That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And if our young Iulus be no more,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 111
				-
					-
						That we to good Acestes may return,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And with our friends our common losses mourn."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 114
				-
					-
						With cries and clamors his request renew.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 115
				-
					-
						The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 117
				-
					-
						"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 118
				-
					-
						And doubts attending an unsettled state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Who has not heard the story of your woes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 121
				-
					-
						The name and fortune of your native place,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 122
				-
					-
						The fame and valor of the Phrygian race?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 123
				-
					-
						We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 127
				-
					-
						You seek the good Acestes' government,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 129
				-
					-
						And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 131
				-
					-
						To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 132
				-
					-
						My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 133
				-
					-
						And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 134
				-
					-
						On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 135
				-
					-
						My people shall, by my command, explore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 136
				-
					-
						The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 137
				-
					-
						And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 142
				-
					-
						"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 143
				-
					-
						What more can you desire, your welcome sure,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 145
				-
					-
						One only wants; and him we saw in vain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 148
				-
					-
						The rest agrees with what your mother said."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 150
				-
					-
						The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 151
				-
					-
						The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 152
				-
					-
						August in visage, and serenely bright.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 153
				-
					-
						His mother goddess, with her hands divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 4: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And thus with manly modesty he spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A prince that owes his life to you alone.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Fair majesty, the refuge and redress
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						You, who your pious offices employ
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						With hospitable rites relieve the poor;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Associate in your town a wand'ring train,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And strangers in your palace entertain:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						What thanks can wretched fugitives return,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In you this age is happy, and this earth,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And parents more than mortal gave you birth.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						While rolling rivers into seas shall run,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Your image shall be present in my mind."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Serestus with his left; then to his breast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And so by turns descended to the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Then recollected stood, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 47

						The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore

				-
					-
						To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 49

					-
						When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 51

						And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:

				-
					-
						My father Belus then with fire and sword
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.

						From him the Trojan siege I understood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Like you, an alien in a land unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						I learn to pity woes so like my own."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						She said, and to the palace led her guest;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						(The gold itself inferior to the cost),
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Of curious work, where on the sides were seen
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The fights and figures of illustrious men,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 81
				-
					-
						From their first founder to the present queen.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 82
				-
					-
						The good Aeneas, paternal care
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Iulus' absence could no longer bear,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 85
				-
					-
						To give a glad relation of the past,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 88
				-
					-
						A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 89
				-
					-
						An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 90
				-
					-
						From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 91
				-
					-
						With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Her mother Leda's present, when she came
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 93
				-
					-
						To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Of double texture, glorious to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 97
				-
					-
						One order set with gems, and one with gold.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 99
				-
					-
						And in his diligence his duty shows.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 100
				-
					-
						But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 101
				-
					-
						New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 102
				-
					-
						That Cupid should assume the shape and face
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 105
				-
					-
						And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 106
				-
					-
						For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 108
				-
					-
						These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 110
				-
					-
						"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 112
				-
					-
						To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 113
				-
					-
						And on thy succor and thy faith relies.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 115
				-
					-
						By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Him Dido now with blandishment detains;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 118
				-
					-
						But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 119
				-
					-
						For this 't is needful to prevent her art,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 120
				-
					-
						And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 121
				-
					-
						A love so violent, so strong, so sure,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 122
				-
					-
						As neither age can change, nor art can cure.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 123
				-
					-
						How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Ascanius by his father is design'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 125
				-
					-
						To come, with presents laden, from the port,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 126
				-
					-
						To gratify the queen, and gain the court.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 127
				-
					-
						I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 128
				-
					-
						And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 130
				-
					-
						May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 132
				-
					-
						But only for a night's revolving space:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 134
				-
					-
						That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 135
				-
					-
						The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 138
				-
					-
						The God of Love obeys, and sets aside
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 139
				-
					-
						His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 140
				-
					-
						He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 141
				-
					-
						And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 142
				-
					-
						The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 143
				-
					-
						And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 145
				-
					-
						She gently bears him to her blissful groves,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 147
				-
					-
						And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And brought the gifts. The queen already sate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 152
				-
					-
						High on a golden bed: her princely guest
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Was next her side; in order sate the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Th' attendants water for their hands supply,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 156
				-
					-
						And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Next fifty handmaids in long order bore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 158
				-
					-
						The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 160
				-
					-
						To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 161
				-
					-
						The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Approach, and on the painted couches rest.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 163
				-
					-
						All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 164
				-
					-
						But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 165
				-
					-
						His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 5: Verse 166
				-
					-
						His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;
					-
			-
				Book 1: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But, far above the rest, the royal dame,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The guileful god about the hero long,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With children's play, and false embraces, hung;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The dead is to the living love resign'd;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And all Aeneas enters in her mind.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						From gilded roofs depending lamps display
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						In lasting concord from this day combine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And gracious Juno, both be present here!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The goblet goes around: Iopas brought
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The various labors of the wand'ring moon,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Th' original of men and beasts; and whence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The summer nights and shortens winter days.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						To hear the series of the war desir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						"Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,
					-
				-

					-
						The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,

				-
					-
						Already some presag'd the dire event,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						For twice five days the good old seer withstood
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						But, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						All prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						On one alone, whose fury threaten'd all.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						The dismal day was come; the priests prepare
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Secure of safety when they sail'd away.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						But now what further hopes for me remain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						To see my friends, or native soil, again;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						My tender infants, or my careful sire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Whom they returning will to death require;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Will perpetrate on them their first design,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						If there be faith below, or gods above,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						If innocence and truth can claim desert,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						"False tears true pity move; the king commands
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 132

					-
						But truly tell, was it for force or guile,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						This well-invented tale for truth imparts:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						His hands now free, 'thou venerable sky!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Be all of you adjur'd; and grant I may,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						And justly punish whom I justly hate!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						If I, to save myself, your empire save.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Were only founded on Minerva's aid.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						But from the time when impious Diomede,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And false Ulysses, that inventive head,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Her fatal image from the temple drew,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Her virgin statue with their bloody hands
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Her alter'd mind and alienated care.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						When first her fatal image touch'd the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Then Calchas bade our host for flight
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And hope no conquest from the tedious war,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 2: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Till first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Her injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And now their navy plows the wat'ry main,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Yet soon expect it on your shores again,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						It pass, and intercept our better fates:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For so religion and the gods ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						That, if you violate with hands profane
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!)
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But if it climb, with your assisting hands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And the reverse of fate on us return.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						"With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done-
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						False tears and fawning words the city won.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						"A greater omen, and of worse portent,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Did our unwary minds with fear torment,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Concurring to produce the dire event.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Their flaming crests above the waves they show;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And now the strand, and now the plain they held;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 42
				-
					-
						We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And to Laocoon and his children make;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And first around the tender boys they wind,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 3: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The wretched father, running to their aid
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And twice about his gasping throat they fold.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With both his hands he labors at the knots;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His holy fillets the blue venom blots;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His roaring fills the flitting air around.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						By her large buckler and protended spear.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And dared to violate the sacred wood.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And incense offer'd to th' offended maid.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Each on his fellow for assistance calls;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						O sacred city, built by hands divine!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						We haul along the horse in solemn state;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then place the dire portent within the tow'r.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Safe under covert of the silent night,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And guided by th' imperial galley's light;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Who joyful from their long confinement rose.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Nor was the Podalirian hero last,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 64

						Those few they find awake first meet their fate;

						Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.

						"'T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs

				-
					-
						When Hector's ghost before my sight appears:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						A bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-

						Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore;

				-

				-
					-
						And all the wounds he for his country bore

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						I wept to see the visionary man,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And, while my trance continued, thus began:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,

					-
						Art thou so late return'd for our defense?

						Do we behold thee, wearied as we are
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						With length of labors, and with toils of war?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						After so many fun'rals of thy own
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Art thou restor'd to thy declining town?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 92

					-
						But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace

						Deforms the manly features of thy face?'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 94

					-
						"To this the specter no reply did frame,

				-
					-
						And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 97

					-
						This warning in these mournful words express'd:

					-
						Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						More than enough to duty and to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						If by a mortal hand my father's throne
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-

						Could be defended, 't was by mine alone.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Now Troy to thee commends her future state,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And gives her gods companions of thy fate:

					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 110
				-

						He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The venerable statues of the gods,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 112

					-
						With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 113
				-
					-
						The wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 114
				-
					-
						"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:

				-
					-
						Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 4: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.

						Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,

						Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,

						For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 105
				-
					-
						But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Then change we shields, and their devices bear:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Let fraud supply the want of force in war.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 108
				-
					-
						They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 109
				-
					-
						In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 110
				-
					-
						His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 119
				-
					-
						And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 121
				-
					-
						"But, ah! what use of valor can be made,

						When heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid!

						Behold the royal prophetess, the fair

						Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,

				-
					-
						Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 126
				-
					-
						In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 127

						On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried-

						'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied.

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 130
				-
					-
						But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew:

				-
					-
						Our leader's rash example we pursue.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 133
				-
					-
						But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 134

					-
						Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:

					-
						We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow,

					-
						Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show.

				-
					-
						They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;

					-
						And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie.

						The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite,

						The brother kings with Ajax join their force,

						South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;

				-
					-
						The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,

						At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd.

				-
					-
						No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 166

					-
						Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life;

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 168

						I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought.

				-
					-
						Borne off to distance by the growing tide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 172
				-
					-
						With Pelias wounded, and without defense.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 173
				-
					-
						New clamors from th' invested palace ring:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 174

					-
						We run to die, or disengage the king.

						While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 177
				-
					-
						As all the Dardan and Argolic race

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 178

					-
						Had been contracted in that narrow space;

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 179
				-
					-
						Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,

					-
						Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,

				-
					-
						Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 183

					-
						Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,

				-
					-
						Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;

				-

				-
					-
						From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;

				-
					-
						And heavy beams and rafters from the sides
					-
				-

				-
					-
						(Such arms their last necessity provides)

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 191
				-
					-
						And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 192

						The marks of state and ancient royalty.

						The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.

						Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,

						A second time we ran to tempt our death,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 197
				-
					-
						To clear the palace from the foe, succeed
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 198

						The weary living, and revenge the dead.

						"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free,

					-
						The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 209

						Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 210
				-

						Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew;

				-
					-
						And, where the rafters on the columns meet,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 212

					-
						We push them headlong with our arms and feet.

						The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,

						Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath

					-
						With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 223
				-
					-
						And, casting off his slough when spring returns,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;

					-
						Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 226
				-
					-
						Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 227
				-
					-
						High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 228

						And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;

				-
					-
						And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 236
				-
					-
						And with his ax repeated strokes bestows

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 237

						The halls of audience, and of public state,

					-
						And where the lonely queen in secret sate.

						Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,

						The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries,

					-
						And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;

						The fearful matrons run from place to place,

						The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,

					-
						Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:

				-
					-
						Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 260
				-
					-
						And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.

						The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,

				-
					-
						So large a promise, of a progeny),

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 267
				-
					-
						The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 269
				-
					-
						Where'er the raging fire had left a space,

					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 278
				-
					-
						Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 281
				-
					-
						An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 283
				-
					-
						The household gods, and shade the holy ground.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 284
				-
					-
						Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 286
				-
					-
						Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 287
				-
					-
						Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 288
				-
					-
						The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 289
				-
					-
						And hanging by his side a heavy sword,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 290
				-
					-
						'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 291
				-
					-
						What arms are these, and to what use design'd?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 292
				-
					-
						These times want other aids! Were Hector here,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 293
				-
					-
						Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 294
				-
					-
						With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 295
				-
					-
						Or in one common fate with us be join'd.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 296
				-
					-
						She said, and with a last salute embrac'd
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 297
				-
					-
						The poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 298
				-
					-
						Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 299
				-
					-
						Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 300
				-
					-
						Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 301
				-
					-
						Thro' empty courts and open galleries.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 302
				-
					-
						Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 303
				-
					-
						And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 304
				-
					-
						The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 305
				-
					-
						Expires before his wretched parent's eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 307
				-
					-
						The fear of death gave place to nature's law;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 308
				-
					-
						And, shaking more with anger than with age,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 309
				-
					-
						'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 310
				-
					-
						As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 311
				-
					-
						If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just-
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 312
				-
					-
						Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 313
				-
					-
						With a son's death t' infect a father's sight.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 314
				-
					-
						Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 315
				-
					-
						To call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 316
				-
					-
						Thus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 317
				-
					-
						The laws of nature and of nations heard.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 318
				-
					-
						He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 319
				-
					-
						The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 320
				-
					-
						Pitied the woes a parent underwent,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 321
				-
					-
						And sent me back in safety from his tent.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 322
				-
					-
						"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 323
				-
					-
						Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 324
				-
					-
						Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 325
				-
					-
						And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 326
				-
					-
						"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 327
				-
					-
						And to my father my foul deeds relate.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 328
				-
					-
						Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 329
				-
					-
						Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 330
				-
					-
						(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 331
				-
					-
						Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 332
				-
					-
						And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 333
				-
					-
						His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 334
				-
					-
						His left he twisted in his hoary hair;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 335
				-
					-
						Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 336
				-
					-
						The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 337
				-
					-
						And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 338
				-
					-
						Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 339
				-
					-
						With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 340
				-
					-
						He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 341
				-
					-
						Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 342
				-
					-
						On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 343
				-
					-
						A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 344
				-
					-
						"Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 345
				-
					-
						Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 346
				-
					-
						My father's image fill'd my pious mind,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 347
				-
					-
						Lest equal years might equal fortune find.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 348
				-
					-
						Again I thought on my forsaken wife,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 349
				-
					-
						And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 350
				-
					-
						I look'd about, but found myself alone,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 351
				-
					-
						Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 352
				-
					-
						Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 5: Verse 353
				-
					-
						Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The graceless Helen in the porch I spied
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In state attended with a captive crew,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						My mother stood reveal'd before my sight
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Never so radiant did her eyes appear;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Great in her charms, as when on gods above
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						She looks, and breathes herself into their love.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Then from her rosy lips began to speak:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Of my commands, and those whom I protect?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Look if your helpless father yet survive,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Around your house the greedy Grecians err;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And these had perish'd in the nightly war,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						But for my presence and protecting care.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						But by the gods was this destruction brought.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The shape of each avenging deity.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And heaves the building from the solid base.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And arms against the town the partial deities.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'
					-
			-
				Book 2: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And Ilium from its old foundations rent;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						About the roots the cruel ax resounds;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The war is felt on high; the nodding crown
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To their united force it yields, tho' late,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The roots no more their upper load sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire:

						Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.

						At least the pitying foes will aid my death,

					-
						To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:
					-
				-

						As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care.

						Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 75
				-
					-
						While th' other hand sustains my weighty shield,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 76

						And cross the threshold in my passage lay,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 81

					-
						'If death be your design, at least,' said she,

					-
						'Take us along to share your destiny.

						If any farther hopes in arms remain,

				-

						This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.

					-
						Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'

					-
						While thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 89

					-
						For, while I held my son, in the short space
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 92
				-
					-
						A lambent flame arose, which gently spread
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Around his brows, and on his temples fed.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Amaz'd, with running water we prepare
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 95
				-
					-
						To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 96
				-
					-
						But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 97
				-
					-
						His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 98
				-
					-
						'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 7: Verse 99

					-
						Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,

						Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'

					-
						Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						From o'er the roof the blaze began to move,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						"The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The gods' protection, and their star ador'd.

						'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay!

					-
						This tender child! These omens are your own,

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And you can yet restore the ruin'd town.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 18

					-
						I stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.'

						"He said. The crackling flames appear on high.

					-
						And driving sparkles dance along the sky.

				-
					-
						With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,

						'Haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,)

						One death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.

					-
						My hand shall lead our little son; and you,

						My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.

						Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:

				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Shoots up her venerable head on high,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						By long religion kept; there bend your feet,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And in divided parties let us meet.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						In me 't is impious holy things to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 42
				-
					-
						I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The welcome load of my dear father take;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 45
				-
					-
						While on my better hand Ascanius hung,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And with unequal paces tripp'd along.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 49
				-
					-
						I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 51
				-
					-
						At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Secure, and deeming all the danger past,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 55
				-
					-
						A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 56
				-
					-
						My father, looking thro' the shades, with fear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Their swords and shining armor I descry.'
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Some hostile god, for some unknown offense,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 61
				-
					-
						For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 64
				-
					-
						If by her fatal destiny she fell,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Or weary sate, or wander'd with affright;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 66
				-
					-
						But she was lost for ever to my sight.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 67
				-
					-
						I knew not, or reflected, till I meet
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 68
				-
					-
						My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 69
				-
					-
						We met: not one was wanting; only she
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 71
				-
					-
						"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 73
				-
					-
						This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Abandoning my now forgotten care,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 78
				-
					-
						My sire, my son, my country gods I left.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 79
				-
					-
						In shining armor once again I sheathe
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 80
				-
					-
						My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Then headlong to the burning walls I run,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 83
				-
					-
						I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 85
				-
					-
						All things were full of horror and affright,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Then to my father's house I make repair,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 88
				-
					-
						With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 90
				-
					-
						The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 93
				-
					-
						From thence to Priam's palace I resort,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And search the citadel and desart court.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 96
				-
					-
						A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 97
				-
					-
						There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 99
				-
					-
						The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And golden bowls from burning altars caught,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 101
				-
					-
						The tables of the gods, the purple vests,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 102
				-
					-
						The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 103
				-
					-
						A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 104
				-
					-
						And captive matrons, in long order stands.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Creusa still I call; at length she hears,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And sudden thro' the shades of night appears-
					-
				-
					Book 2: Stanza 8: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						"All are concern'd to know what place the god

						Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear

						Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.

						The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 143
				-
					-
						In the mid ocean lies, with large command,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 144
				-
					-
						And on its plains a hundred cities stand.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Another Ida rises there, and we
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						From thence, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;
					-

					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						In humble vales they built their soft abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						She secret rites and ceremonies taught,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And to the yoke the savage lions brought.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-

						If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,

						The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.'

						Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Another bull to bright Apollo slew;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						From foreign or domestic enemy.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 170

						The shouts of sailors double near the shores;

					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 182
				-
					-
						With eager haste a rising town I frame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 184
				-
					-
						The name itself was grateful; I exhort
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 185
				-
					-
						To found their houses, and erect a fort.

						The youth begin to till the labor'd land;

				-
					-
						Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 1: Verse 199
				-
					-
						To learn what end of woes we might expect,

				-
					-
						And with the hellish nation wage the war.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						They, as commanded, for the fight provide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Then, when along the crooked shore we hear
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						In this new kind of combat all employ
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						In vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						At length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Yet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And thus her dismal errand did relate:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						'What! not contented with our oxen slain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And drive the Harpies from their native reign?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate-
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Th' Italian shores are granted you to find,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And a safe passage to the port assign'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						My curses shall severely be fulfill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						And on th' offended Harpies humbly call,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And whether gods or birds obscene they were,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						'These omens; render vain this prophecy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And from th' impending curse a pious people free!'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						"Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And next by rocky Neritos we steer:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						We fly from Ithaca's detested shore,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						At length Leucate's cloudy top appears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And joyful to the little city haste.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The customs of our country we pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And left so many Grecian towns behind.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						And Boreas on the seas display'd his force:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The verse beneath my name and action speaks:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						"Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						I leave my galleys riding in the port,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						And long to see the new Dardanian court.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						And sacred priests in order stand around,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						The grove itself resembles Ida's wood;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						But when at nearer distance she beheld
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						My shining armor and my Trojan shield,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						"'Are you alive, O goddess-born ?' she said,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						With broken words I made this brief reply:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						'All of me that remains appears in sight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						I live, if living be to loathe the light.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						My fate resembling that of Hector's wife.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						By what strange blessing are you now restor'd?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						After a modest pause she thus begun:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						"'O only happy maid of Priam's race,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Or in a haughty master's arms to lie.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Thus I submitted to the lawless pride
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						And longing to redeem the promis'd fair,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						At least one half with Helenus remain'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 169
				-
					-
						And names from Pergamus his rising walls.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 170
				-
					-
						But you, what fates have landed on our coast?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 171
				-
					-
						What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 174
				-
					-
						O tell me how his mother's loss he bears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 175
				-
					-
						What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 176
				-
					-
						How much of Hector in his face appears?'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 177
				-
					-
						She spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 178
				-
					-
						And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 179
				-
					-
						"At length her lord descends upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 180
				-
					-
						In pomp, attended with a num'rous train;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Receives his friends, and to the city leads,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 182
				-
					-
						And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Proceeding on, another Troy I see,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 185
				-
					-
						A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 186
				-
					-
						And I embrace the Scaean gate again.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 187
				-
					-
						My friends in porticoes were entertain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 188
				-
					-
						And feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 189
				-
					-
						The tables fill'd the spacious hall around,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 190
				-
					-
						And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Blown from the supplied our swelling sails.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 193
				-

						Then to the royal seer I thus began:

					-
						'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man,

				-
					-
						The laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree;
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 197

					-
						From his own tripod, and his holy tree;

				-
					-
						Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 199
				-
					-
						What auspices their notes and flights declare:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 200
				-
					-
						O say- for all religious rites portend
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 201
				-
					-
						A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 202
				-
					-
						And ev'ry power and omen of the sky
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Direct my course for destin'd Italy;

					-
						A dismal famine fatally forebodes-

					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 206
				-
					-
						O say what dangers I am first to shun,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 207
				-
					-
						What toils vanquish, and what course to run.'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 208
				-
					-
						"The prophet first with sacrifice adores

						First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,

						Will far from your deluded wishes fly;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 226
				-
					-
						Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 227
				-
					-
						For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 228
				-
					-
						And stem the currents with your struggling oars;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 229
				-
					-
						Then round th' Italian coast your navy steer;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 230
				-
					-
						And, after this, to Circe's island veer;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 231
				-
					-
						And, last, before your new foundations rise,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.

					-
						Which fronts from far th' Epirian continent:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 246

						Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd;

						And priests with holy vows the gods adore,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 2: Verse 254
				-

						Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,

						The shortest passage to th' Italian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						We land, and, on the bosom Of the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Their watches, and the rest securely sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The night, proceeding on with silent pace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Her steepy rise and her declining race.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And both the Bears is careful to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						But a sure promise of a settled sky,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						"And now the rising morn with rosy light
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						When we from far, like bluish mists, descry
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Then, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And you who raging winds and waves appease,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The gentle gales their flagging force renew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And now the happy harbor is in view.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The curling waters round the galleys roar.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The land lies open to the raging east,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The port lies hid within; on either side
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						The temple, which aloft we view'd before,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Whose temple was the landmark of our way.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And all commands of Helenus obey'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						To sea, forsaking that suspected land.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						For Hercules renown'd, if fame be true.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 89

						Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Caulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Far off we hear the waves with surly sound
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The billows break upon the sounding strand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Then thus Anchises, in experience old:

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						''T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						With haste the frighted mariners obey.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Then down to hell descend, when they divide;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.

						The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;

						And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.

						The port capacious, and secure from wind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 4

					-
						Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd.
					-
				-

						By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;

				-
					-
						By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.
					-
				-

						Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,

						This flaming hill, and on his body threw.

				-
					-
						As often as he turns his weary sides,

						He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.

						In shady woods we pass the tedious night,

						Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,

					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 21

						For not one star was kindled in the sky,

				-
					-
						Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply;

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 24

				-
					-
						"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd,

						When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 5: Verse 28

					-
						Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,

						So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,

					-
						Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 3

						Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began
					-

					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 7

					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						A hundred more this hated island bears:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And in deserted caverns lodge by night;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						While all around my longing eyes I cast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						I saw your happy ships appear at last.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						What other death you please, yourselves bestow.'
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						"Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						We saw the giant shepherd stalk before
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His following flock, and leading to the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His pond'rous whistle from his neck descends;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						His woolly care their pensive lord attends:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						This only solace his hard fortune sends.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides,
					-
			-
				Book 3: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The cables cut, and silent haste away;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The well-deserving stranger entertain;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The giant harken'd to the dashing sound:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But, when our vessels out of reach he found,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He strided onward, and in vain essay'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The neigh'ring Aetna trembling all around,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The winding caverns echo to the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A dreadful council, with their heads on high;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Not yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And take th' advantage of the friendly gale.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						An equal fate on either side appears:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						This passage Achaemenides had shown,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Tracing the course which he before had run.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						There lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						From Greece a secret passage under ground,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						By love to beauteous Arethusa led;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 42
				-
					-
						As Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore

				-
					-
						Diana's name, protectress of the shore.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 44

					-
						With prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds

					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 46

						Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The rocky shore extended to the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The town of Camarine from far we see,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 50
				-
					-
						In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 54
				-
					-
						We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 57

						At length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd,

						Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd.

				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Here, after endless labors, often toss'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 60
				-
					-
						By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 61
				-
					-
						My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The prophet, who my future woes reveal'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 68
				-
					-
						This my last labor was. Some friendly god
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 69
				-
					-
						From thence convey'd us to your blest abode."
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 71
				-
					-
						His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Stanza 8: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And here concluding, he retir'd to rest.

			Book 4
		-

				Book 4: Stanza 1
			-

				-
					-
						But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						She fed within her veins a flame unseen;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Improve the passion, and increase the smart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 7

						Now, when the purple morn had chas'd away

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Her sister first with early care she sought,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						My lab'ring soul! what visions of the night
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His worth, his actions, and majestic air,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A man descended from the gods declare.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Fear ever argues a degenerate kind;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His birth is well asserted by his mind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						What brave attempts for falling Troy he made!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Of hapless marriage, never to be curst
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						With second love, so fatal was my first,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To this one error I might yield again;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This only man is able to subvert
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And, to confess my frailty, to my shame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Somewhat I find within, if not the same,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Too like the sparkles of my former flame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						But first let yawning earth a passage rend,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And let me thro' the dark abyss descend;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						First let avenging Jove, with flames from high,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Drive down this body to the nether sky,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Before I break the plighted faith I gave!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						No! he who had my vows shall ever have;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						For, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						"O dearer than the vital air I breathe,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-

						Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Without the joys of mother or of wife?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 46

					-
						Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Are known or valued by the ghosts below?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						It well became a woman, and a queen,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 53

						But will you fight against a pleasing flame!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						This little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Gaetulian cities here are spread around,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						This wand'ring navy to your needful aid:

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						How will your empire spread, your city rise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						From such a union, and with such allies?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Implore the favor of the pow'rs above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And leave the conduct of the rest to love.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Continue still your hospitable way,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And still invent occasions of their stay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet."

					-
						These words, which from a friend and sister came,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And added fury to the kindled flame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Inspir'd with hope, the project they pursue;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						A chosen ewe of two years old they pay
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Preferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The beauteous queen before her altar stands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And holds the golden goblet in her hands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						With hourly care the sacrifice renews,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						And anxiously the panting entrails views.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						From street to street the raving Dido roves.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						And now she leads the Trojan chief along
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Which love, without his labor, makes his own.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						When day declines, and feasts renew the night,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						She longs again to hear the prince relate
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						His own adventures and the Trojan fate.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						For still she begs to hear it once again.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And thus the tragic story never ends.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Absent, her absent hero sees and hears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And seeks the father's image in the child,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						If love by likeness might be so beguil'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						No labors exercise the youthful band,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky,
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But when imperial Juno, from above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With soothing words to Venus she begun:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						"High praises, endless honors, you have won,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Two gods a silly woman have undone!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This rising city, which my hands erect:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But shall celestial discord never cease?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						'T is better ended in a lasting peace.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						One common kingdom, one united line.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Which would the scepter of the world misguide
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And such alliance and such gifts refuse,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						If Fortune with our joint desires comply?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Lest he forbid, with absolute command,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To mix the people in one common land-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						In lasting leagues and sure succession join?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						But you, the partner of his bed and throne,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						May move his mind; my wishes are your own."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						"Mine," said imperial Juno, "be the care;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Time urges, now, to perfect this affair:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Attend my counsel, and the secret share.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						When next the Sun his rising light displays,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And gilds the world below with purple rays,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And cheerful horns from side to side resound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						One cave a grateful shelter shall afford
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						I will myself the bridal bed prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And Hymen shall be present at the rites."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						At her vain project, and discover'd wiles.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The rosy morn was risen from the main,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And horns and hounds awake the princely train:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						They issue early thro' the city gate,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The Tyrian peers and officers of state
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						For the slow queen in antechambers wait;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Her lofty courser, in the court below,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Who his majestic rider seems to know,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						The queen at length appears; on either hand
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The brawny guards in martial order stand.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And at her back a golden quiver bore;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						But far above the rest in beauty shines
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						When to his native Delos he resorts,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Before the joyful altars join their hands:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The merry madness of the sacred show.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						A golden fillet binds his awful brows;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						In manly presence, or in lofty mien.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And a long chase in open view maintain.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Impatiently he views the feeble prey,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						And rather would the tusky boar attend,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Or see the tawny lion downward bend.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The company, dispers'd, to converts ride,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The rapid rains, descending from the hills,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						One common cavern in her bosom hides.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Hell from below, and Juno from above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						The queen, whom sense of honor could not move,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						No longer made a secret of her love,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						But call'd it marriage, by that specious name
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 123

					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						She fills the peaceful universe with cries;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With court informers haunts, and royal spies;

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 3: Verse 6

						Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with

						lies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Talk is her business, and her chief delight
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To tell of prodigies and cause affright.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						She fills the people's ears with Dido's name,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Admits into her throne and nuptial bed
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Whole days with him she passes in delights,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And wastes in luxury long winter nights,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The goddess widely spreads the loud report,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And flies at length to King Hyarba's court.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						When first possess'd with this unwelcome news
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						He, when he heard a fugitive could move
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Mad with despair, impatient with desire;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						A wand'ring woman builds, within our state,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						A little town, bought at an easy rate;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						She pays me homage, and my grants allow
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And now this other Paris, with his train
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And I, rejected I, adore an empty name."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And both forgetful of their better fame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						By whom his menacing command he sends:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						In slothful not and inglorious ease,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						To him this message from my mouth relate:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Hers was a hero, destin'd to command
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						A martial race, and rule the Latian land,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						If glory cannot move a mind so mean,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And grudge the Romans their immortal name!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						What are his vain designs! what hopes he more
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Regardless to redeem his honor lost,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						With rapid force they bear him down the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						But first he grasps within his awful hand
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The founts of rolling streams their race begin;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						A beard of ice on his large breast depends.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And near the surface of the water flies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 109
				-
					-
						He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 113
				-
					-
						New ramparts raising for the town's defense.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 114
				-
					-
						A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 115
				-
					-
						(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 116
				-
					-
						A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 117
				-
					-
						For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Then thus, with winged words, the god began,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 121
				-
					-
						These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Who sways the world below and heav'n above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Has sent me down with this severe command:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 125
				-
					-
						What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 126
				-
					-
						If glory cannot move a mind so mean,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 130
				-
					-
						To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 132
				-
					-
						So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 134
				-
					-
						The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Revolving in his mind the stern command,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 137
				-
					-
						He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 138
				-
					-
						What should he say? or how should he begin?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 139
				-
					-
						What course, alas! remains to steer between
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 141
				-
					-
						This way and that he turns his anxious mind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And all expedients tries, and none can find.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 144
				-
					-
						After long thought, to this advice he leans:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 146
				-
					-
						The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Some plausible pretense he bids them find,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 148
				-
					-
						To color what in secret he design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Before the love-sick lady heard the news;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 151
				-
					-
						And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 152
				-
					-
						To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 154
				-
					-
						They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 155
				-
					-
						But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 156
				-
					-
						(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)

				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 157
				-
					-
						She was the first to find the secret fraud,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Love the first motions of the lover hears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Nor impious Fame was wanting to report
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 162
				-
					-
						The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 163
				-
					-
						And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 165
				-
					-
						And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 167
				-
					-
						When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 169
				-
					-
						At length she finds the dear perfidious man;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 171
				-
					-
						"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 172
				-
					-
						And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Nor could my kindness your compassion move.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Or is the death of a despairing queen
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 178
				-
					-
						You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 179
				-
					-
						False as you are, suppose you were not bound
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 180
				-
					-
						To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 183
				-
					-
						See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 185
				-
					-
						By this right hand, (since I have nothing more
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 186
				-
					-
						To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 187
				-
					-
						I beg you by these tears too truly shed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 188
				-
					-
						By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 189
				-
					-
						If ever Dido, when you most were kind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 191
				-
					-
						By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Pity the fortunes of a falling race.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 193
				-
					-
						For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 195
				-
					-
						For you alone I suffer in my fame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 198
				-
					-
						(That only name remains of all the rest!)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 199
				-
					-
						What have I left? or whither can I fly?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 202
				-
					-
						A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 204
				-
					-
						And left behind some pledge of our delight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Whose features might express his father's face;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 208
				-
					-
						I should not then complain to live bereft
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Of all my husband, or be wholly left."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 211
				-
					-
						By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 213
				-
					-
						"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Your boundless favors, or I own my debt;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 216
				-
					-
						While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 217
				-
					-
						This only let me speak in my defense:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 218
				-
					-
						I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Much less pretended to the lawful claim
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 221
				-
					-
						For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 222
				-
					-
						And not submit my life to fate's decree,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 223
				-
					-
						My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Those relics to review, their dust adore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 225
				-
					-
						And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 226
				-
					-
						But now the Delphian oracle commands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 227
				-
					-
						And fate invites me to the Latian lands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 228
				-
					-
						That is the promis'd place to which I steer,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 229
				-
					-
						And all my vows are terminated there.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 230
				-
					-
						If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 231
				-
					-
						With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Why may not we- like you, a foreign race-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 234
				-
					-
						As often as the night obscures the skies
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 235
				-
					-
						With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 236
				-
					-
						Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 238
				-
					-
						And young Ascanius justly may complain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 240
				-
					-
						Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Waking I saw him, and his message heard.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 242
				-
					-
						From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 243
				-
					-
						With radiant beams, and manifest to sight
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 244
				-
					-
						(The sender and the sent I both attest)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 245
				-
					-
						These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 246
				-
					-
						Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 248
				-
					-
						Thus while he spoke, already she began,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 249
				-
					-
						With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 250
				-
					-
						From head to foot survey'd his person o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 251
				-
					-
						Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 252
				-
					-
						"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 253
				-
					-
						Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 254
				-
					-
						But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 255
				-
					-
						And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 256
				-
					-
						Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 258
				-
					-
						Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 259
				-
					-
						All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 260
				-
					-
						So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 261
				-
					-
						Of man's injustice why should I complain?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 262
				-
					-
						The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 263
				-
					-
						Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 264
				-
					-
						Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 266
				-
					-
						Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 267
				-
					-
						I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 268
				-
					-
						With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 269
				-
					-
						I took the traitor to my throne and bed:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 270
				-
					-
						Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 271
				-
					-
						The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 272
				-
					-
						I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 273
				-
					-
						And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 274
				-
					-
						Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 275
				-
					-
						Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 276
				-
					-
						To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 278
				-
					-
						But go! thy flight no longer I detain-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 281
				-
					-
						The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 283
				-
					-
						To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 284
				-
					-
						Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 286
				-
					-
						When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 287
				-
					-
						Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 288
				-
					-
						Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 289
				-
					-
						Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 290
				-
					-
						At least my shade thy punishment shall know,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 291
				-
					-
						And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 292
				-
					-
						Abruptly here she stops; then turns away
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 293
				-
					-
						Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 294
				-
					-
						Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 295
				-
					-
						What speech to frame, and what excuse to find.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 296
				-
					-
						Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 297
				-
					-
						And softly laid her on her ivory bed.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 298
				-
					-
						But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 299
				-
					-
						To give that pity which her grief requir'd;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 300
				-
					-
						Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 301
				-
					-
						Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 302
				-
					-
						Reviews his forces: they with early care
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 303
				-
					-
						Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 304
				-
					-
						The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 305
				-
					-
						And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 307
				-
					-
						Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 308
				-
					-
						Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 309
				-
					-
						With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 310
				-
					-
						On ev'ry side are seen, descending down,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 311
				-
					-
						Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 312
				-
					-
						Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 313
				-
					-
						Fearful of winter, and of future wants,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 314
				-
					-
						T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 315
				-
					-
						The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 316
				-
					-
						The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 317
				-
					-
						Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 318
				-
					-
						Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 319
				-
					-
						Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 320
				-
					-
						All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 321
				-
					-
						What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 322
				-
					-
						When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 323
				-
					-
						And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 324
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 325
				-
					-
						All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 326
				-
					-
						In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 327
				-
					-
						Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 328
				-
					-
						To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 329
				-
					-
						No female arts or aids she left untried,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 330
				-
					-
						Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 331
				-
					-
						"Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 332
				-
					-
						They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 333
				-
					-
						The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 334
				-
					-
						Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 335
				-
					-
						Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 336
				-
					-
						My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 337
				-
					-
						But do not you my last request deny;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 338
				-
					-
						With yon perfidious man your int'rest try,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 339
				-
					-
						And bring me news, if I must live or die.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 340
				-
					-
						You are his fav'rite; you alone can find
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 341
				-
					-
						The dark recesses of his inmost mind:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 342
				-
					-
						In all his trusted secrets you have part,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 343
				-
					-
						And know the soft approaches to his heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 344
				-
					-
						Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 345
				-
					-
						Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 346
				-
					-
						Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 347
				-
					-
						Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 348
				-
					-
						Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 349
				-
					-
						Why should he then reject a just!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 350
				-
					-
						Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 351
				-
					-
						Can he this last, this only pray'r deny!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 352
				-
					-
						Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 353
				-
					-
						Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 354
				-
					-
						The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 355
				-
					-
						Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 356
				-
					-
						A short delay is all I ask him now;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 357
				-
					-
						A pause of grief, an interval from woe,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 358
				-
					-
						Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 359
				-
					-
						Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 360
				-
					-
						If you in pity grant this one request,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 361
				-
					-
						My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 362
				-
					-
						This mournful message pious Anna bears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 363
				-
					-
						And seconds with her own her sister's tears:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 364
				-
					-
						But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 365
				-
					-
						Again she comes, and is refus'd again.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 366
				-
					-
						His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 367
				-
					-
						Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 368
				-
					-
						As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 369
				-
					-
						Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 370
				-
					-
						This way and that the mountain oak they bend,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 371
				-
					-
						His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 372
				-
					-
						With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 373
				-
					-
						The hollow valleys echo to the sound:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 374
				-
					-
						Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 375
				-
					-
						Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 376
				-
					-
						Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 377
				-
					-
						So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 378
				-
					-
						No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 379
				-
					-
						Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 380
				-
					-
						And bandied words, still beating on his ears.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 381
				-
					-
						Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 382
				-
					-
						But the firm purpose of his heart remains.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 383
				-
					-
						The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 384
				-
					-
						Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 385
				-
					-
						And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 386
				-
					-
						To hasten on the death her soul decrees:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 387
				-
					-
						Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 388
				-
					-
						She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 389
				-
					-
						The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 390
				-
					-
						And the white offer'd milk converts to mud.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 391
				-
					-
						This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 392
				-
					-
						From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 393
				-
					-
						A marble temple stood within the grove,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 394
				-
					-
						Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 395
				-
					-
						That honor'd chapel she had hung around
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 396
				-
					-
						With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 397
				-
					-
						Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 398
				-
					-
						Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 399
				-
					-
						She thought she heard him summon her away,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 400
				-
					-
						Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 401
				-
					-
						Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 402
				-
					-
						The solitary screech owl strains her throat,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 403
				-
					-
						And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 404
				-
					-
						With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 405
				-
					-
						Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 406
				-
					-
						And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 407
				-
					-
						Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 408
				-
					-
						To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 409
				-
					-
						Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 410
				-
					-
						To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 411
				-
					-
						Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 412
				-
					-
						He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 413
				-
					-
						Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 414
				-
					-
						Full in his face infernal torches toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 415
				-
					-
						And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 416
				-
					-
						Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 417
				-
					-
						The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 418
				-
					-
						Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 419
				-
					-
						From death alone she seeks her last relief;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 420
				-
					-
						The time and means resolv'd within her breast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 421
				-
					-
						She to her mournful sister thus address'd
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 422
				-
					-
						(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 423
				-
					-
						And a false vigor in her eyes appears):
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 424
				-
					-
						"Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 425
				-
					-
						My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 426
				-
					-
						Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 427
				-
					-
						Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 428
				-
					-
						There a Massylian priestess I have found,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 429
				-
					-
						Honor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 430
				-
					-
						Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 431
				-
					-
						'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 432
				-
					-
						She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 433
				-
					-
						Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 434
				-
					-
						She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 435
				-
					-
						The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 436
				-
					-
						She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 437
				-
					-
						Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 438
				-
					-
						The yawning earth rebellows to her call,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 439
				-
					-
						Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 440
				-
					-
						Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 441
				-
					-
						How loth I am to try this impious art!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 442
				-
					-
						Within the secret court, with silent care,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 443
				-
					-
						Erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 444
				-
					-
						Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 445
				-
					-
						Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 446
				-
					-
						Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 447
				-
					-
						Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 448
				-
					-
						All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 449
				-
					-
						For so the priestess and her charms require."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 450
				-
					-
						Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 451
				-
					-
						A mortal paleness in her face appears:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 452
				-
					-
						Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 453
				-
					-
						The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 454
				-
					-
						Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 455
				-
					-
						Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 456
				-
					-
						She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 457
				-
					-
						Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 458
				-
					-
						Within the secret court, expos'd in air.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 459
				-
					-
						The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 460
				-
					-
						And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 461
				-
					-
						Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 462
				-
					-
						And ev'ry baleful green denoting death.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 463
				-
					-
						The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 464
				-
					-
						The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 465
				-
					-
						And the man's image on the nuptial bed.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 466
				-
					-
						And now (the sacred altars plac'd around)
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 467
				-
					-
						The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 468
				-
					-
						And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 469
				-
					-
						Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 470
				-
					-
						And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 471
				-
					-
						And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 472
				-
					-
						With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 473
				-
					-
						Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 474
				-
					-
						With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 475
				-
					-
						Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 476
				-
					-
						And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 477
				-
					-
						Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 478
				-
					-
						Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 479
				-
					-
						A leaven'd cake in her devoted hands
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 480
				-
					-
						She holds, and next the highest altar stands:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 481
				-
					-
						One tender foot was shod, her other bare;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 482
				-
					-
						Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 483
				-
					-
						Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 484
				-
					-
						The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 485
				-
					-
						And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 486
				-
					-
						Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 487
				-
					-
						"'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 488
				-
					-
						Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 489
				-
					-
						The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 490
				-
					-
						Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 491
				-
					-
						The stars in silent order mov'd around;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 492
				-
					-
						And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 493
				-
					-
						The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 494
				-
					-
						Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 495
				-
					-
						Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 496
				-
					-
						Forgetting the past labors of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 497
				-
					-
						All else of nature's common gift partake:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 498
				-
					-
						Unhappy Dido was alone awake.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 499
				-
					-
						Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 500
				-
					-
						Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 501
				-
					-
						Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 502
				-
					-
						Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 503
				-
					-
						Then thus she said within her secret mind:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 504
				-
					-
						"What shall I do? what succor can I find?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 505
				-
					-
						Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 506
				-
					-
						And take my turn, to court and be denied?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 507
				-
					-
						Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 508
				-
					-
						Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 509
				-
					-
						Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 510
				-
					-
						'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 511
				-
					-
						Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 512
				-
					-
						Laomedon still lives in all his race!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 513
				-
					-
						Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 514
				-
					-
						Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 515
				-
					-
						What force have I but those whom scarce before
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 516
				-
					-
						I drew reluctant from their native shore?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 517
				-
					-
						Will they again embark at my desire,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 518
				-
					-
						Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 519
				-
					-
						Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 520
				-
					-
						And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 521
				-
					-
						Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 522
				-
					-
						Or seconded too well what I design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 523
				-
					-
						These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 524
				-
					-
						Had I continued free, and still my own;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 525
				-
					-
						Avoiding love, I had not found despair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 526
				-
					-
						But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 527
				-
					-
						Like them, a lonely life I might have led,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 528
				-
					-
						Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 529
				-
					-
						These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 530
				-
					-
						On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 531
				-
					-
						Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 532
				-
					-
						And order'd all things for his early flight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 533
				-
					-
						To whom once more the winged god appears;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 534
				-
					-
						His former youthful mien and shape he wears,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 535
				-
					-
						And with this new alarm invades his ears:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 536
				-
					-
						"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 537
				-
					-
						Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 538
				-
					-
						Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 539
				-
					-
						Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 540
				-
					-
						She harbors in her heart a furious hate,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 541
				-
					-
						And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 542
				-
					-
						Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 543
				-
					-
						Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 544
				-
					-
						The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 545
				-
					-
						And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 546
				-
					-
						Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 547
				-
					-
						And sail before the purple morn arise.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 548
				-
					-
						Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 549
				-
					-
						Woman's a various and a changeful thing."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 550
				-
					-
						Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 551
				-
					-
						Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 552
				-
					-
						Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 553
				-
					-
						The pious prince arose with hasty fear;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 554
				-
					-
						Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 555
				-
					-
						"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 556
				-
					-
						And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 557
				-
					-
						A god commands: he stood before my sight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 558
				-
					-
						And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 559
				-
					-
						O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 560
				-
					-
						To thy blest orders I resign my heart.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 561
				-
					-
						Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 562
				-
					-
						And prosper the design thy will commands."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 563
				-
					-
						He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 564
				-
					-
						His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 565
				-
					-
						An emulating zeal inspires his train:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 566
				-
					-
						They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 567
				-
					-
						With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 568
				-
					-
						And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 569
				-
					-
						Aurora now had left her saffron bed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 570
				-
					-
						And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 571
				-
					-
						When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 572
				-
					-
						Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 573
				-
					-
						She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 574
				-
					-
						And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 575
				-
					-
						Stung with despite, and furious with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 576
				-
					-
						She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 577
				-
					-
						"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 578
				-
					-
						"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 579
				-
					-
						Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 580
				-
					-
						To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 581
				-
					-
						Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 582
				-
					-
						Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 583
				-
					-
						What have I said? where am I? Fury turns
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 584
				-
					-
						My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 585
				-
					-
						Then, when I gave my person and my throne,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 586
				-
					-
						This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 587
				-
					-
						See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 588
				-
					-
						The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 589
				-
					-
						Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 590
				-
					-
						The burthen of his feeble father bore!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 591
				-
					-
						I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 592
				-
					-
						His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 593
				-
					-
						Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 594
				-
					-
						Have set the reeking boy before the sire.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 595
				-
					-
						Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 596
				-
					-
						Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 597
				-
					-
						My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 598
				-
					-
						Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 599
				-
					-
						At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 600
				-
					-
						And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 601
				-
					-
						Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 602
				-
					-
						Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 603
				-
					-
						Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 604
				-
					-
						Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 605
				-
					-
						Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 606
				-
					-
						All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 607
				-
					-
						Attend her curses and avenge her death!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 608
				-
					-
						If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 609
				-
					-
						Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 610
				-
					-
						Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 611
				-
					-
						His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 612
				-
					-
						Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 613
				-
					-
						His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 614
				-
					-
						Let him for succor sue from place to place,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 615
				-
					-
						Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 616
				-
					-
						First, let him see his friends in battle slain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 617
				-
					-
						And their untimely fate lament in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 618
				-
					-
						And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 619
				-
					-
						On hard conditions may he buy his peace:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 620
				-
					-
						Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 621
				-
					-
						But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 622
				-
					-
						And lie unburied on the barren sand!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 623
				-
					-
						These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 624
				-
					-
						And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 625
				-
					-
						Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 626
				-
					-
						Against the prince, the people, and the name.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 627
				-
					-
						These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 628
				-
					-
						Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 629
				-
					-
						Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 4: Verse 630
				-
					-
						When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						This said, within her anxious mind she weighs
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The means of cutting short her odious days.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With living drops; then let her come, and thou
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And end the cares of my disastrous love;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The nurse moves onward, with officious care,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And nature shiver'd at approaching death.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Then on the couch her trembling body cast,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						A glorious name, among the ghosts below.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						What could my fortune have afforded more,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						"And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						On any terms, 't is better than to live.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;
					-

						She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						First from the frighted court the yell began;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 65

						Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.

						Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 70

						"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;

				-

						These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,

					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						"All only to deceive unhappy me?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Not to be present at the fatal stroke?
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 80

						At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,

				-
					-
						Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 5: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."
					-
			-
				Book 4: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Or her own crime, but human casualty,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Which Proserpine and they can only know;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Nor made her sacred to the shades below.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Downward the various goddess took her flight,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And drew a thousand colors from the light;
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then stood above the dying lover's head,
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:
					-
				-
					Book 4: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.

					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 4

						A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head:

						Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:

						Then night and horror ocean's face deform.
					-
				-

						"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud

						My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,

						Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he,

					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy,
					-

						Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,

						And, not unmindful of his ancient race,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 48

						And held the hero in a strict embrace.

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-

						Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,

				-
					-
						And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 51

						His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;

				-
					-
						A day for ever sad, for ever dear.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 65

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 66

					-
						With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,

					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 67

					-
						Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,

						The name of great Anchises may be known,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 77

					-
						And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.

						Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,

						With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:

						Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn

						Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And others try the twanging bow to bend;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Let all be present at the games prepar'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 91

						And joyful victors wait the just reward.

					-
						But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."

						He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Then Helymus, by his example led,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						The gods permitted not, that you, with me,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						A serpent from the tomb began to glide;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass

						A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						More various colors thro' his body run,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Betwixt the rising altars, and around,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The sacred monster shot along the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Doubtful if this place's genius were,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						As many swine, and steers of sable hue;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The glad attendants in long order come,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Some blow the fires, and off entrails broil.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With rosy luster of the rising light:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The crowded shore with acclamations fill,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And first the gifts in public view they place,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And all prepare for their appointed games.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						In the great Centaur took the leading place;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						There stands a rock: the raging billows roar
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						In peace below the gentle waters run;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The mark to guide the mariners aright.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The lots decide their place. Above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						At once they start, advancing in a line:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						At once the brushing oars and brazen prow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Invade the field with half so swift a pace;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not the fierce driver with more fury lends
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With equal oars, advancing in a line;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now board to board the rival vessels row,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						In triumph rode, the victors of the main;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						More close to shore, and skim along the sand-
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						"Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						With louder cries the captain call'd again:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His rising rage) and careless of his own,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						In this, our common int'rest, let me find
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						But to be last, the lags of all the race!-
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The trembling rowers from their banks arise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						With iron poles they heave her off the shores,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And gather from the sea their floating oars.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Urge their success, and call the willing winds;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						In larger compass on the roomy sea.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						At first she flutters; but at length she springs
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 66
				-
					-
						To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						In vain the victor he with cries implores,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And practices to row with shatter'd oars.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						All obstinate to die, or gain the race.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For they can conquer, who believe they can.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Assist to make me guilty of my vow!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						His offer'd entrails cast into the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Your grateful gift and my return shall own."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The herald summons all, and then proclaims
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And three fat steers are to his vessel led,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And sums of silver, which the crew divide.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The victor honor'd with a nobler vest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And needlework its happy cost bestows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						There Ganymede is wrought with living art,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						When from aloft descends, in open view,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						With crooked talons bears the boy away.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						In single combat on the Trojan shore:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						In war for his defense, for ornament in peace.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The third, succeeding to the last reward,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						With figures prominent, and richly wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Is crush'd athwart her body by the load
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						From thence his way the Trojan hero bent
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Full in the midst of this fair valley stood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A native theater, which, rising slow
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A num'rous train attend in solemn state.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Here those that in the rapid course delight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Desire of honor and the prize invite.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The rival runners without order stand;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Euryalus a boy of blooming years,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Diores next, of Priam's royal race,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And owning old Acestes for their head;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With sev'ral others of ignobler name,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						"One common largess is for all design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						(The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The first of these obtains a stately steed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The quiver of an Amazonian dame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						A golden belt shall gird his manly side,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The third this Grecian helmet shall content."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						He said. To their appointed base they went;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Step after step, and almost side by side,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 58
				-
					-
						His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Had won, or left at least a dubious race.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 61
				-
					-
						When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The careless victor had not mark'd his way;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 65
				-
					-
						But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 66
				-
					-
						His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 67
				-
					-
						He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 70
				-
					-
						He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 72
				-
					-
						So Salius lay extended on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Next Helymus; and then Diores came,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 77
				-
					-
						By two misfortunes made the third in fame.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 78
				-
					-
						But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 79
				-
					-
						For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Urges his cause may in the court be heard;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 82
				-
					-
						But favor for Euryalus appears;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 83
				-
					-
						His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Who vainly reaches at the last reward,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 87
				-
					-
						If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 90
				-
					-
						But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 91
				-
					-
						At least to pity my deserving friend."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 92
				-
					-
						He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 93
				-
					-
						(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 94
				-
					-
						A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 96
				-
					-
						"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 97
				-
					-
						He said, "and falling is to rise by you,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 98
				-
					-
						What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Who merited the first rewards and fame?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 100
				-
					-
						In falling, both an equal fortune tried;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 102
				-
					-
						With this he pointed to his face, and show'd
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 103
				-
					-
						His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 105
				-
					-
						And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 108
				-
					-
						This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And equal justice in his gifts express'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 110
				-
					-
						The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Once more the princes bespeaks th' attentive crowd:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 112
				-
					-
						"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 113
				-
					-
						In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 114
				-
					-
						His opposite sustain in open view,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 117
				-
					-
						A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 119
				-
					-
						A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 122
				-
					-
						His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And loud applauses echo thro' the field.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Dares alone in combat us'd to stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 125
				-
					-
						The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 126
				-
					-
						The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 128
				-
					-
						And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Such Dares was; and such he strode along,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 131
				-
					-
						And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 132
				-
					-
						His brawny back and ample breast he shows,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 133
				-
					-
						His lifted arms around his head he throws,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 134
				-
					-
						And deals in whistling air his empty blows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 135
				-
					-
						His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Not one dares answer to the proud demand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Already he devours the promis'd prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 139
				-
					-
						He claims the bull with awless insolence,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 141
				-
					-
						"If none my matchless valor dares oppose,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 142
				-
					-
						How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Permit me, chief, permit without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 144
				-
					-
						To lead this uncontended gift away."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 145
				-
					-
						The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 146
				-
					-
						For the proud challenger demands the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 148
				-
					-
						The palm usurp'd without a victory,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 151
				-
					-
						"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 152
				-
					-
						So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 153
				-
					-
						A prize in triumph borne before your sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 154
				-
					-
						And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 156
				-
					-
						The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 158
				-
					-
						That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 161
				-
					-
						But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 162
				-
					-
						And scarce the shadow of a man remains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 163
				-
					-
						O could I turn to that fair prime again,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 164
				-
					-
						That prime of which this boaster is so vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 165
				-
					-
						The brave, who this decrepid age defies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 167
				-
					-
						He said; and, rising at the word, he threw
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 170
				-
					-
						And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 171
				-
					-
						With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 172
				-
					-
						The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 174
				-
					-
						With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Dares himself was daunted at the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 178
				-
					-
						And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 179
				-
					-
						"What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 182
				-
					-
						These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 184
				-
					-
						With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 185
				-
					-
						And these I wielded while my blood was warm,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 186
				-
					-
						This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 188
				-
					-
						But if the challenger these arms refuse,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 189
				-
					-
						And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 190
				-
					-
						If great Aeneas and Acestes join
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 191
				-
					-
						In his request, these gauntlets I resign;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Let us with equal arms perform the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 193
				-
					-
						And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 194
				-
					-
						This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 197
				-
					-
						A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 198
				-
					-
						Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 203
				-
					-
						With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 204
				-
					-
						One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 205
				-
					-
						One on his sinews and his giant size.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 206
				-
					-
						The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 207
				-
					-
						He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 208
				-
					-
						And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 211
				-
					-
						Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 213
				-
					-
						A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 214
				-
					-
						And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 216
				-
					-
						A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 218
				-
					-
						But with his warping body wards the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 219
				-
					-
						His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 220
				-
					-
						While Dares traverses and shifts his place,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 221
				-
					-
						And, like a captain who beleaguers round
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 224
				-
					-
						This and that other part in vain he tries,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 225
				-
					-
						And more on industry than force relies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 226
				-
					-
						With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 227
				-
					-
						But Dares watch'd the motion from below,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 7: Verse 228
				-
					-
						And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The fall'n companion of his youthful days.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He lays on load with either hand, amain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						But storms of strokes descend about his brows,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But now the prince, who saw the wild increase
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						"To him propitious, and averse to thee,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						'T is madness to contend with strength divine."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The sword and casque are carried by his train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But with his foe the palm and ox remain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The champion, then, before Aeneas came,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Learn what I was, by what remains; and know
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And, on his ample forehead aiming full,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The strife of archers with contending bows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With his own hands he raises on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The living mark at which their arrows fly.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The rival archers in a line advance,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The people shout. Upon the next was found
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And from the quiver each his arrow chose.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 61
				-
					-
						It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 67
				-
					-
						With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 68
				-
					-
						But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 71
				-
					-
						The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 73
				-
					-
						His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And, having first invok'd his brother god,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 75
				-
					-
						His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 77
				-
					-
						She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And renders back the weapon in the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Without a prize to gratify his pains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 82
				-
					-
						An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And latter augurs judge from this event.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 86
				-
					-
						A trail of following flames ascending drew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Across the skies as falling meteors play,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 90
				-
					-
						The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 92
				-
					-
						The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 96
				-
					-
						"The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 97
				-
					-
						And order'd you the prize without the lot.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 100
				-
					-
						This pledge of ancient amity receive,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Which to my second sire I justly give."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 102
				-
					-
						He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 108
				-
					-
						The chief, before the games were wholly done,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 110
				-
					-
						And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 111
				-
					-
						And, if his childish troop be ready join'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 112
				-
					-
						On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 113
				-
					-
						And lead his equals arm'd in just array."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 114
				-
					-
						He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 115
				-
					-
						The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And now the noble youths, of form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Advance before their fathers, in a line;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 9: Verse 118
				-
					-
						The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus marching on in military pride,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Shouts of applause resound from side to side.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His race in after times was known to fame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						New honors adding to the Latian name;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						White were the fetlocks of his feet before,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And on his front a snowy star he bore.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Of equal age, the second squadron led.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The last in order, but the first in place,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						First in the lovely features of his face,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And all the parents in the children view;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And hopes and fears alternate in their face.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						First make the circuit of the sandy plain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The second signal sounds, the troop divides
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Again they close, and once again disjoin;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then in a round the mingled bodies run:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						In other forms the military shew.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						At last, in order, undiscern'd they join,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And march together in a friendly line.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In a round error, which denied recess;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To their succeeding sons the graceful art;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 26
				-
					-
						But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And sends the goddess of the various bow,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To try new methods of revenge below;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Where in the port secure the navy lay.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 35
				-
					-
						She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The desart shore, and fleet without defense.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 38
				-
					-
						With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Their pity to themselves renews their cries.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 41
				-
					-
						"Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 42
				-
					-
						For us to sail! what labors to sustain!"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 43
				-
					-
						All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 47
				-
					-
						In face and shape old Beroe she became,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Once blest with riches, and a mother's name.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 52
				-
					-
						"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 54
				-
					-
						O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 11: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands,
					-
			-
				Book 5: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						We search in vain for flying Italy.

					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						What should our rest and rising walls withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						If still in endless exile we remain!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						What terrors from her frowning front arise!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 30
				-
					-
						What rays around her heav'nly face are seen!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Her age and anguish from these rites detain,"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 34
				-
					-
						She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 36
				-
					-
						They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 37
				-
					-
						They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The goddess, having done her task below,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The matrons prosecute their mad design:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 42
				-
					-
						They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 43
				-
					-
						The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Eumelus was the first the news to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 51
				-
					-
						While yet they crowd the rural theater.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 53
				-
					-
						A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 55
				-
					-
						His early warriors on his prancing steed,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 59
				-
					-
						He sent his voice before him as he flew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 60
				-
					-
						"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The last remainders of unhappy Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And on your friends your fatal fury turn.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 65
				-
					-
						He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 66
				-
					-
						In which the youths to sportful arms he led.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 67
				-
					-
						By this, Aeneas and his train appear;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Not so the raging fires their fury cease,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 74
				-
					-
						But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Can the victorious element withstand.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The pious hero rends his robe, and throws
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 85
				-
					-
						"O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 86
				-
					-
						If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 87
				-
					-
						If any spark of pity still remain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 88
				-
					-
						If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Or let thy fury fall alone on me!
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 92
				-
					-
						At this devoted head thy thunder throw,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And send the willing sacrifice below!"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 95
				-
					-
						From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 102
				-
					-
						But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 103
				-
					-
						If he should still in Sicily reside,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 105
				-
					-
						In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 109
				-
					-
						To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 111
				-
					-
						With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 112
				-
					-
						"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 113
				-
					-
						With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 114
				-
					-
						By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 117
				-
					-
						To him disclose the secrets of your mind:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Trust in his hands your old and useless train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 121
				-
					-
						The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 122
				-
					-
						With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 123
				-
					-
						The shock of battle with your foes by land.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Here you may build a common town for all,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 125
				-
					-
						And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 126
				-
					-
						The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 128
				-
					-
						'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 129
				-
					-
						His father's shade descended from the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 130
				-
					-
						And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 132
				-
					-
						O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 133
				-
					-
						The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 134
				-
					-
						On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 136
				-
					-
						The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 137
				-
					-
						And here the coward train and woman leave:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 138
				-
					-
						The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 140
				-
					-
						The stern Italians will their courage try;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 142
				-
					-
						But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 143
				-
					-
						And seek my shade among the blest below:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 144
				-
					-
						For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 146
				-
					-
						But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 147
				-
					-
						The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 148
				-
					-
						And blood of offer'd victims free the way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 149
				-
					-
						There shall you know what realms the gods assign,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 151
				-
					-
						But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 152
				-
					-
						And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 12: Verse 153
				-
					-
						He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.

						"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;

				-
					-
						"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						His country gods and Vesta then adores
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 7

						Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,

					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-

						Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						With his own purpose. All, without delay,

				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-

						The will of Jove, and his desires obey.

						Who dares not hazard life for future fame.

						Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.

						The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.

						This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,

						A chosen senate from the people draws;

						Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.

						Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And groves are planted round his blest abode.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then from the south arose a gentle breeze
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 29
				-
					-
						That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And call the merry mariners aboard.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Now loud laments along the shores resound,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Of parting friends in close embraces bound.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The trembling women, the degenerate train,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 39
				-
					-
						To their new master's care his fearful friends.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 40
				-
					-
						On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 41
				-
					-
						A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 43
				-
					-
						High on the deck the godlike hero stands,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 44
				-
					-
						With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 50
				-
					-
						To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 51
				-
					-
						"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 57
				-
					-
						As if 't were little to consume the town
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 59
				-
					-
						She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Let her the causes of her hatred tell;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 62
				-
					-
						But you can witness its effects too well.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 63
				-
					-
						You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 64
				-
					-
						That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 65
				-
					-
						When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 67
				-
					-
						With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 68
				-
					-
						To burn their fleet with execrable flames,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 70
				-
					-
						To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 71
				-
					-
						For what remains, your godhead I implore,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 73
				-
					-
						If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Secure his passage to the Latian land."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 76
				-
					-
						"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 77
				-
					-
						My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 80
				-
					-
						How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And drove before him headlong on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 85
				-
					-
						When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 86
				-
					-
						When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 88
				-
					-
						(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 89
				-
					-
						When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Of force unequal, and unequal gods;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 91
				-
					-
						I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 95
				-
					-
						My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 100
				-
					-
						His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 103
				-
					-
						High on the waves his azure car he guides;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 105
				-
					-
						And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The tempests fly before their father's face,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And monster whales before their master play,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 110
				-
					-
						The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 111
				-
					-
						To right and left; the gods his better side
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 115
				-
					-
						He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 116
				-
					-
						The cheerful crew with diligence obey;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 117
				-
					-
						They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Ahead of all the master pilot steers;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 119
				-
					-
						And, as he leads, the following navy veers.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 121
				-
					-
						The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 122
				-
					-
						When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 125
				-
					-
						To thee alone he takes his fatal way.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 127
				-
					-
						And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Then thus the traitor god began his tale:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 129
				-
					-
						"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 130
				-
					-
						The ships, without thy care, securely sail.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Will take the rudder and thy room supply."
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 133
				-
					-
						To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 134
				-
					-
						"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 135
				-
					-
						The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And to her faith commit the Trojan race?
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Shall I believe the Siren South again,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 138
				-
					-
						And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 139
				-
					-
						He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 141
				-
					-
						The god was wroth, and at his temples threw
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 142
				-
					-
						A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 143
				-
					-
						The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 146
				-
					-
						The god, insulting with superior strength,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 148
				-
					-
						And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 151
				-
					-
						The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 152
				-
					-
						While the ship sails without the pilot's care.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 153
				-
					-
						On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 154
				-
					-
						But what the man forsook, the god supplies,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 158
				-
					-
						And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 159
				-
					-
						And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 160
				-
					-
						The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 161
				-
					-
						The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 163
				-
					-
						The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 166
				-
					-
						"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,
					-
				-
					Book 5: Stanza 13: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."

						He said, and wept; then spread his sails before
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.
					-

					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The pious prince ascends the sacred hill
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Which hides from sight his venerable maid.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 14

						Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;

						Thence full of fate returns, and of the god.

						Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,

						And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.

						When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,

						(The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,

						To the Cumaean coast at length he came,

						And here alighting, built this costly frame.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 23

						Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 25

						Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd
					-

						The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The mournful parents stand around in tears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And rising Crete against their shore appears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						There too, in living sculpture, might be seen
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The mad affection of the Cretan queen;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The lower part a beast, a man above,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The monument of their polluted love.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Not to be found, but by the faithful clew;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Lent to the loving maid this last relief,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And all those erring paths describ'd so well
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Here hapless Icarus had found his part,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Each varying object his delight renew'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Eager to read the rest- Achates came,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And by his side the mad divining dame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						While to the temple she the prince invites.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						A spacious cave, within its farmost part,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						As many voices issue, and the sound
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Of Sybil's words as many times rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						"This is the time; enquire your destinies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Her color chang'd; her face was not the same,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Greater than humankind she seem'd to look,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						And with an accent more than mortal spoke.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						When all the god came rushing on her soul.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						"Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And now, at length, the flying coast is found.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Troy is no more, and can no more offend.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Th' event of things in dark futurity;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						To conquer and command the Latian state;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						For the long exiles of the Trojan race.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And annual rites, and festivals, and games,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						But O! commit not thy prophetic mind
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						The more she strove to shake him from her breast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						With more and far superior force he press'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Commands his entrance, and, without control,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 129
				-
					-
						"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Yet more and greater ills by land remain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 131
				-
					-
						The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						A new Achilles shall in arms appear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 137
				-
					-
						And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 139
				-
					-
						To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 141
				-
					-
						The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 142
				-
					-
						A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 143
				-
					-
						But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 144
				-
					-
						The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						And the resisting air the thunder broke;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						In these mysterious words his mind express'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						No frightful face of danger can be new.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-
					-
						The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 159
				-
					-
						This let me crave, since near your grove the road
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 160
				-
					-
						To hell lies open, and the dark abode
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						And lead me longing to my father's sight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 171
				-
					-
						His reverend image stood before my sight;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Conducted there by your unerring aid.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 174
				-
					-
						But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Oblige the father, and protect the son.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 178
				-
					-
						If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 179
				-
					-
						The ruthless king with pity could inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 180
				-
					-
						And from the shades below redeem his wife;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 181
				-
					-
						If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Could free his brother, and can daily go
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 183
				-
					-
						By turns aloft, by turns descend below-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 187
				-
					-
						My mother greater, my descent the same."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 188
				-
					-
						So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 189
				-
					-
						His hand upon the holy altar laid.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Then thus replied the prophetess divine:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 191
				-
					-
						"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 192
				-
					-
						The gates of hell are open night and day;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 194
				-
					-
						But to return, and view the cheerful skies,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 195
				-
					-
						In this the task and mighty labor lies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 196
				-
					-
						To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 197
				-
					-
						And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 198
				-
					-
						Betwixt those regions and our upper light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Deep forests and impenetrable night
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 202
				-
					-
						But if so dire a love your soul invades,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 203
				-
					-
						As twice below to view the trembling shades;

					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 204
				-
					-
						If you so hard a toil will undertake,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 205
				-
					-
						As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 207
				-
					-
						There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Conceal the happy plant from human sight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 210
				-
					-
						One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 211
				-
					-
						The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 212
				-
					-
						This from the vulgar branches must be torn,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 213
				-
					-
						And to fair Proserpine the present borne,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 215
				-
					-
						The first thus rent a second will arise,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 216
				-
					-
						And the same metal the same room supplies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 218
				-
					-
						The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Then rend it off, as holy rites command;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 220
				-
					-
						The willing metal will obey thy hand,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 223
				-
					-
						If not, no labor can the tree constrain;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 224
				-
					-
						And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 225
				-
					-
						Besides, you know not, while you here attend,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 226
				-
					-
						Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 227
				-
					-
						Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 228
				-
					-
						Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 229
				-
					-
						Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 230
				-
					-
						Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 231
				-
					-
						Then, living turfs upon his body lay:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 232
				-
					-
						This done, securely take the destin'd way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 233
				-
					-
						To find the regions destitute of day."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 234
				-
					-
						She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 236
				-
					-
						Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Achates, the companion of his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 240
				-
					-
						What friend the priestess by those words design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 241
				-
					-
						But soon they found an object to deplore:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 242
				-
					-
						Misenus lay extended the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 243
				-
					-
						Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 244
				-
					-
						The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 245
				-
					-
						With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 246
				-
					-
						And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 247
				-
					-
						He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 248
				-
					-
						Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 249
				-
					-
						But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 250
				-
					-
						He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 251
				-
					-
						Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 252
				-
					-
						He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 253
				-
					-
						With envy Triton heard the martial sound,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 254
				-
					-
						And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 255
				-
					-
						Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 256
				-
					-
						The gazing crowd around the body stand.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 257
				-
					-
						All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 258
				-
					-
						And hastens to perform the funeral state.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 259
				-
					-
						In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 260
				-
					-
						The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 261
				-
					-
						An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 262
				-
					-
						(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 263
				-
					-
						The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 264
				-
					-
						Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 266
				-
					-
						And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 267
				-
					-
						Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 269
				-
					-
						Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 270
				-
					-
						And by his pious labor urges theirs.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 271
				-
					-
						Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 272
				-
					-
						The ways to compass what his wish design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 273
				-
					-
						He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 274
				-
					-
						And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 275
				-
					-
						"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 276
				-
					-
						Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 277
				-
					-
						In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 278
				-
					-
						Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Two doves, descending from their airy flight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 281
				-
					-
						Secure upon the grassy plain alight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 282
				-
					-
						He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 283
				-
					-
						"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 284
				-
					-
						And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 286
				-
					-
						And thou, great parent, with celestial care,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 287
				-
					-
						In this distress be present to my pray'r!"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 288
				-
					-
						Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 289
				-
					-
						Observing still the motions of their flight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 290
				-
					-
						What course they took, what happy signs they shew.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 291
				-
					-
						They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 292
				-
					-
						Still farther from the place, but still in view:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 293
				-
					-
						Hopping and flying, thus they led him on
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 294
				-
					-
						To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 295
				-
					-
						They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 296
				-
					-
						Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 297
				-
					-
						Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 298
				-
					-
						As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 299
				-
					-
						Where the proud mother views her precious brood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 300
				-
					-
						And happier branches, which she never sow'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 301
				-
					-
						Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 302
				-
					-
						And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 303
				-
					-
						He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 304
				-
					-
						And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 305
				-
					-
						Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 307
				-
					-
						To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 308
				-
					-
						First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 309
				-
					-
						Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 310
				-
					-
						The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 311
				-
					-
						And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 312
				-
					-
						The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 313
				-
					-
						Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 314
				-
					-
						Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 315
				-
					-
						And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 316
				-
					-
						With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 317
				-
					-
						Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 318
				-
					-
						The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 319
				-
					-
						And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 320
				-
					-
						Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 321
				-
					-
						Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 322
				-
					-
						And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 323
				-
					-
						These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 324
				-
					-
						Then on the living coals red wine they pour;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 325
				-
					-
						And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 326
				-
					-
						Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 327
				-
					-
						Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 328
				-
					-
						And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 329
				-
					-
						Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 330
				-
					-
						Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 331
				-
					-
						But good Aeneas order'd on the shore
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 332
				-
					-
						A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 333
				-
					-
						A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 334
				-
					-
						Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 335
				-
					-
						Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 336
				-
					-
						These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 337
				-
					-
						Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 338
				-
					-
						Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 339
				-
					-
						From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 340
				-
					-
						And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 341
				-
					-
						And there th' unnavigable lake extends,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 342
				-
					-
						O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 343
				-
					-
						No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 344
				-
					-
						Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 345
				-
					-
						And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 346
				-
					-
						From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 347
				-
					-
						And give the name Avernus to the lake.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 348
				-
					-
						Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 349
				-
					-
						For sacrifice the pious hero brought.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 350
				-
					-
						The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 351
				-
					-
						Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 352
				-
					-
						Invoking Hecate hither to repair:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 353
				-
					-
						A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 354
				-
					-
						The sacred priests with ready knives bereave
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 355
				-
					-
						The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 356
				-
					-
						The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 357
				-
					-
						(The sable wool without a streak of white)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 358
				-
					-
						Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 359
				-
					-
						A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 360
				-
					-
						With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 361
				-
					-
						Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 362
				-
					-
						Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 363
				-
					-
						Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 364
				-
					-
						Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 365
				-
					-
						Nor ended till the next returning sun.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 366
				-
					-
						Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 367
				-
					-
						And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 368
				-
					-
						Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 369
				-
					-
						The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 370
				-
					-
						Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 371
				-
					-
						Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 372
				-
					-
						She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 373
				-
					-
						The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 374
				-
					-
						Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 375
				-
					-
						Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 376
				-
					-
						Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 377
				-
					-
						The mystic wonders of your silent state!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 378
				-
					-
						Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 379
				-
					-
						Along the waste dominions of the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 380
				-
					-
						Thus wander travelers in woods by night,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 381
				-
					-
						By the moon's doubtful and malignant light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 382
				-
					-
						When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 1: Verse 383
				-
					-
						And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And pale Diseases, and repining Age,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Full in the midst of this infernal road,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Of various forms unnumber'd specters more,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And Briareus with all his hundred hands;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And told him what those empty phantoms were:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Forms without bodies, and impassive air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						A sordid god: down from his hoary chin
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A youthful vigor and autumnal green.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And press for passage with extended hands.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The rest he drove to distance from the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Why to the shore the thronging people bent;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						"Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						He ferries over to the farther coast;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						A hundred years they wander on the shore;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 36
				-
					-
						He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His course from Afric to the Latian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The god foretold you should not die, before
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Your ship should run against the rocky coast.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						I floated, and discover'd land at last:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						High on a mounting wave my head I bore,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The cruel nation, covetous of prey,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which I have lost for this eternal night!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By your dead sire, and by your living son,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Without whose aid you durst not undertake
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						"What hopes delude thee, miserable man?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To view the Furies and infernal gods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Attend the term of long revolving years;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						In fetters one the barking porter tied,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:

					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 45

					-
						To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;

					-
						Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.

				-

						Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						This fatal present shall prevail at least."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						No more was needful: for the gloomy god

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 4

					-
						A venerable gift, so rarely seen.

				-
					-
						His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The pressing water pours within her sides.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						His passengers at length are wafted o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						No sooner landed, in his den they found
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The triple porter of the Stygian sound,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Nor want they lots, nor judges to review
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The wrongful sentence, and award a new.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The next, in place and punishment, are they
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Who prodigally throw their souls away;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						With late repentance now they would retrieve
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Their pains and poverty desire to bear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						So call'd from lovers that inhabit there.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						In secret solitude and myrtle shades
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						But ending in the sex she first began.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						"Unhappy queen! then is the common breath
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Of rumor true, in your reported death,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Have sent me to these regions void of light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Thro' the vast empire of eternal night.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 79
				-
					-
						My flight should urge you to this dire relief.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 81
				-
					-
						'T is the last interview that fate allows!"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 82
				-
					-
						In vain he thus attempts her mind to move
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 83
				-
					-
						With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 85
				-
					-
						But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And what he says and swears, regards no more
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 88
				-
					-
						But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Hid in the forest and the shades of night;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 6: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						All much lamented, all in battle slain;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Delight to hover near, and long to know
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He scarcely knew him, striving to disown
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His blotted form, and blushing to be known;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And therefore first began: "O Tsucer's race,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The place your armor and your name retains.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Your body too I sought, and, had I found,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Design'd for burial in your native ground."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						These are the monuments of Helen's love:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						You know in what deluding joys we pass'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						For, when the fatal horse, descending down,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Invites her former lord within my walls.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And with new treasons would redeem the past.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						What need I more? Into the room they ran,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And meanly murther'd a defenseless man.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						That fortune be their own another day!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						But answer you; and in your turn relate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Or tell what other chance conducts your way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The sun had finish'd more than half his race:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						"Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						'T is here, in different paths, the way divides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The left to that unhappy region tends,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;
					-
				-

						The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 60
				-
					-
						To pay my penance till my years expire.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And born to better fates than I have found."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 63
				-

						He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 64
				-
					-
						To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The hero, looking on the left, espied
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 66
				-
					-
						A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 67
				-
					-
						With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 9: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With adamantine columns, threats the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 6

					-
						And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And loud laments that rent the liquid air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Are all forbidden this polluted place.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						These are the realms of unrelenting fate;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He hears and judges each committed crime;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Enquires into the manner, place, and time.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						(Loth to confess, unable to conceal),
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						From the first moment of his vital breath,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						To his last hour of unrepenting death.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 31

						Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;

						With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.

					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 35

						More formidable Hydra stands within,

					-
						Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.

						The gaping gulf low to the center lies,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 10: Verse 39

					-
						The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,

						Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.

						Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)

					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 3

						Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-

						Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.

					-
						Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						For emulating Jove; the rattling sound
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Sought godlike worship from a servile train.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To rival thunder in its rapid course,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And imitate inimitable force!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 21
				-
					-
						There Tityus was to see, who took his birth
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 22
				-
					-
						From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Infold nine acres of infernal space.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 25
				-
					-
						A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The growing liver still supplied the feast;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Ixion and Perithous I could name,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 33
				-
					-
						High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 34
				-
					-
						That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 35
				-
					-
						They lie below, on golden beds display'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 46
				-
					-
						To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 51
				-
					-
						All these within the dungeon's depth remain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Their process, or the forms of law below.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 11: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 12
			-

					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(Could warning make the world more just or wise):
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To tyrants others have their country sold,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 13
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But let us haste our voyage to pursue:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The gate, and iron arch above it, stands
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 8
				-
					-
						On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Before our farther way the Fates allow,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Here must we fix on high the golden bough."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 11
				-
					-
						She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The prince with living water sprinkled o'er
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Possess'd the porch, and on the front above
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 17
				-
					-
						These holy rites perform'd, they took their way
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With ether vested, and a purple sky;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The blissful seats of happy souls below.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Some in heroic verse divinely sing;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Others in artful measures led the ring.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 28
				-
					-
						There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 13: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 14
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Here found they Tsucer's old heroic race,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Born better times and happier years to grace.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The chief beheld their chariots from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The love of horses which they had, alive,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And care of chariots, after death survive.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And poets worthy their inspiring god;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Those who to worth their bounty did extend,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And those who knew that bounty to commend.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The heads of these with holy fillets bound,

					-
						And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 25
				-
					-
						To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And first to him surrounded by the rest
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 27
				-
					-
						(Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 28
				-
					-
						"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To find the hero, for whose only sake
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 14: Verse 31
				-
					-
						We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 15
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 1
				-
					-
						To this the sacred poet thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 2
				-
					-
						"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 3
				-
					-
						In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 4
				-
					-
						By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The path conducts you to your journey's end."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 7
				-
					-
						This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And shews them all the shining fields below.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 9
				-
					-
						They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 13
				-
					-
						For future beings and new bodies wait-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In nature's order as they pass'd along:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 15: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 16
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 1
				-
					-
						In peaceful senates and successful war.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 4
				-
					-
						"Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 5
				-
					-
						O long expected to my dear embrace!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The love and pious duty which you pay
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 9
				-
					-
						'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 11
				-
					-
						What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 12
				-
					-
						What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 13
				-
					-
						How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 14
				-
					-
						When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To this, the filial duty thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 16
				-
					-
						"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 18
				-
					-
						After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 19
				-
					-
						My navy rides at anchor in the bay.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The dear embraces of your longing son!"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He said; and falling tears his face bedew:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 16: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;
					-
			-
				Book 6: Stanza 17
			-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And, just before the confines of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 3
				-
					-
						About the boughs an airy nation flew,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The winged army roams the fields around;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Which to the stream the crowding people draws.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To set before your sight your glorious race,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 17
				-
					-
						That this presaging joy may fire your mind
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To seek the shores by destiny design'd."-
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 19
				-
					-
						"O father, can it be, that souls sublime
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Return to visit our terrestrial clime,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Anchises then, in order, thus begun
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 24
				-
					-
						To clear those wonders to his godlike son:

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 25
				-
					-
						"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And flowing waters, and the starry flame,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And both the radiant lights, one common soul
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 29
				-
					-
						This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And birds of air, and monsters of the main.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;

					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 35
				-
					-
						As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Of mortal members, subject to decay,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 38
				-
					-
						From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 40

					-
						And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 41
				-
					-
						In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 42

					-
						Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind:

				-
					-
						Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 44
				-
					-
						But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The relics of inveterate vice they wear,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 47
				-

						For this are various penances enjoin'd;

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 17: Verse 49

						Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,

						All have their manes, and those manes bear:

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then are they happy, when by length of time
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No speck is left of their habitual stains,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But the pure ether of the soul remains.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 8
				-
					-
						But, when a thousand rolling years are past,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 9
				-
					-
						(So long their punishments and penance last,)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Of their past labors, and their irksome years,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 14
				-
					-
						That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The soul may suffer mortal flesh again."

						Thus having said, the father spirit leads

					-
						The priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades,

						The long procession of his progeny.

				-
					-
						Ceasar himself, exalted in his line;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Born to restore a better age of gold.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Afric and India shall his pow'r obey;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 78
				-
					-
						He shall extend his propagated sway
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Beyond the solar year, without the starry way,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Where Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around,

						And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd.

						At his foreseen approach, already quake

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 83

					-
						The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake:

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 18: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Their seers behold the tempest from afar,

				-

						Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates,

						Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar,

						From Nisus' top descending on the plains,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 8

					-
						With curling vines around his purple reins.

						And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue

						But what's the man, who from afar appears?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His hoary beard and holy vestments bring
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 15
				-

						He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain,

						Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.

				-
					-
						Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 18
				-
					-
						An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 19
				-
					-
						He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 21
				-
					-
						By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And scour his armor from the rust of peace.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 24
				-
					-
						But vain within, and proudly popular.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 27
				-
					-
						He first renews the rods and ax severe,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And gives the consuls royal robes to wear.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And long for arbitrary lords again,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With ignominy scourg'd, in open sight,

				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 32
				-
					-
						He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Unhappy man, to break the pious laws
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Of nature, pleading in his children's cause!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Howeer the doubtful fact is understood,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 36
				-
					-
						'T is love of honor, and his country's good:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The consul, not the father, sheds the blood.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Behold Torquatus the same track pursue;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And, next, the two devoted Decii view:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 41
				-
					-
						With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The pair you see in equal armor shine,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Now, friends below, in close embraces join;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 44
				-
					-
						But, when they leave the shady realms of night,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 46
				-
					-
						With mortal hate each other shall pursue:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 47
				-
					-
						What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 48
				-
					-
						From Alpine heights the father first descends;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 49
				-
					-
						His daughter's husband in the plain attends:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 50
				-
					-
						His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Nor stain your country with her children's gore!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Thou, of my blood, who bearist the Julian name!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Another comes, who shall in triumph ride,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And to the Capitol his chariot guide,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 57
				-
					-
						From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And yet another, fam'd for warlike toils,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 59
				-
					-
						On Argos shall impose the Roman laws,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Shall drag in chains their Achillean race;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And Pallas, for her violated place.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Great Cato there, for gravity renown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And conqu'ring Cossus goes with laurels crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The double bane of Carthage? Who can see
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Without esteem for virtuous poverty,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Severe Fabricius, or can cease t' admire
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 71
				-
					-
						The plowman consul in his coarse attire?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Tir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii claim;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Ordain'd in war to save the sinking state,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 75
				-
					-
						And, by delays, to put a stop to fate!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Let others better mold the running mass
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Of metals, and inform the breathing brass,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And soften into flesh a marble face;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Plead better at the bar; describe the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And when the stars descend, and when they rise.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 81
				-
					-
						But, Rome, 't is thine alone, with awful sway,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 82
				-
					-
						To rule mankind, and make the world obey,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 85
				-
					-
						These are imperial arts, and worthy thee."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 86
				-
					-
						He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 87
				-
					-
						The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 88
				-
					-
						"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 89
				-
					-
						He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 90
				-
					-
						He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Shall more than once the Punic bands affright;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Then to the Capitol in triumph move,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Aeneas here beheld, of form divine,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 97
				-
					-
						A godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 98
				-
					-
						With great Marcellus keeping equal pace;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 99
				-
					-
						But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 100
				-
					-
						He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 101
				-
					-
						What and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 102
				-
					-
						"His son, or one of his illustrious name?
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 103
				-
					-
						How like the former, and almost the same!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Observe the crowds that compass him around;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 105
				-
					-
						All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound:
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 106
				-
					-
						But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And night, with sable shades, involves his head."
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 108
				-
					-
						"Seek not to know," the ghost replied with tears,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 109
				-
					-
						"The sorrows of thy sons in future years.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 110
				-
					-
						This youth (the blissful vision of a day)
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 112

					-
						The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Were but their gifts as permanent as great.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 114
				-
					-
						What groans of men shall fill the Martian field!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 115
				-
					-
						How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 116
				-
					-
						What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 117
				-
					-
						When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 118
				-
					-
						No youth shall equal hopes of glory give,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 119
				-
					-
						No youth afford so great a cause to grieve;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Mirror of ancient faith in early youth!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Undaunted worth, inviolable truth!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 124
				-
					-
						No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 127
				-
					-
						When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse.
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 129
				-
					-
						A new Marcellus shall arise in thee!
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow;
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 133
				-
					-
						This gift which parents to their children owe,
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 134
				-
					-
						This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!"
					-
				-
					Book 6: Stanza 19: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Thus having said, he led the hero round
					-

					-
						The strength and customs of the Latian state;

					-
						Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:

						Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay.

						At length on oozy ground his galleys moor;

						Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee,

				-

				-
					-
						The nurse of great Aeneas' infancy.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						From land a gentle breeze arose by night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And the sea trembled with her silver light.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And cedar brands supply her father's light.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The roars of lions that refuse the chain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						These from their caverns, at the close of night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						With words and wicked herbs from humankind
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-

						Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With rising gales that sped their happy flight.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And from her face the breathing winds were blown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A sudden silence sate upon the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						That drove the sand along, he took his way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						About him, and above, and round the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The captain gives command; the joyful train
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Declare the past and state of things,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						These are my theme, and how the war began,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And how concluded by the godlike man:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Which princes and their people did engage;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						A larger scene of action is display'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The Latin scepter, and his people blest:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						His mother; fair Marica was her name.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						His birth from Saturn, if records be true.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Had Saturn author of his family.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Was blest with no male issue to succeed:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						One only daughter heir'd the royal state.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Among the crowd, but far above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Was kept and cut with superstitious care.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And last, in honor of his new abode,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						There with their clasping feet together clung,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And a long cluster from the laurel hung.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						An ancient augur prophesied from hence:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To the same parts on earth; his army lands;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						From thence the fuming trail began to spread
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And lambent glories danc'd about her head.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						This new portent the seer with wonder views,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						War shall the country waste, and change the state."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						For counsel to his father Faunus went,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						To these the Latian and the Sabine land
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And nightly visions in his slumber sees;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						These he consults, the future fates to know,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						When, from above, a more than mortal sound
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						A foreign son upon thy shore descends,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						When now the Trojan navy was in view.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						"See, we devour the plates on which we fed."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						The speech had omen, that the Trojan race
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Should find repose, and this the time and place.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						For thus Anchises prophesied of old,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						And this our fatal place of rest foretold:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And the long labors of your voyage end.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Remember on that happy coast to build,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						This was that famine, this the fatal place
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						To search the land, and where the cities lie,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						And what the men; but give this day to joy.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,
					-

					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Call great Anchises to the genial feast:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Thus having said, the hero bound his brows
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Adoring first the genius of the place,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And last his sire below, and mother queen above.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The time was come their city to renew.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						To found his empire, and his town to raise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A hundred youths from all his train selects,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And to the Latian court their course directs,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						(The spacious palace where their prince resides,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						They go commission'd to require a peace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And carry presents to procure access.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And palisades about the trenches plac'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						At length approach the walls. Without the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						They see the boys and Latian youth debate
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The martial prizes on the dusty plain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And some with darts their active sinews try.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						That foreign men of mighty stature came;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The king ordains their entrance, and ascends
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 40
				-
					-
						His regal seat, surrounded by his friends.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Supported by a hundred pillars stood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And round incompass'd with a rising wood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 46
				-
					-
						There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 47
				-
					-
						In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Their awful axes and the rods before.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And here the sacred senators repair;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 51
				-
					-
						All at large tables, in long order set,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 52
				-
					-
						A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And Italus, that led the colony;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And ancient Janus, with his double face,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 59
				-
					-
						There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 60
				-
					-
						On a short pruning hook his head reclines,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And honorable wounds from battle brought.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Above the rest, as chief of all the band,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 69
				-
					-
						His other wav'd a long divining wand.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 72
				-
					-
						For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 75
				-
					-
						She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 77
				-
					-
						With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 78
				-
					-
						In this high temple, on a chair of state,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Then gave admission to the Trojan train;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And thus with pleasing accents he began:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 82
				-
					-
						"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Were you by stress of weather cast aground?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 86
				-
					-
						(Such dangers as on seas are often seen,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And oft befall to miserable men,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Spent and disabled in so long a way?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Say what you want: the Latians you shall find
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 92
				-
					-
						For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 93
				-
					-
						His hospitable customs we retain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 94
				-
					-
						I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 96
				-
					-
						On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 97
				-
					-
						And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 98
				-
					-
						From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 99
				-
					-
						But after, when exempt from mortal earth,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 100
				-
					-
						From thence ascended to his kindred skies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 101
				-
					-
						A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 102
				-
					-
						He said. Ilioneus made this reply:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 103
				-
					-
						"O king, of Faunus' royal family!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 108
				-
					-
						From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 110
				-
					-
						The god began our line, who rules above;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 111
				-
					-
						And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And hither are we come, by his command,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 113
				-
					-
						To crave admission in your happy land.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 114
				-
					-
						How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 116
				-
					-
						What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Shook Asia's crown with European arms;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 120
				-
					-
						And such as, born beneath the burning sky
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 122
				-
					-
						From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Such length of years, such various perils past,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 124
				-
					-
						At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 125
				-
					-
						To beg what you without your want may spare:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 126
				-
					-
						The common water, and the common air;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Nor length of time our gratitude efface.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 132
				-
					-
						To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Despite not then, that in our hands we bear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 138
				-
					-
						These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 141
				-
					-
						To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 144
				-
					-
						And where Numicus opes his holy source.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Besides, our prince presents, with his request,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 147
				-
					-
						This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Anchises did in sacrifice employ;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 149
				-
					-
						This royal robe and this tiara wore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 151
				-
					-
						In full assemblies, and in solemn games;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 152
				-
					-
						These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 154
				-
					-
						His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 157
				-
					-
						But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 159
				-
					-
						On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 160
				-
					-
						And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 161
				-
					-
						This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 162
				-
					-
						To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 163
				-
					-
						This was the race that sure portents foreshew
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 164
				-
					-
						To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 165
				-
					-
						At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 166
				-
					-
						"The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 167
				-
					-
						To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And firm our purpose with their augury!

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Have what you ask; your presents I receive;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Partake and use my kingdom as your own;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 172
				-
					-
						All shall be yours, while I command the crown:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 173
				-
					-
						And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 176
				-
					-
						The peace is made when I behold him here.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 178
				-
					-
						I add to his commands my own request:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 179
				-
					-
						One only daughter heirs my crown and state,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 182
				-
					-
						With any native of th' Ausonian line.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 183
				-
					-
						A foreign son-in-law shall come from far
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 184
				-
					-
						(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 186
				-
					-
						And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Himself to be the man the fates require,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 188
				-
					-
						I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 189
				-
					-
						He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Of these he chose the fairest and the best,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 193
				-
					-
						To mount the Trojan troop. At his command
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 194
				-
					-
						The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 195
				-
					-
						With golden trappings, glorious to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 196
				-
					-
						And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Then to his absent guest the king decreed
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 198
				-
					-
						A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 201
				-
					-
						By substituting mares produc'd on earth,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 203
				-
					-
						These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 204
				-
					-
						And the rich present to the prince commends.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 206
				-
					-
						To their expecting lord with peace return.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 207
				-
					-
						But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 208
				-
					-
						As she from Argos took her airy flight,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 210
				-
					-
						She saw the Trojan and his joyful train
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 211
				-
					-
						Descend upon the shore, desert the main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 213
				-
					-
						Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 216
				-
					-
						"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 217
				-
					-
						O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 218
				-
					-
						Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 219
				-
					-
						But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 220
				-
					-
						When execrable Troy in ashes lay,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 225
				-
					-
						Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 226
				-
					-
						As if 't were little from their town to chase,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 227
				-
					-
						I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 228
				-
					-
						Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 229
				-
					-
						But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 230
				-
					-
						What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 231
				-
					-
						When these they overpass, and those they shun?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 232
				-
					-
						On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 234
				-
					-
						Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 235
				-
					-
						And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 236
				-
					-
						Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 237
				-
					-
						(What great offense had either people done?)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 238
				-
					-
						But I, the consort of the Thunderer,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 240
				-
					-
						With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 241
				-
					-
						And by a mortal man at length am foil'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 242
				-
					-
						If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 243
				-
					-
						To seek for needful succor from without?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 244
				-
					-
						If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 245
				-
					-
						Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 246
				-
					-
						Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 247
				-
					-
						The Trojan race to reign in Italy;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 248
				-
					-
						At least I can defer the nuptial day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 249
				-
					-
						And with protracted wars the peace delay:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 250
				-
					-
						With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 251
				-
					-
						And both the people near destruction brought;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 252
				-
					-
						So shall the son-in-law and father join,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 253
				-
					-
						With ruin, war, and waste of either line.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 254
				-
					-
						O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 255
				-
					-
						With Phrygian, Latian, andRutulian blood!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 256
				-
					-
						Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Another queen brings forth another brand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 258
				-
					-
						To burn with foreign fires another land!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 259
				-
					-
						A second Paris, diff'ring but in name,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 260
				-
					-
						Shall fire his country with a second flame."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 261
				-
					-
						Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 262
				-
					-
						With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 263
				-
					-
						To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 264
				-
					-
						Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 265
				-
					-
						This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 266
				-
					-
						One who delights in wars and human woes.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 267
				-
					-
						Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 269
				-
					-
						So frightful are the forms the monster takes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 270
				-
					-
						So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 271
				-
					-
						Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 272
				-
					-
						"O virgin daughter of eternal Night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 273
				-
					-
						Give me this once thy labor, to sustain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 274
				-
					-
						My right, and execute my just disdain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 275
				-
					-
						Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 276
				-
					-
						Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Expel from Italy that odious name,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 278
				-
					-
						And let not Juno suffer in her fame.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 279
				-
					-
						'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 281
				-
					-
						And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 283
				-
					-
						And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 284
				-
					-
						Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 286
				-
					-
						Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 287
				-
					-
						Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 288
				-
					-
						Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 289
				-
					-
						The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 290
				-
					-
						And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 291
				-
					-
						She to the Latian palace took her flight:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 292
				-
					-
						There sought the queen's apartment, stood before
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 293
				-
					-
						The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 294
				-
					-
						Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 295
				-
					-
						Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 296
				-
					-
						And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 297
				-
					-
						From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 298
				-
					-
						Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 299
				-
					-
						With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 300
				-
					-
						And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 301
				-
					-
						That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 302
				-
					-
						And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 303
				-
					-
						Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 304
				-
					-
						Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 305
				-
					-
						His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Now like a chain around her neck he rides,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 307
				-
					-
						Now like a fillet to her head repairs,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 308
				-
					-
						And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 309
				-
					-
						At first the silent venom slid with ease,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 310
				-
					-
						And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 311
				-
					-
						Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 312
				-
					-
						In plaintive accents she began the war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 313
				-
					-
						And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 314
				-
					-
						"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 315
				-
					-
						If nature plead not in a parent's heart,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 316
				-
					-
						Pity my tears, and pity her desert.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 317
				-
					-
						I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 318
				-
					-
						You in vain, reverse your cruel doom;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 319
				-
					-
						The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 320
				-
					-
						And bear the royal virgin far away!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 321
				-
					-
						A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 322
				-
					-
						In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 323
				-
					-
						And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 324
				-
					-
						Think on a king's inviolable word;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 325
				-
					-
						And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 326
				-
					-
						To this false foreigner you give your throne,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 327
				-
					-
						And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 328
				-
					-
						Resume your ancient care; and, if the god
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 329
				-
					-
						Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 330
				-
					-
						Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 331
				-
					-
						Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 332
				-
					-
						Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 333
				-
					-
						He springs from Inachus of Argive race."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 334
				-
					-
						But when she saw her reasons idly spent,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 335
				-
					-
						And could not move him from his fix'd intent,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 336
				-
					-
						She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 337
				-
					-
						Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 338
				-
					-
						She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 339
				-
					-
						And fills with horrid howls the public place.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 340
				-
					-
						And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 341
				-
					-
						On the smooth pavement of an empty court;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 342
				-
					-
						The wooden engine flies and whirls about,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 343
				-
					-
						Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout;

				-
					-
						They lash aloud; each other they provoke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 345
				-
					-
						And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 346
				-
					-
						Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 347
				-
					-
						Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 348
				-
					-
						Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 349
				-
					-
						And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 350
				-
					-
						She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 351
				-
					-
						Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 352
				-
					-
						Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 353
				-
					-
						And with these arts the Trojan match delays.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 354
				-
					-
						She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 355
				-
					-
						And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 356
				-
					-
						"Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 357
				-
					-
						And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 358
				-
					-
						"O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 359
				-
					-
						"O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 360
				-
					-
						"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 361
				-
					-
						And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 362
				-
					-
						Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 363
				-
					-
						All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 364
				-
					-
						All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 365
				-
					-
						Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 366
				-
					-
						And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 367
				-
					-
						The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 368
				-
					-
						Shook high above her head a flaming pine;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 369
				-
					-
						Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 370
				-
					-
						And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 371
				-
					-
						"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 372
				-
					-
						Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 373
				-
					-
						If there be here," she said, who dare maintain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 374
				-
					-
						My right, nor think the name of mother vain;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 375
				-
					-
						Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 376
				-
					-
						And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 377
				-
					-
						Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 378
				-
					-
						And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 379
				-
					-
						Then, when she found her venom spread so far,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 380
				-
					-
						The royal house embroil'd in civil war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 381
				-
					-
						Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 382
				-
					-
						And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 383
				-
					-
						His town, as fame reports, was built of old
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 384
				-
					-
						By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 385
				-
					-
						Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 386
				-
					-
						Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 387
				-
					-
						Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 388
				-
					-
						'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 389
				-
					-
						Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 390
				-
					-
						Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 391
				-
					-
						Betwixt the confines of the night and day,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 392
				-
					-
						Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 393
				-
					-
						Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 394
				-
					-
						The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 395
				-
					-
						Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 396
				-
					-
						Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 397
				-
					-
						Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 398
				-
					-
						Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 399
				-
					-
						Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 400
				-
					-
						Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 401
				-
					-
						Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 402
				-
					-
						Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 403
				-
					-
						Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 404
				-
					-
						"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 405
				-
					-
						In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 406
				-
					-
						Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 407
				-
					-
						Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 408
				-
					-
						The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 409
				-
					-
						The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 410
				-
					-
						Go now, deluded man, and seek again
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 411
				-
					-
						New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 412
				-
					-
						Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 413
				-
					-
						Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 414
				-
					-
						This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 415
				-
					-
						Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 416
				-
					-
						Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 417
				-
					-
						With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 418
				-
					-
						Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 419
				-
					-
						In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 420
				-
					-
						The Latian king, unless he shall submit,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 421
				-
					-
						Own his old promise, and his new forget-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 422
				-
					-
						Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 423
				-
					-
						And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 424
				-
					-
						For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 425
				-
					-
						With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 426
				-
					-
						"You tell me, mother, what I knew before:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 427
				-
					-
						The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 428
				-
					-
						I neither fear nor will provoke the war;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 429
				-
					-
						My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 430
				-
					-
						But time has made you dote, and vainly tell
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 431
				-
					-
						Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 432
				-
					-
						Go; be the temple and the gods your care;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 433
				-
					-
						Permit to men the thought of peace and war."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 434
				-
					-
						These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 435
				-
					-
						And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 436
				-
					-
						Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 437
				-
					-
						Her hideous looks and hellish form return;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 438
				-
					-
						Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 439
				-
					-
						And open all the furies of her face:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 440
				-
					-
						Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 441
				-
					-
						She cast him backward as he strove to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 442
				-
					-
						And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 443
				-
					-
						High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 444
				-
					-
						Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 445
				-
					-
						And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 446
				-
					-
						"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 447
				-
					-
						Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 448
				-
					-
						Behold the Fates' infernal minister!
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 449
				-
					-
						War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 450
				-
					-
						Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 451
				-
					-
						With her full force, she plung'd into his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 452
				-
					-
						Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 453
				-
					-
						Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 454
				-
					-
						"Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 455
				-
					-
						He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 456
				-
					-
						So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 457
				-
					-
						The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 458
				-
					-
						Above the brims they force their fiery way;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 459
				-
					-
						Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 460
				-
					-
						The peace polluted thus, a chosen band
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 461
				-
					-
						He first commissions to the Latian land,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 462
				-
					-
						In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 463
				-
					-
						To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 464
				-
					-
						To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 465
				-
					-
						And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 466
				-
					-
						Himself alone an equal match he boasts,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 467
				-
					-
						To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 468
				-
					-
						The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 469
				-
					-
						Their arms, and warn each other to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 470
				-
					-
						His beauty these, and those his blooming age,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 471
				-
					-
						The rest his house and his own fame ingage.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 472
				-
					-
						While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 473
				-
					-
						The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 474
				-
					-
						New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 475
				-
					-
						Which overlooks the vale with wide command;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 476
				-
					-
						Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 477
				-
					-
						With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 478
				-
					-
						And pitch their toils around the shady plain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 479
				-
					-
						The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 480
				-
					-
						And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 481
				-
					-
						'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 482
				-
					-
						High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 483
				-
					-
						From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 484
				-
					-
						The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 485
				-
					-
						The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 486
				-
					-
						Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 487
				-
					-
						Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 488
				-
					-
						Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 489
				-
					-
						Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 490
				-
					-
						The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 491
				-
					-
						To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 492
				-
					-
						His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 493
				-
					-
						And bathed his body. Patient of command
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 494
				-
					-
						In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 495
				-
					-
						He waited at his master's board for food;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 496
				-
					-
						Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 497
				-
					-
						Where grazing all the day, at night he came
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 498
				-
					-
						To his known lodgings, and his country dame.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 499
				-
					-
						This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 500
				-
					-
						Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 501
				-
					-
						As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 502
				-
					-
						In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 503
				-
					-
						Ascanius young, and eager of his game,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 504
				-
					-
						Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 505
				-
					-
						But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 506
				-
					-
						Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 507
				-
					-
						The bleeding creature issues from the floods,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 508
				-
					-
						Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 509
				-
					-
						His old familiar hearth and household gods.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 510
				-
					-
						He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 511
				-
					-
						Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 512
				-
					-
						Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 513
				-
					-
						For succor from the clownish neighborhood:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 514
				-
					-
						The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 515
				-
					-
						In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 516
				-
					-
						One with a brand yet burning from the flame,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 517
				-
					-
						Arm'd with a knotty club another came:
					-

				-
					-
						Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 519
				-
					-
						Their fury makes an instrument of war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 520
				-
					-
						Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 521
				-
					-
						Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 522
				-
					-
						But held his hand from the descending stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 523
				-
					-
						And left his wedge within the cloven oak,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 524
				-
					-
						To whet their courage and their rage provoke.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 525
				-
					-
						And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 526
				-
					-
						Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 527
				-
					-
						Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 528
				-
					-
						Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 529
				-
					-
						Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 530
				-
					-
						And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 531
				-
					-
						The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 532
				-
					-
						The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 533
				-
					-
						Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 534
				-
					-
						Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 535
				-
					-
						And strain their helpless infants to their breast.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 536
				-
					-
						The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 537
				-
					-
						With furious haste to the loud summons flew.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 538
				-
					-
						The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 539
				-
					-
						With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 540
				-
					-
						Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 541
				-
					-
						But a firm body of embattled men.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 542
				-
					-
						At first, while fortune favor'd neither side,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 543
				-
					-
						The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 544
				-
					-
						But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 545
				-
					-
						Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 546
				-
					-
						A shining harvest either host displays,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 547
				-
					-
						And shoots against the sun with equal rays.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 548
				-
					-
						Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 549
				-
					-
						White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 550
				-
					-
						Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 551
				-
					-
						Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 552
				-
					-
						The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 553
				-
					-
						First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 554
				-
					-
						Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 555
				-
					-
						Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 556
				-
					-
						And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 557
				-
					-
						Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 558
				-
					-
						Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 559
				-
					-
						A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 560
				-
					-
						Amidst the madness of th' unruly train:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 561
				-
					-
						Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 562
				-
					-
						His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 563
				-
					-
						Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 564
				-
					-
						The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 565
				-
					-
						Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 566
				-
					-
						And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 567
				-
					-
						To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 568
				-
					-
						The blood already drawn, the war begun;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 569
				-
					-
						The discord is complete; nor can they cease
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 570
				-
					-
						The dire debate, nor you command the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 571
				-
					-
						Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 572
				-
					-
						Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 573
				-
					-
						Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 574
				-
					-
						The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 575
				-
					-
						Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 576
				-
					-
						Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 577
				-
					-
						Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 578
				-
					-
						The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 579
				-
					-
						Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 580
				-
					-
						And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 581
				-
					-
						A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 582
				-
					-
						Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 583
				-
					-
						But thou with speed to night and hell repair;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 584
				-
					-
						For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 585
				-
					-
						Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 586
				-
					-
						Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 587
				-
					-
						The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 588
				-
					-
						Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 589
				-
					-
						In midst of Italy, well known to fame,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 590
				-
					-
						There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 591
				-
					-
						Below the lofty mounts: on either side
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 592
				-
					-
						Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 593
				-
					-
						Full in the center of the sacred wood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 594
				-
					-
						An arm arises of the Stygian flood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 595
				-
					-
						Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 596
				-
					-
						Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 597
				-
					-
						Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 598
				-
					-
						And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 599
				-
					-
						To this infernal lake the Fury flies;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 3: Verse 600
				-
					-
						Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.
					-

				Book 7: Stanza 4

				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Saturnian Juno now, with double care,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Attends the fatal process of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Implore the gods, and to their king complain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Proclaims his private injuries aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A solemn promise made, and disavow'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Increase the clamor, and the war demand,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Such was Amata's interest in the land,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Against the public sanctions of the peace,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Against all omens of their ill success.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						To force their monarch, and insult the court.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The raging tempest and the rising waves-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						He calls the gods to witness their offense,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						"Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						For me, my stormy voyage at an end,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						I to the port of death securely tend.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Is all I want, and all you take away."
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						A solemn custom was observ'd of old,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Their standard when in fighting fields they rear
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Or from the boasting Parthians would regain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And still are worship'd with religious fear)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Before his temple stand: the dire abode,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And the fear'd issues of the furious god,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The Roman consul their decree declares,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The youth in military shouts arise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						At her approach the brazen hinges fly;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And, like a tempest, issues out the war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						All these of old were places of renown.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Some twine young sallows to support the shield;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						With silver plated, and with ductile gold.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						The rustic honors of the scythe and share
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 94

						The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						And now the mighty labor is begun
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Their arms, and armies under their command;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						For well you know, and can record alone,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 110
				-
					-
						He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 113
				-
					-
						To Turnus only second in the grace
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Of manly mien, and features of the face.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 115
				-
					-
						A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 116
				-
					-
						With fates averse a thousand men he led:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 117
				-
					-
						His sire unworthy of so brave a son;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Himself well worthy of a happier throne.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Next Aventinus drives his chariot round
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 120
				-
					-
						The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 122
				-
					-
						His father's hydra fills his ample shield:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 123
				-
					-
						A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 124
				-
					-
						The son of Hercules he justly seems
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 125
				-
					-
						By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 127
				-
					-
						A mortal woman mixing with a god.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 128
				-
					-
						For strong Alcides, after he had slain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 130
				-
					-
						His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 131
				-
					-
						On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 133
				-
					-
						The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 134
				-
					-
						For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 135
				-
					-
						And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Like Hercules himself his son appears,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 137
				-
					-
						In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 138
				-
					-
						About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 139
				-
					-
						The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 141
				-
					-
						He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 143
				-
					-
						(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 147
				-
					-
						With rapid course descending to the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 148
				-
					-
						They rush along; the rattling woods give way;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 149
				-
					-
						The branches bend before their sweepy sway.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 153
				-
					-
						A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 154
				-
					-
						And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 155
				-
					-
						His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 156
				-
					-
						With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 157
				-
					-
						Besides the succor which cold Anien yields,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 158
				-
					-
						The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 160
				-
					-
						A num'rous rout, but all of naked men:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 163
				-
					-
						But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 164
				-
					-
						And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 165
				-
					-
						The left foot naked, when they march to fight,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 166
				-
					-
						But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 169
				-
					-
						In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 170
				-
					-
						A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 171
				-
					-
						The just Faliscans he to battle brings,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 172
				-
					-
						And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 173
				-
					-
						And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 175
				-
					-
						All these in order march, and marching sing
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 176
				-
					-
						The warlike actions of their sea-born king;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Like a long team of snowy swans on high,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 179
				-
					-
						When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 180
				-
					-
						They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Not one who heard their music from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Would think these troops an army train'd to war,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 183
				-
					-
						But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 184
				-
					-
						With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 187
				-
					-
						And, in himself alone, an army brought.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 188
				-
					-
						'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 189
				-
					-
						The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 190
				-
					-
						To share the greatness of imperial Rome.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 191
				-
					-
						He led the Cures forth, of old renown,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 193
				-
					-
						And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 194
				-
					-
						That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 195
				-
					-
						And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 196
				-
					-
						And mountaineers, that from Severus came,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 197
				-
					-
						And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 198
				-
					-
						And those where yellow Tiber takes his way,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 199
				-
					-
						And where Himella's wanton waters play.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 201
				-
					-
						By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 202
				-
					-
						The warlike aids of Horta next appear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 203
				-
					-
						And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 204
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 207
				-
					-
						When pale Orion sets in wintry rain;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 4: Verse 211
				-
					-
						Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 5

					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						High in his chariot then Halesus came,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						From Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						A thousand men the youthful hero led,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And those who live by Sidicinian shores,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Light demi-lances from afar they throw,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And these (as was the Teuton use of old)
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Hippolytus, as old records have said,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But, when no female arts his mind could move,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						She turn'd to furious hate her impious love.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd.
					-
				-

						Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The dead inspir'd with vital breath again,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Struck to the center, with his flaming dart,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						But Trivia kept in secret shades alone
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Amid the troops, and like the leading god,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The more the kindled combat rises high'r,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The more with fury burns the blazing fire.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						With horns exalted stands, and seems to low-
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 80
				-
					-
						A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 81
				-
					-
						To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 84
				-
					-
						A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 5: Verse 85
				-
					-
						With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;
					-
			-
				Book 7: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And those who near Numician streams reside,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Or Circe's hills from the main land divide;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Or the black water of Pomptina stands.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						She chose the nobler Pallas of the field.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Her purple habit sits with such a grace
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And in a golden caul the curls are bound.
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind,
					-
				-
					Book 7: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.

					-
						When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Had giv'n the signal of approaching war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						These thro' the country took their wasteful course,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fields to forage, and to gather force.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then Venulus to Diomede they send,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Declare the common danger, and inform
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The Grecian leader of the growing storm:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And claim'd a title from the gods and fate;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						What num'rous nations in his quarrel came,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And how they spread his formidable name.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						What he design'd, what mischief might arise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						If fortune favor'd his first enterprise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And common interest, was involv'd in theirs.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						This way and that he turns his anxious mind;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And gives no rest to his distracted heart.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The glitt'ring species here and there divide,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And cast their dubious beams from side to side;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And found in silent slumber late relief.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Arose the father of the Roman flood;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						An azure robe was o'er his body spread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						O long expected in this promis'd place!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						This is thy happy home, the clime where fate
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And that this nightly vision may not seem
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						All white herself, and white her thirty young.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						When thirty rolling years have run their race,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Which from this omen shall receive the name.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And how with sure success to crown thy pains,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						With patience next attend. A banish'd band,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						But the fierce Latians old possession claim,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						With war infesting the new colony.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						To thy free passage I submit my streams.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And, when the setting stars are lost in day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						When thou return'st victorious from the war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						The god am I, whose yellow water flows
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Tiber my name; among the rolling floods
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						This is my certain seat. In times to come,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						With purple blushing, and the day arise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Then water in his hollow palm he took
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						For this thy kind compassion of our woes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						But, O be present to thy people's aid,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						She white herself, and white her thirty young.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-

						The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 122

						Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.

					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Shouts from the land give omen to their course,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						The woods and waters wonder at the gleam
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						One summer's night and one whole day they pass
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 131
				-
					-
						When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 132
				-
					-
						The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 137
				-
					-
						'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 138
				-
					-
						The king and prince, without the city gates,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 140
				-
					-
						To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And fat of entrails on his altar fries.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 143
				-
					-
						But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 144
				-
					-
						And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						To pay the rites. Himself without delay
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						High on the stern Aeneas his stand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						And held a branch of olive in his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-
					-
						This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						The youth replies: "Whatever you require,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 172
				-
					-
						From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 173
				-
					-
						And both the brother kings your kindred claim;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Have led me hither, less by need than choice.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 179
				-
					-
						And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Electra from the loins of Atlas came;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Your sire is Mercury, whom long before
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 183
				-
					-
						On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Thus from one common source our streams divide;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Areadian side.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 189
				-
					-
						Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 190
				-
					-
						But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 191
				-
					-
						The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 192
				-
					-
						The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 194
				-
					-
						The victor troops from universal sway?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 196
				-
					-
						And either sea from side to side command.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 198
				-
					-
						Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 199
				-
					-
						We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 200
				-
					-
						In council cautious, and in fields we dare."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 201
				-
					-
						He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 204
				-
					-
						Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 205
				-
					-
						"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 206
				-
					-
						In whom the features of thy father shine,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 207
				-
					-
						How I recall Anchises! how I see
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 208
				-
					-
						His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 210
				-
					-
						When Priam to his sister's court design'd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 211
				-
					-
						A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 212
				-
					-
						And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 213
				-
					-
						Then, past a boy, the callow down began
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 214
				-
					-
						To shade my chin, and call me first a man.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 215
				-
					-
						I saw the shining train with vast delight,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 216
				-
					-
						And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 217
				-
					-
						But great Anchises, far above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 218
				-
					-
						With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 219
				-
					-
						I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 221
				-
					-
						I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 222
				-
					-
						And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 223
				-
					-
						He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 224
				-
					-
						A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 225
				-
					-
						A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 226
				-
					-
						And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 227
				-
					-
						Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 228
				-
					-
						The league you ask, I offer, as your right;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 229
				-
					-
						And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 230
				-
					-
						With swift supplies you shall be sent away.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 231
				-
					-
						Now celebrate with us this solemn day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Whose holy rites admit no long delay.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 234
				-
					-
						With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 236
				-
					-
						The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 237
				-
					-
						On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 238
				-
					-
						A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 240
				-
					-
						A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 241
				-
					-
						The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 242
				-
					-
						In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 1: Verse 243
				-
					-
						Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						From no vain fears or superstition spring,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The labors of a god we recompense.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around

					-
						With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,

						The pavement ever foul with human gore;

						Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,

				-
					-
						Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 22

						Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.

				-
					-
						And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 33

					-
						He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.

				-
					-
						The tracks averse a lying notice gave,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 35

						"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,

						One heifer, who had heard her love complain,

				-
					-
						Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.

				-

				-
					-
						Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 43

					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						With winged speed the circuit of the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And nodded to the left. The hero stood
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The cavern glares with new-admitted light.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						The ghosts repine at violated night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The graceless monster, caught in open day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Howls horrible from underneath, and fills
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						His hollow palace with unmanly yells.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						The hero stands above, and from afar
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The wrathful god then plunges from above,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And in a knot his crippled members bound;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						From that auspicious day, with rites divine,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						We worship at the hero's holy shrine.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						As priests, were added the Pinarian house,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And with deep draughts invoke our common god."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And poplars black and white his temples bind.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then brims his ample bowl. With like design
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Meantime the sun descended from the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And the bright evening star began to rise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And now the priests, Potitius at their head,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Then with a second course the tables load,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And with full chargers offer to the god.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The Salii sing, and cense his altars round
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						One choir of old, another of the young,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The lay records the labors, and the praise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The serpents strangled with his infant hands;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The triple porter of the Stygian seat,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						To heav'n and the great author of thy race!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The stranger cast around his curious eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						New objects viewing still, with new surprise;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						With greedy joy enquires of various things,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And acts and monuments of ancient kings.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Their exercise the chase; the running flood
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						A more degenerate and discolor'd age
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						For Tiber's flood was Albula before,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Where stood an altar, sacred to the name
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Then shews the forest, which, in after times,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						A reverent fear (such superstition reigns
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And either place the founder's name retains.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Discoursing thus together, they resort
					-

						Where poor Evander kept his country court.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 29

					-
						They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Which feasted him, and emulate a god."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Then underneath a lowly roof he led
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Now Night had shed her silver dews around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						With these alluring words invokes his aid;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Inspires each accent with the charms of love:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 53

					-
						A sinking empire longer to sustain,

					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 54

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 58

					-
						With humble suit I beg thy needful art,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 59

					-
						O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						To forge impenetrable shields, and grace
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						With fated arms a less illustrious race.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 64

						Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,

						With fire and sword my people to destroy,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						About her unresolving husband threw.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Or your own beauties or my love distrust?
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 81

						Th' artificer and art you might command,

				-
					-
						To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Confin'd their empire to so short a date.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And, if you now desire new wars to wage,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 86
				-
					-
						My skill I promise, and my pains engage.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Whatever melting metals can conspire,

					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 89

					-
						Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,

					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 90
				-
					-
						And think no task is difficult to love."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 92
				-
					-
						He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Now when the Night her middle race had rode,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 96
				-
					-
						And his first slumber had refresh'd the god-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The time when early housewives leave the bed;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 98
				-
					-
						When living embers on the hearth they spread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 100
				-
					-
						With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 101
				-
					-
						They ply the distaff by the winking light,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And to their daily labor add the night:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 104
				-
					-
						And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 110
				-
					-
						In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 117
				-
					-
						On their eternal anvils here he found
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 118
				-
					-
						The brethren beating, and the blows go round.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 119
				-
					-
						A load of pointless thunder now there lies
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 121
				-
					-
						These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Of winged southern winds and cloudy store
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 125
				-
					-
						As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 126
				-
					-
						And fears are added, and avenging flame.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 128
				-
					-
						His broken axletrees and blunted war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 129
				-
					-
						And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 130
				-
					-
						To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 131
				-
					-
						The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 132
				-
					-
						The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 134
				-
					-
						With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 135
				-
					-
						"My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Arms for a hero forge; arms that require
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 139
				-
					-
						He said. They set their former work aside,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And their new toils with eager haste divide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 141
				-
					-
						A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Alone sufficient to sustain the war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 146
				-
					-
						One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 147
				-
					-
						The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 148
				-
					-
						The grot with beaten anvils groans around.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 149
				-
					-
						By turns their arms advance, in equal time;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 150
				-
					-
						By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 151
				-
					-
						They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 152
				-
					-
						The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 153
				-
					-
						While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 155
				-
					-
						The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 156
				-
					-
						And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 157
				-
					-
						He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 159
				-
					-
						He sets his trusty sword upon his side,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 160
				-
					-
						And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Two menial dogs before their master press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 164
				-
					-
						But meets Aeneas in the middle space.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 166
				-
					-
						And true Achates waited on his friend.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 167
				-
					-
						They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 169
				-
					-
						"Undaunted prince, I never can believe
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 170
				-
					-
						The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 172
				-
					-
						But feeble are the succors I can send.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 174
				-
					-
						That other side the Latian state surrounds,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 176
				-
					-
						But mighty nations I prepare, to join
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 178
				-
					-
						You come, as by your better genius sent,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 179
				-
					-
						And fortune seems to favor your intent.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Of ancient building, and of high renown,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Who gave the name of Caere to the place,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 185
				-
					-
						In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 188
				-
					-
						What words can paint those execrable times,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 189
				-
					-
						The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 190
				-
					-
						That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 191
				-
					-
						On his own head, and on his impious race!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 192
				-
					-
						The living and the dead at his command
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 195
				-
					-
						The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 197
				-
					-
						The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 198
				-
					-
						The raging monster; but with arms beset
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 199
				-
					-
						His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 200
				-
					-
						They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 201
				-
					-
						They force his guards, and execute his friends.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 202
				-
					-
						He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 203
				-
					-
						To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 204
				-
					-
						By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,

						With arms, their king to punishment require:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 207
				-
					-
						My counsel shall submit to your command.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 209
				-
					-
						To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 210
				-
					-
						An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 211
				-
					-
						With these foreboding words restrains their hate:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 212
				-
					-
						'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 213
				-
					-
						Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 215
				-
					-
						To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 216
				-
					-
						Know this: no native of our land may lead
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 217
				-
					-
						This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 218
				-
					-
						Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 219
				-
					-
						And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 222
				-
					-
						The people join their own with his desire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 223
				-
					-
						And all my conduct, as their king, require.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 224
				-
					-
						But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 225
				-
					-
						And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 226
				-
					-
						And a soul conscious of its own decay,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 227
				-
					-
						Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 228
				-
					-
						My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 229
				-
					-
						And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 230
				-
					-
						And half a native; but, in you, combine

						A manly vigor, and a foreign line.

						Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,

				-
					-
						The staff of my declining days, my son,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Shall make your good or ill success his own;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 236
				-
					-
						In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 237
				-
					-
						And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Your matchless courage and your conduct view,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 239
				-
					-
						And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 240
				-
					-
						Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 242
				-
					-
						These in my name are listed; and my son
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 243
				-
					-
						As many more has added in his own."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 244
				-
					-
						Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 245
				-
					-
						With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 246
				-
					-
						Who, short of succors, and in deep despair,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 248
				-
					-
						But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 249
				-
					-
						To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 250
				-
					-
						Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 251
				-
					-
						And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 252
				-
					-
						Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 253
				-
					-
						And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 254
				-
					-
						Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 255
				-
					-
						The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 256
				-
					-
						The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 258
				-
					-
						Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 259
				-
					-
						Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 260
				-
					-
						Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 261
				-
					-
						(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 262
				-
					-
						Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 263
				-
					-
						Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 264
				-
					-
						My goddess mother, whose indulgent care
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 266
				-
					-
						This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 267
				-
					-
						Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 269
				-
					-
						Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 270
				-
					-
						Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 271
				-
					-
						And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 272
				-
					-
						Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 273
				-
					-
						And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 274
				-
					-
						He said, and, rising from his homely throne,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 275
				-
					-
						The solemn rites of Hercules begun,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 276
				-
					-
						And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Then cheerful to his household gods retires;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 278
				-
					-
						There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 279
				-
					-
						And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Next, of his men and ships he makes review;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 281
				-
					-
						Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Down with the falling stream the refuse run,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 283
				-
					-
						To raise with joyful news his drooping son.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 284
				-
					-
						Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 286
				-
					-
						A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 287
				-
					-
						The king himself presents his royal guest:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 288
				-
					-
						A lion's hide his back and limbs infold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 289
				-
					-
						Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 290
				-
					-
						Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 291
				-
					-
						Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 292
				-
					-
						The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 293
				-
					-
						And double their devotion in their fears.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 294
				-
					-
						The war at hand appears with more affright,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 295
				-
					-
						And rises ev'ry moment to the sight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 296
				-
					-
						Then old Evander, with a close embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 5: Verse 297
				-
					-
						Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 6

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						"Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then when I made the foremost foes retire,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						When Herilus in single fight I slew,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Relief, and hear a father and a king!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						My son return with peace and victory;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						If we shall meet again with more delight;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						But if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Have doom'd to death his undeserving head;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						This, O this very moment, let me die!
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						I strain him close within these aged arms;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!"
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						His servants bore him off, and softly laid
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The neighing coursers answer to the sound,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						A greenwood shade, for long religion known,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Which add a holy horror to the grove.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Their due devotions on his annual day.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Not far from hence, along the river's side,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Thether his warlike train the Trojan led,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Within a winding vale she finds her son,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And gives herself to his desiring eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						"Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 75
				-
					-
						And haughty Turnus to the field defy."
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 76
				-
					-
						She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 80
				-
					-
						He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 82
				-
					-
						His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 83
				-
					-
						One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:

						Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 85
				-
					-
						So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.

				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 86
				-
					-
						He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 87
				-
					-
						The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 88
				-
					-
						But most admires the shield's mysterious mold,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 90
				-
					-
						For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 91
				-
					-
						(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 92
				-
					-
						The wars in order, and the race divine
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 95
				-
					-
						There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 98
				-
					-
						They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 6: Verse 99
				-
					-
						She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.

						Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games

					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The Romans there with arms the prey defend.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						With imprecations on the perjur'd head.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And would by force restore the banish'd kings.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;
					-
				-

				-
					-
						The Roman youth assert their native rights.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Before the town the Tuscan army lies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						To guard the temple, and the temple's god.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The silver goose before the shining gate
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And golden chains on their white necks they wear.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And their left arm sustains a length of shield.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The Furies hissing from the nether ground.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 52
				-
					-
						But foaming surges there in silver play.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The dancing dolphins with their tails divide
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Actium surveys the well-disputed prize;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 61
				-
					-
						His beamy temples shoot their flames afar,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And o'er his head is hung the Julian star.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And, with propitious gods, his foes assails:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 65
				-
					-
						A naval crown, that binds his manly brows,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 66
				-
					-
						The happy fortune of the fight foreshows.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 72
				-
					-
						His ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The froth is gather'd, and the water glows.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 75
				-
					-
						It seems, as if the Cyclades again
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Were rooted up, and justled in the main;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 82
				-
					-
						With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms-
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 87
				-
					-
						The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Mars in the middle of the shining shield
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 91
				-
					-
						The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 92
				-
					-
						And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And shakes her iron rod above their heads.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 95
				-
					-
						This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 99
				-
					-
						The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Panting, and pale with fear of future death.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 103
				-
					-
						The god had figur'd her as driv'n along
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 104
				-
					-
						By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 106
				-
					-
						His arms and ample bosom to the tide,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 108
				-
					-
						In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 110
				-
					-
						And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 112
				-
					-
						With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 7: Verse 114
				-
					-
						The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,
					-
			-
				Book 8: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The domes with songs, the theaters with plays.

					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						All altars flame: before each altar lies,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And hangs the monumental crowns on high.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind;
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And Morini, the last of humankind.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						By Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus brought,
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought.
					-
				-
					Book 8: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,
					-

						And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race.

						While these affairs in distant places pass'd,

				-
					-
						The various Iris Juno sends with haste,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Retir'd alone she found the daring man,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Has left the Trojan camp without defense;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And, short of succors there, employs his pains
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Unite thy forces, and attack their lines."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						See, they divide; immortal day appears,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 22

						And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres!

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With joy, these happy omens I obey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And follow to the war the god that leads the way."

					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						In the main battle, with his flaming crest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Silent they move, majestically slow,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And the dark menace of the distant war.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						But close within their lines attend their chance.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						With twenty horse to second his designs,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						"Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						His leader's honor and his danger share?"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Behind the rampires and the battle shun,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And, impotent of anger, finds no way
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						In his distended paws to grasp the prey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						To force his foes in equal field to fight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Close underneath the walls; the washing tide
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Secures from all approach this weaker side.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And with a mother's majesty begun:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						"Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And on the summit rose a sacred grove,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Where I was worship'd with religious love.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The floating forests of the sacred pine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						But let it be their safety to be mine."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						"How dare you, mother, endless date demand
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						For vessels molded by a mortal hand?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						The chief is landed on the Latian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Whatever ships escape the raging storms,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						At my command shall change their fading forms
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And the black regions of his brother god.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						And now at length the number'd hours were come,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						When the great Mother of the Gods was free
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 129
				-
					-
						First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 130
				-
					-
						A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 133
				-
					-
						And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And know, my ships are my peculiar care.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 137
				-
					-
						With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 138
				-
					-
						With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 143
				-
					-
						No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 144
				-
					-
						When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						As rode before tall vessels on the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						And are by Jove for black presages sent.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						He takes the cowards' last relief away;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-
					-
						For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 160
				-
					-
						The liquid half of all the globe is lost;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Which myriads of our martial men surround.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						And land secure upon the Latian plains:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Shall such affronts as these alone inflame
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 171
				-
					-
						The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 172
				-
					-
						My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 173
				-
					-
						And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,

				-
					-
						They fell; but will they fall a second time?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 176
				-
					-
						One would have thought they paid enough before,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 177
				-
					-
						To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Can they securely trust their feeble wall,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 179
				-
					-
						A slight partition, a thin interval,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 181
				-
					-
						By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 183
				-
					-
						To force from out their lines these dastard bands.
					-

						Less than a thousand ships will end this war,

						Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.

						No wooden engine shall their town betray;

						Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,

						Give we the silent night to needful rest:

						The post of honor to Messapus falls,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 200
				-
					-
						To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 201
				-
					-
						To pitch the fires at distances around,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 202
				-
					-
						And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 204
				-
					-
						And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 205
				-
					-
						All clad in shining arms the works invest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 1: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;

			-
				Book 9: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thus all things needful for defense abound.

						Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Commission'd by their absent prince to share

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The common danger, and divide the care.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 12

					-
						The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,

					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						By turns relieve each other on the wall.

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His mother was a huntress of the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						One was their care, and their delight was one:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						One common hazard in the war they shar'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And now were both by choice upon the guard.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Eager of action, enemy to rest:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						This urges me to fight, and fires my mind
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						To leave a memorable name behind.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						By message both would hasten his return:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						If they confer what I demand on thee,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						(For fame is recompense enough for me,)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						A way that safely will my passage guide."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						With love of praise and noble envy struck;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Or send thee unassisted to the field?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Not so my father taught my childhood arms;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And think it over-sold to purchase fame."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Would minister new matter to my fears.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						This thy request is cruel and unjust.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						But if some chance- as many chances are,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						If one should reach my head, there let it fall,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And spare thy life; I would not perish all.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						To bear my mangled body from the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						O let not me the widow's tears renew!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Her age committing to the seas and wind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And but protract the cause you cannot gain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						The nodding watch; each to his office takes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						To find the council at the royal tent.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						All creatures else forgot their daily care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						They vote a message to their absent chief,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Remote from clamor, and secure from foes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						On their left arms their ample shields they bear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And beg admission, eager to be heard:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Expect each hour to see him safe again,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Nor can we be mistaken in the way;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						The rising turrets, and the stream between,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						While we behold such dauntless worth appear
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Then into tears of joy the father broke;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Each in his longing arms by turns he took;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						In recompense of such desert, decree?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The gods and your own conscious worth will give.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						By my dear country, by my household gods,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						That and my faith I plight into your hands,)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Make me but happy in his safe return,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Your common gift shall two large goblets be
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						With two great talents of the finest gold;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						And a large portion of the king's domains.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						No fate my vow'd affection shall divide
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Take full possession; all my soul is thine.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						My life's companion, and my bosom friend:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						My peace shall be committed to thy care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						And to thy conduct my concerns in war."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Then thus the young Euryalus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						The same shall be my age, as now my youth;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 168
				-
					-
						No time shall find me wanting to my truth.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 169
				-
					-
						This only from your goodness let me gain
					-
				-

						(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Of Priam's royal race my mother came-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 172
				-
					-
						And sure the best that ever bore the name-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 174
				-
					-
						From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 175
				-
					-
						My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 176
				-
					-
						(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,

						Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,

						And in this only act of all my life deceive.

					-
						By this right hand and conscious Night I swear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 180
				-
					-
						My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 181

						Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place
					-

						(Permit me to presume so great a grace)

						Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 184
				-

						That hope alone will fortify my breast

					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 185
				-

						Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 186
				-
					-
						He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 188
				-
					-
						That image of his filial piety:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 189
				-
					-
						"So great beginnings, in so green an age,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Exact the faith which I again ingage.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Creusa had, and only want the name.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 194
				-
					-
						'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 196
				-
					-
						(My father us'd it,) what, returning here
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,

				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 198
				-
					-
						That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 199
				-
					-
						He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 200
				-
					-
						From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 202
				-
					-
						And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 203
				-
					-
						This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 204
				-
					-
						A lion's hide, his body to defend;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 205
				-
					-
						And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 206
				-
					-
						With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 209
				-
					-
						With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 211
				-
					-
						And messages committed to their care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 213
				-
					-
						The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 215
				-
					-
						To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 216
				-
					-
						They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 218
				-
					-
						Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 220
				-
					-
						A medley of debauch and war, they lie.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 222
				-
					-
						"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 224
				-
					-
						There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 225
				-
					-
						And look around, while I securely go,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 226
				-
					-
						And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 227
				-
					-
						Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 228
				-
					-
						With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 229
				-
					-
						His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 230
				-
					-
						And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 231
				-
					-
						A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 232
				-
					-
						But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 234
				-
					-
						Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 235
				-
					-
						His armor-bearer first, and next he kills
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 236
				-
					-
						His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 237
				-
					-
						And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 239
				-
					-
						The gasping head flies off; a purple flood
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 240
				-
					-
						Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 242
				-
					-
						The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 243
				-
					-
						Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 244
				-
					-
						He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 245
				-
					-
						From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 246
				-
					-
						And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 248
				-
					-
						More lucky, had it lasted till the day.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 249
				-
					-
						The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 250
				-
					-
						O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 251
				-
					-
						And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 252
				-
					-
						Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 253
				-
					-
						Nor with less rage Euryalus employs
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 254
				-
					-
						The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 255
				-
					-
						But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 256
				-
					-
						He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 258
				-
					-
						But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 259
				-
					-
						Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 260
				-
					-
						The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 261
				-
					-
						For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 262
				-
					-
						And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 263
				-
					-
						The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 264
				-
					-
						The purple soul comes floating in the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 266
				-
					-
						The fires were fainting there, and just alive;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 267
				-
					-
						The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 269
				-
					-
						"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 270
				-
					-
						And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 271
				-
					-
						Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 272
				-
					-
						Here let our glutted execution end.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 273
				-
					-
						A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 274
				-
					-
						The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 275
				-
					-
						Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 276
				-
					-
						A precious load; but these they leave behind.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 278
				-
					-
						To make the rich caparison his prey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Nor did his eyes less longingly behold
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 281
				-
					-
						The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 282
				-
					-
						This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 283
				-
					-
						On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 284
				-
					-
						And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 285
				-
					-
						He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 286
				-
					-
						Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 287
				-
					-
						He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 288
				-
					-
						These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 289
				-
					-
						He to his body suits, but suits in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 290
				-
					-
						Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 291
				-
					-
						And laces on, and wears the waving crest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 292
				-
					-
						Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 293
				-
					-
						They leave the camp, and take the ready way.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 294
				-
					-
						But far they had not pass'd, before they spied
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 295
				-
					-
						Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 296
				-
					-
						The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 297
				-
					-
						But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 298
				-
					-
						And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 299
				-
					-
						They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 300
				-
					-
						His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 301
				-
					-
						On which the moon with full reflection play'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 302
				-
					-
						"'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 303
				-
					-
						"These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 304
				-
					-
						"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 305
				-
					-
						From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Silent they scud away, and haste their flight
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 307
				-
					-
						To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 308
				-
					-
						The speedy horse all passages belay,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 309
				-
					-
						And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 310
				-
					-
						And watch each entrance of the winding wood.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 311
				-
					-
						Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 312
				-
					-
						Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 2: Verse 313
				-
					-
						Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And fear, misled the younger from his way.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						"Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And treads the mazes of his former track.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						What should he next attempt? what arms employ,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And, casting on the moon a mournful look:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						If e'er my pious father, for my sake,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,
					-

						Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And in his body left the broken
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 39
				-
					-
						All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 40
				-
					-
						With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 41
				-
					-
						This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 46
				-
					-
						"Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 47
				-
					-
						With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 48
				-
					-
						That cruel sight the lover could not bear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 49
				-
					-
						But from his covert rush'd in open view,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And sent his voice before him as he flew:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 51
				-
					-
						"Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 52
				-
					-
						On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 53
				-
					-
						He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 55
				-
					-
						His only crime (if friendship can offend)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Is too much love to his unhappy friend."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 61
				-
					-
						His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 74
				-
					-
						With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 77
				-
					-
						O happy friends! for, if my verse can give
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The conqu'ring party first divide the prey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Then their slain leader to the camp convey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 83
				-
					-
						With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 88
				-
					-
						All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 89
				-
					-
						But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 93
				-
					-
						But added colors to the world reveal'd:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 94
				-
					-
						When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 95
				-
					-
						All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 96
				-
					-
						His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 97
				-
					-
						And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 98
				-
					-
						This done- to give new terror to his foes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 99
				-
					-
						The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 103
				-
					-
						They line their trenches, and they man their walls.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 104
				-
					-
						In front extended to the left they stood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 106
				-
					-
						But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 107
				-
					-
						They saw the faces, which too well they knew,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 109
				-
					-
						With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The mournful message to the mother's ears.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 112
				-
					-
						An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 114
				-
					-
						She runs the rampires round amidst the war,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 116
				-
					-
						And fills with loud laments the liquid air.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 117
				-
					-
						"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Thus looks the prop my declining years!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Not one kind kiss from a departing son!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 123
				-
					-
						No look, no last adieu before he went,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 124
				-
					-
						In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 126
				-
					-
						To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 128
				-
					-
						To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 129
				-
					-
						To call about his corpse his crying friends,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 131
				-
					-
						On his dear body, which I wove with care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 134
				-
					-
						His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 135
				-
					-
						For this, alas! I left my needful ease,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 137
				-
					-
						If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And send me thunderstruck to shades below!"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Unman their courage, and augment their fears;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 145
				-
					-
						But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 146
				-
					-
						To bear the madding mother to her tent.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 147
				-
					-
						And now the trumpets terribly, from far,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 148
				-
					-
						With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 149
				-
					-
						The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 150
				-
					-
						And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 151
				-
					-
						The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 152
				-
					-
						And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 153
				-
					-
						These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 155
				-
					-
						But, where void spaces on the walls appear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Or thin defense, they pour their forces there.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 157
				-
					-
						With poles and missive weapons, from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 158
				-
					-
						The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 160
				-
					-
						They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 161
				-
					-
						To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 163
				-
					-
						But could not bear th' unequal combat long;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 164
				-
					-
						For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 165
				-
					-
						The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 166
				-
					-
						And their crush'd heads become an easy prey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 167
				-
					-
						They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 168
				-
					-
						Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Contented now to gall them from below
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 170
				-
					-
						With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 172
				-
					-
						A blazing pine within the trenches threw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 173
				-
					-
						But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 175
				-
					-
						And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Inspire your poet in his high design,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 178
				-
					-
						To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 179
				-
					-
						What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 180
				-
					-
						What fame the soldiers with their captain share,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 181
				-
					-
						And the vast circuit of the fatal war;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 182
				-
					-
						For you in singing martial facts excel;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 183
				-
					-
						You best remember, and alone can tell.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 184
				-
					-
						There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 187
				-
					-
						To furnish all the strength that war requir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 188
				-
					-
						To level this, the bold Italians join;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 189
				-
					-
						The wary Trojans obviate their design;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 190
				-
					-
						With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 194
				-
					-
						It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 195
				-
					-
						The planks were season'd, and the timber dry.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 198
				-
					-
						The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 200
				-
					-
						Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Down the defense and the defenders fall.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 202
				-
					-
						The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 203
				-
					-
						The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 204
				-
					-
						The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 207
				-
					-
						All the same equal ruin underwent.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 211
				-
					-
						On one side royal, one a son of earth,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 213
				-
					-
						And sent her boasted bastard to the war
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 214
				-
					-
						(A privilege which none but freemen share).
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 216
				-
					-
						No marks of honor charg'd its empty field.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 218
				-
					-
						And rising, found himself amidst his foes;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 221
				-
					-
						And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 224
				-
					-
						And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 225
				-
					-
						So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 226
				-
					-
						His dying body on his thickest foes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 227
				-
					-
						But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 228
				-
					-
						Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 229
				-
					-
						Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 230
				-
					-
						And snatches at the beam he first can find;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 231
				-
					-
						Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 232
				-
					-
						In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 233
				-
					-
						But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 234
				-
					-
						(His spear had almost reach'd him in the way,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 236
				-
					-
						"Fool!" said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 238
				-
					-
						He said, and downward by the feet he drew
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 239
				-
					-
						The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 240
				-
					-
						Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 242
				-
					-
						Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 243
				-
					-
						Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 244
				-
					-
						Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 245
				-
					-
						So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 246
				-
					-
						In vain lamented by the bleating dam.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 248
				-
					-
						The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 249
				-
					-
						The ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 250
				-
					-
						Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 251
				-
					-
						Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 252
				-
					-
						To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 253
				-
					-
						Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 254
				-
					-
						It crush'd him double underneath the weight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 255
				-
					-
						Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 256
				-
					-
						To bend the bow young Liger better knew;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 258
				-
					-
						Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 259
				-
					-
						The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 260
				-
					-
						By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 261
				-
					-
						Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 262
				-
					-
						From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 263
				-
					-
						Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 264
				-
					-
						His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 265
				-
					-
						He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 266
				-
					-
						The second shaft came swift and unespied,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 267
				-
					-
						And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 269
				-
					-
						The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 270
				-
					-
						The son of Arcens shone amid the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 271
				-
					-
						In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 272
				-
					-
						(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,)
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 273
				-
					-
						Bred by his father in the Martian grove,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 274
				-
					-
						Where the fat altars of Palicus flame,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 275
				-
					-
						And send in arms to purchase early fame.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 276
				-
					-
						Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 277
				-
					-
						Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 278
				-
					-
						Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 279
				-
					-
						The heated lead half melted as it flew;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 280
				-
					-
						It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 281
				-
					-
						The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 283
				-
					-
						Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 284
				-
					-
						First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 285
				-
					-
						And exercis'd against a human foe-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 286
				-
					-
						With this bereft Numanus of his life,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 287
				-
					-
						Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 288
				-
					-
						Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 3: Verse 289
				-
					-
						Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Coop'd up a second time within your town!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Who dare not issue forth in open field,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						But hold your walls before you for a shield.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						What gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						We bear our newborn infants to the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						They wake before the day to range the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						No sports, but what belong to war, they know:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						No part of life from toils of war is free,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The body, not the mind; nor can control
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						We live by plunder, and delight in prey.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						In sloth you glory, and in dances join.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Your turbants underneath your chins are tied.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Where with unequal sound the flute invites;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						"Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And wide from east to west extend thy name;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						To thee a race of demigods below.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						From this beginning date the Julian line.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And plunging downward shot his radiant head;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The warlike prize thou hast already won.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The god of archers gives thy youth a part
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The combat thickens, like the storm that flies
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And with an armed winter strew the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						On Ida's top, two youths of height and size
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And of their own accord invite the war.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						With fates averse, against their king's command,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And waving crests above their heads appear.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						In flows a tide of Latians, when they see
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The gate set open, and the passage free;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Equicolus, that in bright armor shone,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Or in the well-defended pass they die.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						These with success are fir'd, and those with rage,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And each on equal terms at length ingage.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						The foes had left the fastness of their place,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The first he met, Antiphates the brave,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						But base-begotten on a Theban slave,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And Meropes, and the gigantic size
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 84
				-
					-
						(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 85
				-
					-
						But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 90
				-
					-
						His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 93
				-
					-
						At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 102
				-
					-
						With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 103
				-
					-
						The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 104
				-
					-
						New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 105
				-
					-
						But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Then black despair precipitates their flight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 107
				-
					-
						When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 108
				-
					-
						The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 109
				-
					-
						He turns the hinges of the heavy gate
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 5: Verse 110
				-
					-
						With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight
					-
			-
				Book 9: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						T' admit young Turnus, and include the war!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Too late his blazing buckler they descry,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His mighty members, and his ample breast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						His rattling armor, and his crimson crest.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						All but the fool who sought his destiny.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						No means of safe return by flight are left."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						My message to the ghost of Priam bear;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With his full force he whirl'd it first around;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Imperial Juno turn'd the course before,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						"But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god."
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And aim'd from high: the full descending blow
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And, had the victor then secur'd the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And to his troops without unclos'd the bars,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						One lucky day had ended all his wars.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Then Phalaris is added to his side.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And their friends' arms against their fellows threw.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall-
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						But, whom they fear'd without, they found within.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						He calls new succors, and assaults the prince:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But weak his force, and vain is their defense.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The helm flies off, and bears the head along.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						To save the living, and revenge the dead,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 74
				-
					-
						"O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 75
				-
					-
						"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 77
				-
					-
						One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 82
				-
					-
						This just reproach their virtue does excite:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 83
				-
					-
						They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 85
				-
					-
						But with slow paces measures back the field,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 88
				-
					-
						The more he loses, they advance the more,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 90
				-
					-
						They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 91
				-
					-
						They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 92
				-
					-
						As, compass'd with a wood of spears around,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 93
				-
					-
						The lordly lion still maintains his ground;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 96
				-
					-
						He loses while in vain he presses on,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 97

					-
						Nor will his courage let him dare to run:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 98
				-
					-
						So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 102
				-
					-
						But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 106
				-
					-
						For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 107
				-
					-
						To force th' invader from the frighted town.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 108
				-
					-
						With labor spent, no longer can he wield
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 110
				-
					-
						O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The weapons round his hollow temples ring;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 112
				-
					-
						His golden helm gives way, with stony blows
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 114
				-
					-
						His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 116
				-
					-
						The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 119
				-
					-
						With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 123
				-
					-
						The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 124
				-
					-
						And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore;
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,
					-
				-
					Book 9: Stanza 6: Verse 126
				-
					-
						And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.

						The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,

						From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,

					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						This backward fate from what was first design'd?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Why this protracted war, when my commands
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 13

						What fear or hope on either part divides

						Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 15

					-
						A lawful time of war at length will come,
					-

					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then is your time for faction and debate,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						For partial favor, and permitted hate.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Let now your immature dissension cease;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 23

						Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;

						But lovely Venus thus replies at large:

				-
					-
						And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.

				-
					-
						No spot of earth, no hospitable land,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 69

						(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 71

					-
						Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Inglorious let him live, without a crown.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The father may be cast on coasts unknown,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 78

						Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs:

				-
					-
						In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Obscurely let him rest; his right resign
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						To promis'd empire, and his Julian line.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 84

					-
						What profits it my son to scape the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						To pass the perils of the seas and wind;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Much better had he curb'd his high desires,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						To Simois' banks the fugitives restore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And give them back to war, and all the woes before."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 94

					-
						Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						"And must I own," she said, "my secret smart-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 96

					-
						What with more decence were in silence kept,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 98

						By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree,

						He left his native land for Italy!

					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Did I persuade to trust his second Troy
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						With walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						When have I urg'd him meanly to demand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Did I or Iris give this mad advice,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 112

					-
						You think it hard, the Latians should destroy
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 114

					-
						Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Their native air, nor take a foreign law!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						That Turnus is permitted still to live,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						To whom his birth a god and goddess give!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						But yet is just and lawful for your line
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Petition, while you public arms prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 125

						To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,

						And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 127

						From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away,

						And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea.

						You say, is absent: absent let him be.

						Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs,

				-
					-
						The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Why do you then these needless arms prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And thus provoke a people prone to war?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Or hinder from return your exil'd race?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 139

						Was I the cause of mischief, or the man

				-
					-
						Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 141

						Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied;

					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Your quarrels and complaints are now too late."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Just as they favor or dislike the cause.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						So winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						In whispers first their tender voices try,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Then issue on the main with bellowing rage,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						And storms to trembling mariners presage.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Then thus to both replied th' imperial god,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						(When he begins, the silent senate stand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-
					-
						And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 159
				-
					-
						"Celestials, your attentive ears incline!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Since," said the god, "the Trojans must not join
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						In wish'd alliance with the Latian line;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						Since endless jarrings and immortal hate
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Tend but to discompose our happy state;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						The war henceforward be resign'd to fate:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Equal and unconcern'd I look on all.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 170
				-
					-
						And, if she favors those, let those defend:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 171
				-
					-
						The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 172
				-
					-
						And shook the sacred honors of his head,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 174
				-
					-
						And the black regions of his brother god.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 1: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						This end the sessions had: the senate rise,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Within their walls the Trojan host inclose:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Yet in the face of danger some there stood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						So large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Or the great father of th' intrepid son.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And some with darts, and some with stones defend.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						His forehead circled with a diadem;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Directing pointed arrows from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						There Capys, author of the Capuan name,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						For, anxious, from Evander when he went,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						His name and country told, and ask'd relief;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						What Turnus, bold and violent, design'd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And to his wholesome counsel added pray'r.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Their forces trusted with a foreign hand.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Ida, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Revolving war's events, and various fate.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And what he suffer'd both by land and sea.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						A thousand youths brave Massicus obey,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 72
				-
					-
						From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 73
				-
					-
						For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						His stern Apollo's golden statue bore.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Six hundred Populonia sent along,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						All skill'd in martial exercise, and strong.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-
					-
						An isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Asylas on his prow the third appears,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 82
				-
					-
						From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						A thousand spears in warlike order stand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Sent by the Pisans under his command.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And his own Caere, sent three hundred men;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 98
				-
					-
						For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 99
				-
					-
						And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Heav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 103
				-
					-
						And wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 104
				-
					-
						His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 107
				-
					-
						With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						They seem'd to fear the formidable sight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Ocnus was next, who led his native train
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						From whence the Mantuan town derives the name-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						An ancient city, but of mix'd descent:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Three sev'ral tribes compose the government;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Four towns are under each; but all obey
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er.
					-

				Book 10: Stanza 3

				-
					-
						These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Him and his martial train the Triton bears;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						High on his poop the sea-green god appears:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And at the blast the billows dance around.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A hairy man above the waist he shows;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Full thirty ships transport the chosen train
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Now was the world forsaken by the sun,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And Phoebe half her nightly race had run.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						They know him from afar; and in a ring

						Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The curling ocean, and corrects the tides.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						She spoke for all the choir, and thus began
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And haste your course. Your navy once were we,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						From Ida's height descending to the sea;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Presum'd to violate our holy wood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 36
				-
					-
						(Unwillingly we broke our master's chain),
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 38
				-
					-
						The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And gave us life immortal in the seas.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 40
				-
					-
						But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 41
				-
					-
						By your insulting foes is hardly press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Advance in order on the Latian coast:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 44
				-
					-
						To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 47
				-
					-
						First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 50
				-
					-
						To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 54
				-
					-
						For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 59
				-
					-
						"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 60
				-
					-
						With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 64
				-
					-
						He said no more. And now renewing day
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Had chas'd the shadows of the night away.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 66
				-
					-
						He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 70
				-
					-
						His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 71
				-
					-
						His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 72
				-
					-
						The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 77
				-
					-
						King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And the swift ships descending on the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 82
				-
					-
						The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And dart diffusive fires around the field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And the keen glitt'ring the golden shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 87
				-
					-
						So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 90
				-
					-
						To man the shores, and hinder their descent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And thus awakes the courage of his friends:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 92
				-
					-
						"What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 93
				-
					-
						In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 94
				-
					-
						You find, and find him at advantage now.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Yours is the day: you need but only dare;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Your swords will make you masters of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 98
				-
					-
						And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Be mindful of the race from whence you came,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 102
				-
					-
						With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 104
				-
					-
						But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Then these elects, the landing to prevent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 106
				-
					-
						And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 109
				-
					-
						With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Where the tide languishes, and leap aland.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 114
				-
					-
						But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 115
				-
					-
						That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 116
				-
					-
						"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 118
				-
					-
						This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Let me securely land- I ask no more;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 121
				-
					-
						This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 122
				-
					-
						They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 123
				-
					-
						They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 124
				-
					-
						(Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 127
				-
					-
						She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 128
				-
					-
						And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Their broken oars and floating planks withstand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Their passage, while they labor to the land,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 131
				-
					-
						And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Advancing to the margin of the sea.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 134
				-
					-
						The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 135
				-
					-
						The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 138
				-
					-
						He first in open field defied the prince:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 139
				-
					-
						But armor scal'd with gold was no defense
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Against the fated sword, which open'd wide
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 141
				-
					-
						His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 145
				-
					-
						For his beginning life from biting steel was free.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Not far from him was Gyas laid along,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 151
				-
					-
						With great Alcides, while he toil'd below.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 152
				-
					-
						The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 3: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Of the fierce champions, with united force.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The prince then call'd Achates, to supply
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The spears that knew the way to victory-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						"Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Against our foes, on this contended plain."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						He stagger'd with intolerable smart.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						His helping hand, his brother to sustain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A second spear, which kept the former course,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						From the same hand, and sent with equal force,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then Numitor from his dead brother drew
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Preventing fate directs the lance awry,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						His forehead was the first that struck the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						He slew three brothers of the Borean race,
					-

						Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.

						Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:

				-
					-
						The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-

						Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,

						These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.

						With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,

						While on its borders each their claim decide.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-

						As wintry winds, contending in the sky,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 49

						With equal force of lungs their titles try:

						They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:

					-
						Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,

				-

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 54

						Both armies thus perform what courage can;

						Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.

						But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse

						With ill success ingage the Latin force:

				-

					-
						For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,

						They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight

						By my great sire, by his establish'd name,

						'T is thro' that forward path that we must come;

				-
					-
						With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 14

						See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The sea behind, our enemies before;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 16

					-
						No passage left, unless we swim the main;

					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						This said, he strode with eager haste along,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 19

					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Just where the bone distinguished either loin:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The nice distinction, and their fate divides:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The flying spear was after Ilus sent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Around the forest flies the furious blast,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						And all the leafy nation sinks at last,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						But first collected in his arms he stood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						It struck beneath the space of either eye;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 76
				-
					-
						But, when the father's mortal race was run,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 81
				-
					-
						To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 82
				-
					-
						"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 84
				-
					-
						His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 86
				-
					-
						For, while his shield protects a friend distress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 87
				-
					-
						The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 88
				-
					-
						But Lausus, no small portion of the war,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Permits not panic fear to reign too far,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 91
				-
					-
						But by his own example cheers the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 95
				-
					-
						They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 96
				-
					-
						To the rude shock of war both armies came;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 98
				-
					-
						The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Of equal youth and beauty both appear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 102
				-
					-
						But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 107
				-
					-
						With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 109
				-
					-
						"Let none presume his needless aid to join;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 111
				-
					-
						To this right hand is Pallas only due;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 112
				-
					-
						O were his father here, my just revenge to view!"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 113
				-
					-
						From the forbidden space his men retir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Jove is impartial, and to both the same."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 121
				-
					-
						He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Address'd himself on foot to single fight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 125
				-
					-
						And, as a lion- when he spies from far
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 126
				-
					-
						A bull that seems to meditate the war,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 130
				-
					-
						To rush from high on his unequal foe.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Within due distance of his flying lance,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 134
				-
					-
						If fortune would his want of force supply;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 135
				-
					-
						And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 136
				-
					-
						"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 137
				-
					-
						His son adjures you by those holy rites,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 138
				-
					-
						That hospitable board, those genial nights;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 140
				-
					-
						And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 141
				-
					-
						His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 144
				-
					-
						"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 145
				-
					-
						'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 146
				-
					-
						So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 148
				-
					-
						My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 150
				-
					-
						Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 151
				-
					-
						And stands already on the verge of death."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 152
				-
					-
						This said, the god permits the fatal fight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 153
				-
					-
						But from the Latian fields averts his sight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 154
				-
					-
						Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 156
				-
					-
						The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 157
				-
					-
						And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 159
				-
					-
						And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 161
				-
					-
						"See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 162
				-
					-
						The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 163
				-
					-
						By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 165
				-
					-
						His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 166
				-
					-
						In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 167
				-
					-
						The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 168
				-
					-
						He falls; his arms upon his body sound;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 169
				-
					-
						And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear,"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Said he; "my message to your master bear:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 173
				-
					-
						It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 174
				-
					-
						The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 176
				-
					-
						He said, and trampled down with all the force
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 179
				-
					-
						The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 181
				-
					-
						All in the compass of one mournful night,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 183
				-
					-
						In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 185
				-
					-
						O mortals, blind in fate, who never know
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 186
				-
					-
						To bear high fortune, or endure the low!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 187
				-
					-
						The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 189
				-
					-
						Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 190
				-
					-
						And curse the dire remembrance of the day.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 191
				-
					-
						The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Bear back the breathless body on a shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 193
				-
					-
						O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 194
				-
					-
						With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 195
				-
					-
						One day first sent thee to the fighting field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 197
				-
					-
						One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 198
				-
					-
						This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 199
				-
					-
						But sad spectators, to the hero came:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 200
				-
					-
						His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 202
				-
					-
						He whirls his sword around, without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 203
				-
					-
						And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 204
				-
					-
						To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 206
				-
					-
						To large deserts, are present to his eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 207
				-
					-
						His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 209
				-
					-
						He took in fight, and living victims led,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 210
				-
					-
						To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 211
				-
					-
						In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 212
				-
					-
						At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 213
				-
					-
						The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 215
				-
					-
						"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 216
				-
					-
						O spare my life, and send me back to see
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 217
				-
					-
						My longing sire, and tender progeny!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 218
				-
					-
						A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 219
				-
					-
						In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 220
				-
					-
						All these, and sums besides, which see no day,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 221
				-
					-
						The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 222
				-
					-
						If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 223
				-
					-
						A single soul's too light to turn the scale."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 224
				-
					-
						He said. The hero sternly thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 225
				-
					-
						"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 226
				-
					-
						Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 227
				-
					-
						All rules of war by one relentless stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 228
				-
					-
						When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 229
				-
					-
						My father's shadow, but my living son."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 230
				-
					-
						Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 231
				-
					-
						He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 234
				-
					-
						Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 235
				-
					-
						His holy fillets on his front appear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 236
				-
					-
						Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 239
				-
					-
						The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 240
				-
					-
						The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Sent him an off'ring to the shades below.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 242
				-
					-
						His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 243
				-
					-
						Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 244
				-
					-
						Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 245
				-
					-
						And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 246
				-
					-
						The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 247
				-
					-
						And seeks revenge himself on other foes.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 248
				-
					-
						At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 249
				-
					-
						Both shield and arm to ground together go.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 250
				-
					-
						Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 251
				-
					-
						And thought he wore impenetrable arms,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 252
				-
					-
						So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 253
				-
					-
						Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 254
				-
					-
						Then Tarquitus the field triumph trod;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 255
				-
					-
						A nymph his mother, his sire a god.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 256
				-
					-
						Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 257
				-
					-
						With his protended lance he makes defense;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 258
				-
					-
						Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 259
				-
					-
						Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 260
				-
					-
						Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 261
				-
					-
						Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 262
				-
					-
						Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 263
				-
					-
						Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 264
				-
					-
						The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 265
				-
					-
						"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 266
				-
					-
						Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 267
				-
					-
						Far from thy mother and thy native home,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 269
				-
					-
						Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 270
				-
					-
						On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 271
				-
					-
						Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 272
				-
					-
						They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 273
				-
					-
						Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 274
				-
					-
						Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 275
				-
					-
						Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 276
				-
					-
						In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 277
				-
					-
						And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 278
				-
					-
						And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 280
				-
					-
						Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 281
				-
					-
						Defied the forky lightning from afar;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 282
				-
					-
						At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 283
				-
					-
						And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 284
				-
					-
						In his right hand as many swords he wields,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 285
				-
					-
						And takes the thunder on as many shields:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 286
				-
					-
						With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 287
				-
					-
						And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 288
				-
					-
						When once his fauchion found the taste of blood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 289
				-
					-
						With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 290
				-
					-
						Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 291
				-
					-
						They, when they see the fiery chief advance,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 292
				-
					-
						And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 293
				-
					-
						Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 294
				-
					-
						They threw their master headlong from the chair.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 295
				-
					-
						They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 296
				-
					-
						They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 297
				-
					-
						Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 298
				-
					-
						With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 299
				-
					-
						And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 300
				-
					-
						Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 301
				-
					-
						His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 302
				-
					-
						Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 303
				-
					-
						Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 304
				-
					-
						To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 305
				-
					-
						Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 306
				-
					-
						Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 307
				-
					-
						Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 308
				-
					-
						Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 309
				-
					-
						Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 310
				-
					-
						Return'd his answer with his flying spear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 311
				-
					-
						As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 312
				-
					-
						Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 313
				-
					-
						Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 314
				-
					-
						And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 315
				-
					-
						Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 316
				-
					-
						Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 317
				-
					-
						Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 318
				-
					-
						"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 319
				-
					-
						Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 320
				-
					-
						But you yourself forsake your empty seat."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 321
				-
					-
						He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 322
				-
					-
						For Liger lay already on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 323
				-
					-
						By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 324
				-
					-
						The recreant thus his wretched life demands:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 325
				-
					-
						"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 326
				-
					-
						By her and him from whom thy breath began,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 327
				-
					-
						Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 328
				-
					-
						This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 329
				-
					-
						Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 330
				-
					-
						But the stern hero turn'd aside his head,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 331
				-
					-
						And cut him short: "I hear another man;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 332
				-
					-
						You talk'd not thus before the fight began.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 333
				-
					-
						Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 334
				-
					-
						Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 335
				-
					-
						Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 336
				-
					-
						And the soul issued at the gaping vent.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 337
				-
					-
						As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 338
				-
					-
						Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 339
				-
					-
						At length Ascanius and the Trojan train
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 340
				-
					-
						Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 341
				-
					-
						Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 342
				-
					-
						Held conference with his queen, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 343
				-
					-
						"My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 344
				-
					-
						Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 345
				-
					-
						Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 346
				-
					-
						With inborn valor force their fortune on?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 347
				-
					-
						How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 348
				-
					-
						Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 349
				-
					-
						To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 350
				-
					-
						Soft in her tone, submissively replies:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 351
				-
					-
						"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 352
				-
					-
						And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 353
				-
					-
						Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 354
				-
					-
						(As once I was) were mistress of your will,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 355
				-
					-
						From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 356
				-
					-
						Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 357
				-
					-
						Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 358
				-
					-
						And give him to his aged father's sight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 359
				-
					-
						Now let him perish, since you hold it good,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 360
				-
					-
						And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 361
				-
					-
						Yet from our lineage he derives his name,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 362
				-
					-
						And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 363
				-
					-
						Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 364
				-
					-
						And offers daily incense at your shrine."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 365
				-
					-
						Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 366
				-
					-
						"Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 367
				-
					-
						If for a little space, a lengthen'd span,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 368
				-
					-
						You beg reprieve for this expiring man,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 369
				-
					-
						I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 370
				-
					-
						From instant fate, and can so far dispense.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 371
				-
					-
						But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 372
				-
					-
						To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 373
				-
					-
						Or if a farther thought you entertain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 374
				-
					-
						To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 375
				-
					-
						To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 376
				-
					-
						"And what if that request, your tongue denies,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 377
				-
					-
						Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 378
				-
					-
						But length of certain life, to Turnus give?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 379
				-
					-
						Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 380
				-
					-
						If my presaging soul divines with truth;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 381
				-
					-
						Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 382
				-
					-
						And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 383
				-
					-
						Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 384
				-
					-
						And drives a storm before her thro' the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 385
				-
					-
						Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 386
				-
					-
						Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 387
				-
					-
						Of air condens'd a specter soon she made;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 388
				-
					-
						And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 389
				-
					-
						Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 390
				-
					-
						His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 391
				-
					-
						This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 392
				-
					-
						And that sustain'd an imitated shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 393
				-
					-
						With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 394
				-
					-
						Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 395
				-
					-
						(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 396
				-
					-
						Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 397
				-
					-
						The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 398
				-
					-
						And flourishes his empty sword in air.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 399
				-
					-
						At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 400
				-
					-
						The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 401
				-
					-
						Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 402
				-
					-
						And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 403
				-
					-
						"Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 404
				-
					-
						Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 405
				-
					-
						"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 406
				-
					-
						The fated land you sought so long by sea."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 407
				-
					-
						He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 408
				-
					-
						With eager pace pursued the flying shade.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 409
				-
					-
						By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 410
				-
					-
						Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 411
				-
					-
						The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 412
				-
					-
						For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 413
				-
					-
						And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 414
				-
					-
						Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 415
				-
					-
						Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 416
				-
					-
						Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 417
				-
					-
						The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 418
				-
					-
						With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 419
				-
					-
						And measures back with speed her former way.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 420
				-
					-
						Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 421
				-
					-
						And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 422
				-
					-
						The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 423
				-
					-
						And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 424
				-
					-
						Too late young Turnus the delusion found,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 425
				-
					-
						Far on the sea, still making from the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 426
				-
					-
						Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 427
				-
					-
						With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 428
				-
					-
						Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 429
				-
					-
						His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 430
				-
					-
						"O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 431
				-
					-
						Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 432
				-
					-
						Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 433
				-
					-
						How, and with what reproach, shall I return?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 434
				-
					-
						Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 435
				-
					-
						Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 436
				-
					-
						What will they say of their deserting chief
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 437
				-
					-
						The war was mine: I fly from their relief;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 438
				-
					-
						I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 439
				-
					-
						And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 440
				-
					-
						Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 441
				-
					-
						There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 442
				-
					-
						Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 443
				-
					-
						Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 444
				-
					-
						On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 445
				-
					-
						Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 446
				-
					-
						Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 447
				-
					-
						Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 448
				-
					-
						Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 449
				-
					-
						Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 450
				-
					-
						The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 451
				-
					-
						And now the sword, and now the sea took place,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 452
				-
					-
						That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 453
				-
					-
						Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 454
				-
					-
						By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 455
				-
					-
						Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 456
				-
					-
						But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 457
				-
					-
						And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 458
				-
					-
						And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 459
				-
					-
						At length she lands him on his native shores,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 460
				-
					-
						And to his father's longing arms restores.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 461
				-
					-
						Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 462
				-
					-
						Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 463
				-
					-
						His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 464
				-
					-
						Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 465
				-
					-
						Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 466
				-
					-
						Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 467
				-
					-
						Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 468
				-
					-
						All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 469
				-
					-
						He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 470
				-
					-
						To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 471
				-
					-
						From his proud summit looking down, disdains
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 472
				-
					-
						Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 473
				-
					-
						Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 474
				-
					-
						Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 475
				-
					-
						At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 476
				-
					-
						His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 477
				-
					-
						But Palmus from behind receives his wound;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 478
				-
					-
						Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 479
				-
					-
						His crest and armor, from his body torn,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 480
				-
					-
						Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 481
				-
					-
						Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 482
				-
					-
						Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 483
				-
					-
						Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 484
				-
					-
						The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 485
				-
					-
						But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 486
				-
					-
						Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 487
				-
					-
						And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 488
				-
					-
						With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 489
				-
					-
						When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 490
				-
					-
						By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 491
				-
					-
						He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 492
				-
					-
						Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 493
				-
					-
						All keep aloof, and safely shout around;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 494
				-
					-
						But none presumes to give a nearer wound:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 495
				-
					-
						He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 496
				-
					-
						And shakes a grove of lances from his side:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 497
				-
					-
						Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 498
				-
					-
						And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 499
				-
					-
						Their darts with clamor at a distance drive,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 500
				-
					-
						And only keep the languish'd war alive.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 501
				-
					-
						From Coritus came Acron to the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 502
				-
					-
						Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 503
				-
					-
						Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 504
				-
					-
						Proud of the purple favors of his bride.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 505
				-
					-
						Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 506
				-
					-
						A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 507
				-
					-
						Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 508
				-
					-
						He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 509
				-
					-
						He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 510
				-
					-
						The prey lies panting underneath his paws:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 511
				-
					-
						He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 512
				-
					-
						With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 513
				-
					-
						So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 514
				-
					-
						And first unhappy Acron overthrows:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 515
				-
					-
						Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 6: Verse 516
				-
					-
						The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Then turning short, he met him face to face,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						To give his victor the better grace.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Orodes falls, equal fight oppress'd:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The fields around with Io Paean! ring;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Who threw his master, as he made a bound:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						To single fight the boldest foe defied;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And not belied his mighty father's fame.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Salius to death the great Antronius sent:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						But the same fate the victor underwent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And mourn the miseries of human life.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Above the rest, two goddesses appear
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 56
				-
					-
						(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 57
				-
					-
						His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Collected in his strength, and like a rock,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 64
				-
					-
						He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 66
				-
					-
						"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 67
				-
					-
						(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 68
				-
					-
						His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 69
				-
					-
						By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 70
				-
					-
						He said; and with his utmost force he threw
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 71
				-
					-
						The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 73
				-
					-
						But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 79
				-
					-
						And in Evander's palace sought repose.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 81
				-
					-
						He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 82
				-
					-
						The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 86
				-
					-
						All these it pass'd, resistless in the course,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 88
				-
					-
						The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 89
				-
					-
						The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 90
				-
					-
						His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 92
				-
					-
						His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 93
				-
					-
						He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 95
				-
					-
						To thy immortal memory be just,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 96
				-
					-
						And sing an act so noble and so new,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Posterity will scarce believe 't is true.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 99
				-
					-
						The father sought to save himself by flight:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 102
				-
					-
						The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 103
				-
					-
						The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 106
				-
					-
						To see the son the vanquish'd father shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 107
				-
					-
						All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 108
				-
					-
						And with a storm of darts to distance drive
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 110
				-
					-
						On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 111
				-
					-
						As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 112
				-
					-
						The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 113
				-
					-
						For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 115
				-
					-
						But, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Return to travel, and renew their toils:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 118
				-
					-
						The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 7: Verse 119
				-
					-
						And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:
					-
			-
				Book 10: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						The youth desists, but with insulting scorn
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And lifted high the flaming sword appears,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Which, full descending with a frightful sway,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The purple streams thro' the thin armor strove,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And life at length forsook his heaving heart,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid
					-
				-

						Of early worth, and sure presage of more?

						Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 8: Verse 25

						Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;

						Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						A chosen train of youth around him stand;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						His drooping head was rested on his hand:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						He much enquir'd, and many a message sent
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To warn him from the field- alas! in vain!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And drew a bloody trail along the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The dire event, with a foreboding mind.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						"What joys, alas! could this frail being give,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						That I have been so covetous to live?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						To see my son, and such a son, resign
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						His life, a ransom for preserving mine!
					-
				-

					-
						And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						How much too dear has that redemption cost!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						'T is now my bitter banishment I feel:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-

						This is a wound too deep for time to heal.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.

						Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						With less resentment could have borne my fate.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Of hated men, and of more hated light:
					-
				-

					-
						But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						With pains or perils, for his courser call'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With daily care, and mounted with success;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me-
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						If life and long were terms that could agree!
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						This day thou either shalt bring back the head
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Or, if inexorable fate deny
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						For, after such a lord, rest secure,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 59
				-
					-
						With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 60
				-
					-
						His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 61
				-
					-
						With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 68
				-
					-
						The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 69
				-
					-
						"Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 71
				-
					-
						He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 72
				-
					-
						And threaten'd with his long protended spear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 73
				-
					-
						To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 74
				-
					-
						My Lausus lies extended on the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 75
				-
					-
						He's lost! thy conquest is already won;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The wretched sire is murther'd in the son.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 79
				-
					-
						But first receive this parting legacy."
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 80
				-
					-
						He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Another after, and another went.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 83
				-
					-
						And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 86
				-
					-
						The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Impatient of delay, and weary grown,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Still to defend, and to defend alone,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 89
				-
					-
						To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,

				-
					-
						Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 91
				-
					-
						At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Full at the temples of the warrior horse.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Down comes the rider headlong from his height:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 100
				-
					-
						His horse came after with unwieldy weight,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 101
				-
					-
						And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 102
				-
					-
						His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 103
				-
					-
						From either host, the mingled shouts and cries
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 106
				-
					-
						High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 107
				-
					-
						"Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 110
				-
					-
						With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 111
				-
					-
						"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 112
				-
					-
						To souls undaunted, and secure of death?
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 113
				-
					-
						'T is no dishonor for the brave to die,

						Nor came I here with hope victory;

						As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.

					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 117
				-
					-
						My dying son contracted no such band;
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 118

						The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.
					-
				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 119
				-
					-
						For this, this only favor let me sue,
					-
				-

						The last retreat of humankind, a grave.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Protect me from their vengeance after fate:

				-

				-
					-
						This refuge for my poor remains provide,

						And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."

						He said, and to the sword his throat applied.

				-
					Book 10: Stanza 9: Verse 128
				-
					-
						The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,

				-

					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Due to your dead companions of the war:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The last respect the living can bestow,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						To shield their shadows from contempt below.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						That conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And which for us with their own blood they bought;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						But first the corpse of our unhappy friend
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						To the sad city of Evander send,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Was hurried hence by too severe a doom."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						With equal faith, but less auspicious care.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						A troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						But, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						First, melting into tears, the pious man
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						"Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						She came; but brought not thee along, to bless
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						My longing eyes, and share in my success:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						To prosp'rous valor, in the public view.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Thy needless succor with a sad consent;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And sent me to possess a large command.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						He warn'd, and from his own experience told,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						To send him back his portion of the war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						A bloody breathless body, which can owe
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The wretched father, ere his race is run,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						These are my triumphs of the Latian war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						He died no death to make thee wish, too late,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!"
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						To raise the breathless body from the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						To bear him back and share Evander's grief:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						A well-becoming, but a weak relief.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						The body on this rural hearse is borne:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						For ornament the Trojan hero brought,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						The catching fire might burn the golden caul.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						When he descended on the Latian plain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						In long array- th' achievements of the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						With feeble steps, supported by his friends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 131
				-
					-
						To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 137
				-
					-
						The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 138
				-
					-
						The pikes and lances trail along the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 140
				-
					-
						To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 141
				-
					-
						In long procession rank'd, the pious chief
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 143
				-
					-
						"The public care," he said, "which war attends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!"
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 147
				-
					-
						He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 150
				-
					-
						A truce, with olive branches in their hand;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Obtest his clemency, and from the plain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 153
				-
					-
						They plead, that none those common rites deny
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 154
				-
					-
						To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 155
				-
					-
						All cause of hate was ended in their death;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 157
				-
					-
						A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Their suit, which was too just to be denied,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 160
				-
					-
						The hero grants, and farther thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 161
				-
					-
						"O Latian princes, how severe a fate
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 162
				-
					-
						In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 163
				-
					-
						And arm'd against an unoffending man,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Who sought your friendship ere the war began!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 165
				-
					-
						You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Not only for the slain, but those who live.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 167
				-
					-
						I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And sent by fate to share the Latian land.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 170
				-
					-
						My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 171
				-
					-
						Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 172
				-
					-
						His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 173
				-
					-
						My right and his are in dispute: the slain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 175
				-
					-
						In equal arms let us alone contend;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 176
				-
					-
						And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 177
				-
					-
						This is the way (so tell him) to possess
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 178
				-
					-
						The royal virgin, and restore the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 179
				-
					-
						Bear this message back, with ample leave,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 180
				-
					-
						That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 183
				-
					-
						Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 185
				-
					-
						Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 186
				-
					-
						With graceful action bowing, thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 187
				-
					-
						"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 188
				-
					-
						But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 189
				-
					-
						Would I your justice or your force express,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 190
				-
					-
						Thought can but equal; and all words are less.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Your answer we shall thankfully relate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 192
				-
					-
						And favors granted to the Latian state.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 193
				-
					-
						If wish'd success our labor shall attend,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 196
				-
					-
						And seek alliance in some other land:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 197
				-
					-
						Build you the city which your fates assign;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 198
				-
					-
						We shall be proud in the great work to join."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 200
				-
					-
						The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.

				-
					-
						Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 203
				-
					-
						Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 204
				-
					-
						To fell the timber, and forget the war.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 207
				-
					-
						First fall from high; and some the trunks receive
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 208
				-
					-
						In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 209
				-
					-
						And now the fatal news by Fame is blown
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 211
				-
					-
						Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 212
				-
					-
						His triumphs on distended pinions bore.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 213
				-
					-
						Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 214
				-
					-
						Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 216
				-
					-
						The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 217
				-
					-
						That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 218
				-
					-
						The marching troop which their dead prince attends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 220
				-
					-
						The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 221
				-
					-
						And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 222
				-
					-
						The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Forgetful of his state, he runs along,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 225
				-
					-
						With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 226
				-
					-
						Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 227
				-
					-
						With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 228
				-
					-
						Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 229
				-
					-
						A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 230
				-
					-
						"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 231
				-
					-
						To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 232
				-
					-
						I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 233
				-
					-
						What perils youthful ardor would pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 234
				-
					-
						That boiling blood would carry thee too far,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 236
				-
					-
						O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Hard elements of unauspicious war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 239
				-
					-
						Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 240
				-
					-
						Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 242
				-
					-
						Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 243
				-
					-
						To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 244
				-
					-
						Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 245
				-
					-
						My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 246
				-
					-
						If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 247
				-
					-
						Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 248
				-
					-
						(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 249
				-
					-
						A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 250
				-
					-
						Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 251
				-
					-
						Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 252
				-
					-
						'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 253
				-
					-
						But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 254
				-
					-
						Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 255
				-
					-
						At least he led the way to victory:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 256
				-
					-
						First for his friends he won the fatal shore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 257
				-
					-
						And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 258
				-
					-
						A death too great, too glorious to deplore.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 259
				-
					-
						Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 260
				-
					-
						Content with those the Trojan hero gave:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 261
				-
					-
						That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 262
				-
					-
						In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 263
				-
					-
						Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 264
				-
					-
						Then let thy own achievements be thy share.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 265
				-
					-
						Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 266
				-
					-
						Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 267
				-
					-
						If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 268
				-
					-
						Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 269
				-
					-
						But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 270
				-
					-
						These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 271
				-
					-
						Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 272
				-
					-
						Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 273
				-
					-
						And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 274
				-
					-
						'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 275
				-
					-
						I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 276
				-
					-
						Is owing to the living and the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 277
				-
					-
						My son and I expect it from his hand;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 278
				-
					-
						'T is all that he can give, or we demand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 279
				-
					-
						Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 280
				-
					-
						To greet my Pallas with such news below."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 281
				-
					-
						The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 282
				-
					-
						Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 283
				-
					-
						The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 284
				-
					-
						To raise the piles along the winding strand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 285
				-
					-
						Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 286
				-
					-
						Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 287
				-
					-
						The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 288
				-
					-
						Then thrice around the kindled piles they go
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 289
				-
					-
						(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 290
				-
					-
						Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 291
				-
					-
						And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 292
				-
					-
						Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 293
				-
					-
						And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 294
				-
					-
						Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 295
				-
					-
						The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 296
				-
					-
						Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 297
				-
					-
						One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 298
				-
					-
						Some to their fellows their own arms restore:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 299
				-
					-
						The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 300
				-
					-
						Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 301
				-
					-
						And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 302
				-
					-
						Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 303
				-
					-
						And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 304
				-
					-
						Around the piles a careful troop attends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 1: Verse 305
				-
					-
						To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Piles without number for their dead prepare.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Part in the places where they fell are laid;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The corps of kings, and captains of renown,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Borne off in state, are buried in the town;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Trojans and Latians vie with like desires
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To make the field of battle shine with fires,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						When those who round the wasted fires remain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Perform the last sad office to the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						They rake the yet warm ashes from below;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						These relics with their country rites they grace,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 21
				-
					-
						And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 22
				-
					-
						But, in the palace of the king, appears
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 23
				-
					-
						A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 26
				-
					-
						All in that universal sorrow share,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And curse the cause of this unhappy war:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 28
				-
					-
						A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 29
				-
					-
						A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 30
				-
					-
						These are the crimes with which they load the name
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 32
				-
					-
						"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 34
				-
					-
						His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 35
				-
					-
						'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 36
				-
					-
						This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 37
				-
					-
						"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Nor Turnus wants a party, to support
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 39
				-
					-
						His cause and credit in the Latian court.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 40
				-
					-
						His former acts secure his present fame,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And the queen shades him with her mighty name.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 42
				-
					-
						While thus their factious minds with fury burn,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 43
				-
					-
						The legates from th' Aetolian prince return:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 45
				-
					-
						And care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 46
				-
					-
						That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 51
				-
					-
						A foreign son is pointed out by fate;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 53
				-
					-
						The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 55
				-
					-
						When late their titles in the field were tried:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The Latian senate to the council hall.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The princes come, commanded by their head,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 60
				-
					-
						And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 62
				-
					-
						He takes the throne, and in the midst appears.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Majestically sad, he sits in state,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And bids his envoys their success relate.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 65
				-
					-
						When Venulus began, the murmuring sound
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 67

						"We have," said he, "perform'd your high command,

						And pass'd with peril a long tract of land:

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 69
				-
					-
						We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 70
				-
					-
						The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld.

						Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls

				-
					-
						The city, which Argyripa he calls,

				-
					-
						From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy,

				-
					-
						The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 75
				-
					-
						When introduc'd, our presents first we bring,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Then crave an instant audience from the king.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 77
				-
					-
						His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And tell th' important cause for which we came.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 79
				-

						Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;

				-
					-
						Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To change for war hereditary rest,

						A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?

						We- for myself I speak, and all the name

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 89
				-
					-
						Omitting those who were in battle slain,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Or borne by rolling Simois to the main-

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 92
				-
					-
						The prize of honor which in arms he sought;

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n;

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 95
				-
					-
						So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 96
				-
					-
						As ev'n old Priam might with pity view.

						Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led

						Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed,

						In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men

						Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain

						Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?

						Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?

						Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name

				-
					-
						Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 108
				-
					-
						The proud revenger of another's wife,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 111
				-
					-
						The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 112
				-
					-
						The gods have envied me the sweets of life,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 113
				-
					-
						My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 118
				-
					-
						What squalid specters, in the dead of night,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 120
				-
					-
						I might have promis'd to myself those harms,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Such arms this hand shall never more employ;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 125
				-
					-
						No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 126
				-
					-
						I war not with its dust; nor am I glad
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 127
				-
					-
						To think of past events, or good or bad.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Your presents I return: whate'er you bring
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 129
				-
					-
						To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 130
				-
					-
						We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 131
				-
					-
						With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 133
				-
					-
						How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 135
				-
					-
						They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 138
				-
					-
						The long defense the Trojan people made,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 139
				-
					-
						The war protracted, and the siege delay'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 141
				-
					-
						Both brave alike, and equal in command;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 142
				-
					-
						Aeneas, not inferior in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 143
				-
					-
						In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Th' impending dangers of a fatal war.'
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 146
				-
					-
						He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 147
				-
					-
						Refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Thus Venulus concluded his report.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 149
				-
					-
						A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 150
				-
					-
						As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 151
				-
					-
						And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 152
				-
					-
						The flood, constrain'd within a scanty space,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Roars horrible along th' uneasy race;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 154
				-
					-
						White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 155
				-
					-
						The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 156
				-
					-
						The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 157
				-
					-
						The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 158
				-
					-
						"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Had been resolv'd before it was too late.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Much better had it been for you and me,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 161
				-
					-
						Unforc'd by this our last necessity,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 162
				-
					-
						To have been earlier wise, than now to call
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 163
				-
					-
						A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 164
				-
					-
						O citizens, we wage unequal war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 165
				-
					-
						With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 166
				-
					-
						But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 167
				-
					-
						Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 168
				-
					-
						What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Our hopes must center on ourselves alone.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 171
				-
					-
						You see too well; nor need my words explain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Factions within, a foe without the gate!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 175
				-
					-
						With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 176
				-
					-
						With our united strength the war we wag'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 177
				-
					-
						With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 178
				-
					-
						You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 179
				-
					-
						To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 180
				-
					-
						A tract of land the Latins have possess'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 183
				-
					-
						And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 185
				-
					-
						If you consent, the Trojan shall command,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 187
				-
					-
						On terms agreed, the common country share.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 188
				-
					-
						There let'em build and settle, if they please;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 189
				-
					-
						Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 190
				-
					-
						In search of seats remote from Italy,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 191
				-
					-
						And from unwelcome inmates set us free.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 193
				-
					-
						Or twice as many more, if more they need.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 195
				-
					-
						Runs equal with the margin of the flood:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 196
				-
					-
						Let them the number and the form assign;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 197
				-
					-
						The care and cost of all the stores be mine.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 198
				-
					-
						To treat the peace, a hundred senators
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 200
				-
					-
						With olive the presents they shall bear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 201
				-
					-
						A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 202
				-
					-
						And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 203
				-
					-
						And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 204
				-
					-
						This great affair, and save the sinking state."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 206
				-
					-
						The rising glories of the Daunian prince.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Factious and rich, bold at the council board,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 208
				-
					-
						But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 209
				-
					-
						A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Noble his mother was, and near the throne;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 211
				-
					-
						But, what his father's parentage, unknown.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 212
				-
					-
						He rose, and took th' advantage of the times,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 213
				-
					-
						To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 214
				-
					-
						"Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 215
				-
					-
						As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 216
				-
					-
						Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 217
				-
					-
						What common needs require, but fear to speak.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 218
				-
					-
						Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 219
				-
					-
						Whose pride this unauspicious war began;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 220
				-
					-
						For whose ambition (let me dare to say,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 222
				-
					-
						The plains of Latium run with blood around.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 223
				-
					-
						So many valiant heroes bite the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 225
				-
					-
						A town in mourning, and a land in tears;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 226
				-
					-
						While he, th' undoubted author of our harms,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 227
				-
					-
						The man who menaces the gods with arms,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 228
				-
					-
						Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 229
				-
					-
						And sought his safety in ignoble flight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 230
				-
					-
						Now, best of kings, since you propose to send
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 231
				-
					-
						Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Add yet a greater at our joint request,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 233
				-
					-
						One which he values more than all the rest:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 234
				-
					-
						Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 235
				-
					-
						With that alliance let the league be tied,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 236
				-
					-
						And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Let insolence no longer awe the throne;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 238

						For this maligner of the general good,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 240
				-
					-
						If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 241

					-
						His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 242

						O cursed cause of all our ills, must we

						Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 245
				-
					-
						What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 246
				-
					-
						And send us out to meet our certain fate?

						'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand

						Our peace and public safety we demand.

						Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 250

						If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.

						Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 252
				-
					-
						Nor will I much with your belief contend:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 253
				-
					-
						I beg your greatness not to give the law

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 254

						In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.

				-
					-
						Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 257
				-
					-
						Your interest is, the war should never cease;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 258
				-
					-
						But we have felt enough to wish the peace:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 259
				-
					-
						A land exhausted to the last remains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 260

					-
						Depopulated towns, and driven plains.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 261

						Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r,

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 262
				-
					-
						A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 263
				-
					-
						So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 264
				-

						And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.
					-
				-

						Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;

					-
						We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:

						A base ignoble crowd, without a name,

						Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 272
				-
					-
						Should share such triumphs, and detain from you

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 273
				-

						The post of honor, your undoubted due.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 274
				-
					-
						Rather alone your matchless force employ,

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 275
				-
					-
						To merit what alone you must enjoy."

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 276
				-
					-
						These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 277

						Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.

						Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,

				-
					-
						"You, Drances, never want a stream of words,

						Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand,

						If any doubt remains, who dares the most,

				-
					-
						Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost,

						Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,

					-
						And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.

						I beaten from the field? I forc'd away?

					-
						What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,

						The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,

				-
					-
						I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 307
				-
					-
						Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 308
				-
					-
						I singly their united arms oppos'd:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 309

					-
						First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;

						The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 388
				-
					-
						Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;

					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 389
				-
					-
						A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 390
				-
					-
						Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,

				-

						"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 410
				-
					-
						Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 411
				-
					-
						To break the treaty for the promis'd bride.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 412
				-
					-
						Some help to sink new trenches; others aid
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 413
				-
					-
						To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 414
				-
					-
						Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 415
				-
					-
						Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 416
				-
					-
						A sad procession in the streets is seen,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 417
				-
					-
						Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 418
				-
					-
						High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 419
				-
					-
						With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 420
				-
					-
						They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 421
				-
					-
						Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 422
				-
					-
						With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 423
				-
					-
						Then in this common supplication join:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 424
				-
					-
						"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 425
				-
					-
						Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 426
				-
					-
						Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 427
				-
					-
						And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 428
				-
					-
						Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 429
				-
					-
						Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 430
				-
					-
						The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 431
				-
					-
						Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 432
				-
					-
						His faithful fauchion sits upon his side;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 433
				-
					-
						Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 434
				-
					-
						But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 435
				-
					-
						With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 436
				-
					-
						Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 437
				-
					-
						His absent rival, and to promise war.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 438
				-
					-
						Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 439
				-
					-
						The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 440
				-
					-
						Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 441
				-
					-
						And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 442
				-
					-
						Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 443
				-
					-
						To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 444
				-
					-
						He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 445
				-
					-
						And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 446
				-
					-
						He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 447
				-
					-
						Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 448
				-
					-
						Soon as the prince appears without the gate,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 449
				-
					-
						The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 450
				-
					-
						His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 451
				-
					-
						Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 452
				-
					-
						Her squadron imitates, and each descends;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 453
				-
					-
						Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 454
				-
					-
						"If sense of honor, if a soul secure
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 455
				-
					-
						Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 456
				-
					-
						Can promise aught, or on itself rely
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 457
				-
					-
						Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 458
				-
					-
						Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 459
				-
					-
						The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 460
				-
					-
						Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 461
				-
					-
						You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:"
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 462
				-
					-
						Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 463
				-
					-
						And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 464
				-
					-
						Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 465
				-
					-
						With what becoming thanks can I reply?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 466
				-
					-
						Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 467
				-
					-
						But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 468
				-
					-
						Yet rob me not of all; but let me join
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 469
				-
					-
						My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 470
				-
					-
						The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 471
				-
					-
						Sends his light horse before to scour the field:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 472
				-
					-
						Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 473
				-
					-
						A larger compass to the city takes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 474
				-
					-
						This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 475
				-
					-
						To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 476
				-
					-
						With chosen foot his passage to forelay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 477
				-
					-
						And place an ambush in the winding way.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 478
				-
					-
						Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 479
				-
					-
						The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 480
				-
					-
						With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 481
				-
					-
						Subjected all to thy supreme command."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 482
				-
					-
						This said, he warns Messapus to the war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 483
				-
					-
						Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 484
				-
					-
						All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 485
				-
					-
						And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 486
				-
					-
						Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 487
				-
					-
						By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 488
				-
					-
						A narrow track, by human steps untrode,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 489
				-
					-
						Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 490
				-
					-
						High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 491
				-
					-
						Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 492
				-
					-
						The top is level, an offensive seat
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 493
				-
					-
						Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 494
				-
					-
						For, on the right and left, is room to press
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 495
				-
					-
						The foes at hand, or from afar distress;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 496
				-
					-
						To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 497
				-
					-
						On their descending backs a stony show'r.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 498
				-
					-
						Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 499
				-
					-
						Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 500
				-
					-
						Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 501
				-
					-
						Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 502
				-
					-
						And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 503
				-
					-
						Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 504
				-
					-
						Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 505
				-
					-
						To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 506
				-
					-
						The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 507
				-
					-
						Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 508
				-
					-
						Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 509
				-
					-
						'T was born with her; and with her years it grew.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 510
				-
					-
						Her father Metabus, when forc'd away
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 511
				-
					-
						From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 512
				-
					-
						Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 513
				-
					-
						This tender babe, companion of his woes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 514
				-
					-
						Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 515
				-
					-
						One hissing letter in a softer sound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 516
				-
					-
						And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 517
				-
					-
						Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 518
				-
					-
						His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 519
				-
					-
						With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 520
				-
					-
						The banks of Amasene at length he gains:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 521
				-
					-
						The raging flood his farther flight restrains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 522
				-
					-
						Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 523
				-
					-
						Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 524
				-
					-
						Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 525
				-
					-
						Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 526
				-
					-
						Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 527
				-
					-
						A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 528
				-
					-
						The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 529
				-
					-
						He clos'd the child within the hollow space;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 530
				-
					-
						With twigs of bending osier bound the case;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 531
				-
					-
						Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 532
				-
					-
						And thus invok'd my favor for the freight:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 533
				-
					-
						'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 534
				-
					-
						'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 535
				-
					-
						Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 536
				-
					-
						And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 537
				-
					-
						He said; and with full force the spear he threw:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 538
				-
					-
						Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 539
				-
					-
						Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 540
				-
					-
						And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 541
				-
					-
						His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 542
				-
					-
						And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 543
				-
					-
						Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 544
				-
					-
						Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 545
				-
					-
						But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 546
				-
					-
						Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 547
				-
					-
						On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 548
				-
					-
						He shunn'd the dire society of men.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 549
				-
					-
						A shepherd's solitary life he led;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 550
				-
					-
						His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 551
				-
					-
						The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 552
				-
					-
						He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 553
				-
					-
						The little Amazon could scarcely go:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 554
				-
					-
						He loads her with a quiver and a bow;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 555
				-
					-
						And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 556
				-
					-
						He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 557
				-
					-
						Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 558
				-
					-
						Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 559
				-
					-
						Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 560
				-
					-
						Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 561
				-
					-
						The flying dart she first attempts to fling,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 562
				-
					-
						And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 563
				-
					-
						Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 564
				-
					-
						To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 565
				-
					-
						And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 566
				-
					-
						The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 567
				-
					-
						To bless their rival sons with such a bride;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 568
				-
					-
						But she disdains their love, to share with me
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 569
				-
					-
						The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 570
				-
					-
						And, O! I wish, contented with my cares
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 571
				-
					-
						Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 572
				-
					-
						Then had she been of my celestial train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 573
				-
					-
						And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 574
				-
					-
						But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 575
				-
					-
						To find her death among forbidden foes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 576
				-
					-
						Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 577
				-
					-
						Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 578
				-
					-
						This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 579
				-
					-
						This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 580
				-
					-
						By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 581
				-
					-
						Or of the Trojan or Italian train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 582
				-
					-
						Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 583
				-
					-
						Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 584
				-
					-
						To bear the breathless body of my maid:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 585
				-
					-
						Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 586
				-
					-
						Her holy limbs with any human hand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 587
				-
					-
						And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 588
				-
					-
						She said. The faithful nymph descends from high
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 589
				-
					-
						With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 590
				-
					-
						Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 591
				-
					-
						By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 592
				-
					-
						Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 593
				-
					-
						Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 594
				-
					-
						Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 595
				-
					-
						Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 596
				-
					-
						And the fields glitter with a waving war.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 597
				-
					-
						Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 598
				-
					-
						Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 599
				-
					-
						These in the body plac'd, on either hand
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 600
				-
					-
						Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 601
				-
					-
						Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 602
				-
					-
						And less and less the middle space appears.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 603
				-
					-
						Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 604
				-
					-
						The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 605
				-
					-
						In distance of their darts they stop their course;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 606
				-
					-
						Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 607
				-
					-
						The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 608
				-
					-
						And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 609
				-
					-
						Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 610
				-
					-
						By mettled coursers borne in full career,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 611
				-
					-
						Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 612
				-
					-
						Their horses' heads against each other knock.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 613
				-
					-
						Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 614
				-
					-
						As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 615
				-
					-
						He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 616
				-
					-
						The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 2: Verse 617
				-
					-
						And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						And far upon the beach eject the sand;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Orsilochus, who durst not press too near
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						But shaded with a length of yellow hair:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And death with honor sought on either side.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						One side was bare for her exerted breast;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						In war, the bold companions of the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Such to the field Penthisilea led,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						With such, return'd triumphant from the war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						They clash with manly force their moony shields;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						A purple stream came spouting from the wound;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Amastrus next is added to the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Him soon she singled from the flying train,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						A woman warrior was too strong for thee.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						And o'er the shield which his left side defends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Orsilochus and she their courses ply:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						But in a narrower ring she makes the race;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						She swings her ax, and rises to the blow
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Full on the helm behind, with such a sway
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						(At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own?
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 107
				-
					-
						And then on equal terms begin the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 108
				-
					-
						It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 109
				-
					-
						When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 110
				-
					-
						He said. She glows with anger and disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And leaves her horse at large among her train;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 113
				-
					-
						With her drawn sword defies him to the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 115
				-
					-
						The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 118
				-
					-
						The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 119
				-
					-
						"Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 120
				-
					-

				-
					-
						Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts

					-
						Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,

				-
					-
						With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 125
				-
					-
						At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 126
				-
					-
						That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 128
				-
					-
						And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.
					-
				-

				-
					-
						Not with more ease the falcon, from above,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 4: Verse 132
				-

						The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.

						Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,

				-
					-
						With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 5

						Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,

						And these encourages, and those he chides;

						Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 8

						"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame,

						Cowards incurable, a woman's hand

						Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band!

					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 15

						Not thus you fly your female foes by night,

				-
					-
						Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 17

						When to fat off'rings the glad augur calls,

					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Not managing the life he meant to lose.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist;

					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,
					-
				-

				-
					-
						And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 29

						The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Nor less the captive struggles for his life:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						He writhes his body to prolong the strife,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						His utmost vigor, and the point averts.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Against the victor, all defense is weak:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The Latins, and presume the like success.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This way and that his winding course he bends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						When she retires victorious from the chase,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						He wheels about with care, and shifts his place;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 19

					-
						Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						A golden helm his front and head surrounds
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Or that the temple might his trophies hold,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And seeks his life, regardless of her own.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						"O patron of Socrates' high abodes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine;

				-
					-
						By thee protected with our naked soles,

						Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The stains of this dishonorable day:

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						But with my future actions trust my fame.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And from the field return inglorious home."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 9
				-
					-
						He gives the death desir'd; his safe return
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By southern tempests to the seas is borne.

					-
						Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Directed by the sound. Of either host,

				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 16
				-
					-
						On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Till in her pap the winged weapon stood
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Her sad attendants hasten to sustain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 21
				-
					-
						Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 22
				-
					-
						With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 25
				-
					-
						As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 26
				-
					-
						At unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 29
				-
					-
						So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 30
				-
					-
						But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 31
				-
					-
						She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 32
				-
					-
						But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The wood she draws, the steely point remains;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 34
				-
					-
						She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 35
				-
					-
						(A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 37
				-
					-
						Then turns to her, whom of her female train
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 38
				-
					-
						She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 39
				-
					-
						"Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Inexorable Death; and claims his right.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And bid him timely to my charge succeed,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 45
				-
					-
						She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Her mind the passage from her body frees.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 49
				-
					-
						She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Her drooping head declining on her breast:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 51
				-
					-
						In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 53
				-
					-
						A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 55
				-
					-
						The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 57
				-
					-
						But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 7: Verse 61
				-
					-
						And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.
					-
			-
				Book 11: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid!
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Her vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						But after ages shall thy praise record.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A king that once in Latium bore the sway.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And say I sent thee to the shades below,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						She said, and from her quiver chose with speed
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						At once the twanging bow and sounding dart
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						The conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						The welcome message to her mistress brings.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						More on their speed than on their strength rely.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And spur their horses headlong to the town.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 46
				-
					-
						These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 52
				-
					-
						The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 54
				-
					-
						All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Some happy few escape: the throng too late
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 61
				-
					-
						But leave their friends excluded with their foes.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 62
				-
					-
						The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 63
				-
					-
						'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 66
				-
					-
						The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 68
				-
					-
						So much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 69
				-
					-
						So much Camilla's great example fir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 71
				-
					-
						With imitated darts, to gall the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 73
				-
					-
						And crowd each other to be first in death.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 75
				-
					-
						With heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 76
				-
					-
						"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 77
				-
					-
						The foes, entirely masters of the field,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 79
				-
					-
						The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 80
				-
					-
						Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 81
				-
					-
						The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,)
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 82
				-
					-
						He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 85
				-
					-
						From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Unknowingly secure, their way they take;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 88
				-
					-
						From the rough mountains to the plain descend,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And there, in order drawn, their line extend.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Both armies now in open fields are seen;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Nor far the distance of the space between.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 94
				-
					-
						And Turnus views the Trojans in array,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd;
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 97
				-
					-
						But westward to the sea the sun declin'd.
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Intrench'd before the town both armies lie,
					-
				-
					Book 11: Stanza 8: Verse 99
				-
					-
						While Night with sable wings involves the sky.

			Book 12

				Book 12: Stanza 1
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 1
				-
					-
						When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Himself become the mark of public spite,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The more his fury boil'd within his breast:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He rous'd his vigor for the last debate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 9
				-
					-
						As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 10
				-
					-
						He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 11
				-
					-
						But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The lordly beast returns with double pride:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 13
				-
					-
						He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 14
				-
					-
						His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 15
				-
					-
						So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 18
				-
					-
						At length approach'd the king, and thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 19
				-
					-
						"No more excuses or delays: I stand
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 20
				-
					-
						In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 21
				-
					-
						This base deserter of his native land.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The same conditions which himself did make.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And to my single virtue trust the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This arm unaided shall assert your right:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 29
				-
					-
						To him the crown and beauteous bride remain."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To whom the king sedately thus replied:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 31
				-
					-
						"Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 32
				-
					-
						The more becomes it us, with due respect,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 33
				-
					-
						To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 34
				-
					-
						You want not wealth, or a successive throne,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Or cities which your arms have made your own:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 36
				-
					-
						My towns and treasures are at your command,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Unmarried, fair, of noble families.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 42
				-
					-
						But sound advice, proceeding from a heart
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 44
				-
					-
						The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 45
				-
					-
						No prince Italian born should heir my throne:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 51
				-
					-
						I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Her from her plighted lord by force I took;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 53
				-
					-
						All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 54
				-
					-
						On your account I wag'd an impious war-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 55
				-
					-
						With what success, 't is needless to declare;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 56
				-
					-
						I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 60
				-
					-
						The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Why put I not an end to this debate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 63
				-
					-
						If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Why should I not procure it whilst you live?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 66
				-
					-
						What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 68
				-
					-
						How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 69
				-
					-
						The daughter's lover and the father's friend?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 75
				-
					-
						With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 76
				-
					-
						"The care, O best of fathers, which you take
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 77
				-
					-
						For my concerns, at my desire forsake.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Permit me not to languish out my days,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 79
				-
					-
						But make the best exchange of life for praise.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 80
				-
					-
						This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 81
				-
					-
						And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 82
				-
					-
						His goddess mother is not near, to shroud
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 83
				-
					-
						The flying coward with an empty cloud."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 84
				-
					-
						But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 85
				-
					-
						And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Held him by force; and, dying in his death,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 87
				-
					-
						In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 88
				-
					-
						"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And whate'er price Amata's honor bears
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 90
				-
					-
						Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 91
				-
					-
						My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Since on the safety of thy life alone
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 95
				-
					-
						To waive the combat, and pursue the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 98
				-
					-
						I cannot live a slave, or see my throne
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 100
				-
					-
						At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 101
				-
					-
						A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 103
				-
					-
						The driving colors, never at a stay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 105
				-
					-
						Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 107
				-
					-
						Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 108
				-
					-
						The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 109
				-
					-
						The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 114
				-
					-
						"O mother, do not by your tears prepare
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 117
				-
					-
						To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 119
				-
					-
						"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 122
				-
					-
						The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 125
				-
					-
						And to the victor be the beauteous bride."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 126
				-
					-
						He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 127
				-
					-
						He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 128
				-
					-
						At his approach they toss their heads on high,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 129
				-
					-
						And, proudly neighing, promise victory.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 130
				-
					-
						The sires of these Orythia sent from far,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 131
				-
					-
						To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 132
				-
					-
						The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Officious grooms stand ready by his side;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 135
				-
					-
						And some with combs their flowing manes divide,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 1: Verse 136
				-
					-
						And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 2
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 1
				-
					-
						He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And girt his faithful fauchion to his side.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 5
				-
					-
						In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 6
				-
					-
						That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 14
				-
					-
						And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 16
				-
					-
						Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 2: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!"
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 3
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 2
				-
					-
						A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 3
				-
					-
						So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 5
				-
					-
						He tries his goring horns against a tree,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And meditates his absent enemy;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To future fight his manly courage warms:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 11
				-
					-
						He whets his fury, and with joy prepares
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 12
				-
					-
						To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 13
				-
					-
						To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 14
				-
					-
						What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 20
				-
					-
						From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 21
				-
					-
						When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 22
				-
					-
						In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Beneath the walls they measure out the space;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Where, with religious their common gods they place.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 26
				-
					-
						In purest white the priests their heads attire;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 27
				-
					-
						And living waters bear, and holy fire;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 30
				-
					-
						In order issuing from the town appears
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And from the fields, advancing on a line,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 33
				-
					-
						The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 3: Verse 35
				-
					-
						A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 4
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And there Messapus, born of seed divine.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Each man in order fills his proper place.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 8
				-
					-
						And fix their pointed lances in the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 14
				-
					-
						With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 15
				-
					-
						(Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 16
				-
					-
						But then an empty hill, without a name).
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 17
				-
					-
						She thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 21
				-
					-
						King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Compress'd by force, but, by the grateful god,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 25
				-
					-
						"O nymph, the pride of living lakes," said she,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 26
				-
					-
						"O most renown'd, and most belov'd by me,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 28
				-
					-
						The wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To mount by stealth my violated bed,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 31
				-
					-
						To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 32
				-
					-
						But gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 35
				-
					-
						While fortune favor'd, nor Heav'n's King denied
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 36
				-
					-
						To lend my succor to the Latian side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 37
				-
					-
						I sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 38
				-
					-
						But now he struggles with unequal fate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 40
				-
					-
						To meet inevitable death in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Thou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 43
				-
					-
						It well becomes a sister's care to try."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 44
				-
					-
						At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 46
				-
					-
						To whom Saturnia thus: "Thy tears are late:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 48
				-
					-
						New tumults kindle; violate the truce:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Who knows what changeful fortune may produce?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 50
				-
					-
						'T is not a crime t' attempt what I decree;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 52
				-
					-
						She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Twelve golden beams around his temples play,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 57
				-
					-
						To mark his lineage from the God of Day.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And in his hand two massy spears he shook:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Aeneas, author of the Roman line;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And by his side Ascanius took his place,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The second hope of Rome's immortal race.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears,

						And off'rings to the flaming altars bears;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 66
				-
					-
						A porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 68
				-
					-
						And strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 69
				-
					-
						With salt and meal: with like officious care
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 70
				-
					-
						He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 72
				-
					-
						With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 74
				-
					-
						And thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 75
				-
					-
						"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 76
				-
					-
						For which I have sustain'd so long a toil,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Thou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The labors and events of arms obey;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 82
				-
					-
						All pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 85
				-
					-
						My Trojans shall encrease Evander's town;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Ascanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 87
				-
					-
						All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 89
				-
					-
						But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 90
				-
					-
						(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 91
				-
					-
						My Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Both equal, both unconquer'd shall remain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Join'd in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 94
				-
					-
						I ask but altars for my weary gods.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The care of those religious rites be mine;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The crown to King Latinus I resign:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 97
				-
					-
						His be the sov'reign sway. Nor will I share
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 98
				-
					-
						His pow'r in peace, or his command in war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 99
				-
					-
						For me, my friends another town shall frame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 100
				-
					-
						And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's name."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 102
				-
					-
						The Latian king before his altar stands.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 103
				-
					-
						"By the same heav'n," said he, "and earth, and main,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 104
				-
					-
						And all the pow'rs that all the three contain;

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 105
				-
					-
						By hell below, and by that upper god
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 4: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 5
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So let Latona's double offspring hear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 3
				-
					-
						I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 4
				-
					-
						And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Whatever chance befall on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 6
				-
					-
						No term of time this union shall divide:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 7
				-
					-
						No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Not tho' the circling seas should break their bound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 10
				-
					-
						O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Ev'n as this royal scepter" (for he bore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 14
				-
					-
						A scepter in his hand) "shall never more
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 16
				-
					-
						An orphan now, cut from the mother earth
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 17
				-
					-
						By the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And cas'd in brass, for Latian kings to bear."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 19
				-
					-
						When thus in public view the peace was tied
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 21
				-
					-
						All dues perform'd which holy rites require;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 22
				-
					-
						The victim beasts are slain before the fire,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 23
				-
					-
						The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Already the Rutulians deem their man
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 26
				-
					-
						O'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 27
				-
					-
						First rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 31
				-
					-
						The nearer they approach, the more is known
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Th' apparent disadvantage of their own.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Turnus himself appears in public sight
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 36
				-
					-
						With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 38
				-
					-
						A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 39
				-
					-
						With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 41
				-
					-
						When their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And found their ready minds for change prepar'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Dissembling her immortal form, she took
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 45
				-
					-
						A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Was his great sire, and he his greater son.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 47
				-
					-
						His shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And humoring their first motions, thus began:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 49
				-
					-
						"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Of one expos'd for all, in single fight?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 51
				-
					-
						Can we, before the face of heav'n, confess
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Our courage colder, or our numbers less?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 53
				-
					-
						View all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 54
				-
					-
						And Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Undaunted to the battle if we go,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Shall lose, with honor, his devoted life,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Or change it rather for immortal fame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 61
				-
					-
						But you, a servile and inglorious band,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 62
				-
					-
						For foreign lords shall sow your native land,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 65
				-
					-
						With words like these, she carried her design:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 66
				-
					-
						A rising murmur runs along the line.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 68
				-
					-
						With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Their champion's fate with pity they lament,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 72
				-
					-
						With lying wonders, and a false presage;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 73
				-
					-
						But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 75
				-
					-
						For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 76
				-
					-
						Appears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 77
				-
					-
						A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 80
				-
					-
						In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Th' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 82
				-
					-
						But, while he lags, and labors in his flight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 83
				-
					-
						Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 84
				-
					-
						And with united force the foe pursue:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 87
				-
					-
						They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 89
				-
					-
						But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 90
				-
					-
						And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Eager of action, and demand the fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 95
				-
					-
						"At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 96
				-
					-
						This, this is what my frequent vows requir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 99
				-
					-
						These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 101
				-
					-
						But soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 102
				-
					-
						By strength united, and forego the prey.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Your timely succor to your country bring,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 104
				-
					-
						Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 105
				-
					-
						He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 106
				-
					-
						Pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 109
				-
					-
						At once the cornel rattled in the skies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 110
				-
					-
						At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Gylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 115
				-
					-
						A passage thro' the jointed arms it found,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Just where the belt was to the body bound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 117
				-
					-
						And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 119
				-
					-
						Run madly forward to revenge the slain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 120
				-
					-
						And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And some with sword in hand assault the foe.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 122
				-
					-
						The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 123
				-
					-
						And meet their ardor in the middle space.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 124
				-
					-
						The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 125
				-
					-
						With equal courage obviate their design.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Both armies urges to their mutual fate.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 128
				-
					-
						With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 129
				-
					-
						The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Thick storms of steel from either army fly,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 131
				-
					-
						And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 133
				-
					-
						With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 134
				-
					-
						Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 135
				-
					-
						And bears his unregarded gods away.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 136
				-
					-
						These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 137
				-
					-
						The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Messapus, eager to confound the peace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 140
				-
					-
						At King Aulestes, by his purple known
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 141
				-
					-
						A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 142
				-
					-
						And, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 143
				-
					-
						Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 144
				-
					-
						The ruins of an altar were behind:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 145
				-
					-
						There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 146
				-
					-
						Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 147
				-
					-
						The beamy spear, descending from above,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 148
				-
					-
						His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 150
				-
					-
						"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 151
				-
					-
						Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Of his rich armor, and uncrown his head.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 153
				-
					-
						Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 154
				-
					-
						From his own altar, with a blazing brand;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Advanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 157
				-
					-
						His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 158
				-
					-
						The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 160
				-
					-
						With his left hand; his other cast him down.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 161
				-
					-
						The prostrate body with his knees he press'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 162
				-
					-
						And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 163
				-
					-
						While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 164
				-
					-
						The shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 166
				-
					-
						Full on the front of his unwary foe.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 167
				-
					-
						The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 168
				-
					-
						And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 169
				-
					-
						Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 170
				-
					-
						An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 171
				-
					-
						And seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 172
				-
					-
						But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 174
				-
					-
						In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 175
				-
					-
						"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Inflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 177
				-
					-
						From impious arms, nor violate the peace!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 178
				-
					-
						By human sanctions, and by laws divine,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 179
				-
					-
						The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 180
				-
					-
						Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 181
				-
					-
						This hand alone shall right the gods and you:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Our injur'd altars, and their broken vow,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 183
				-
					-
						To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 184
				-
					-
						Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 185
				-
					-
						A winged arrow struck the pious prince.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 186
				-
					-
						But, whether from some human hand it came,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 187
				-
					-
						Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 188
				-
					-
						No human hand or hostile god was found,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 189
				-
					-
						To boast the triumph of so base a wound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 190
				-
					-
						When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 191
				-
					-
						His chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 192
				-
					-
						Th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 193
				-
					-
						At once his arms and coursers he requires;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 194
				-
					-
						Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 195
				-
					-
						And with a ready hand assumes the reins.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 196
				-
					-
						He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 197
				-
					-
						He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 198
				-
					-
						These his lance reaches; over those he rolls
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 199
				-
					-
						His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 200
				-
					-
						In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 201
				-
					-
						The dead men's weapons at their living friends.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 203
				-
					-
						The God of Battles, in his angry mood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 204
				-
					-
						Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 209
				-
					-
						(Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 210
				-
					-
						Friends of the god, and followers of the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 211
				-
					-
						With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 213
				-
					-
						His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 214
				-
					-
						He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 216
				-
					-
						The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 218
				-
					-
						He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 219
				-
					-
						From far the sons of Imbracus he slew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 221
				-
					-
						Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 224
				-
					-
						New fir'd the Trojans, and their foes repell'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 225
				-
					-
						This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 226
				-
					-
						But emulated more his father's fame;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 227
				-
					-
						His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 228
				-
					-
						The Grecian camp and order to descry:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 229
				-
					-
						Hard enterprise! and well he might require
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 230
				-
					-
						Achilles' car and horses, for his hire:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 231
				-
					-
						But, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 232
				-
					-
						In death bestow'd a juster recompense.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 234
				-
					-
						And launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 236
				-
					-
						And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 237
				-
					-
						Wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 238
				-
					-
						And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 239
				-
					-
						"Possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 240
				-
					-
						And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 241
				-
					-
						Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 5: Verse 242
				-
					-
						Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 6
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 3
				-
					-
						As when loud Boreas, with his blust'ring train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 6
				-
					-
						And rolls the billows on th' Aegaean shore:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 7
				-
					-
						So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 8
				-
					-
						The scatter'd squadrons bend before his force;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 9
				-
					-
						His crest of horses' hair is blown behind
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 10
				-
					-
						By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 11
				-
					-
						This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And, as the chariot roll'd along the plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 17
				-
					-
						And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 18
				-
					-
						And only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 20
				-
					-
						Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 21
				-
					-
						The chariot bore him backward on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 22
				-
					-
						He lies revers'd; the victor king descends,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 24
				-
					-
						He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 25
				-
					-
						With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 26
				-
					-
						While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 29
				-
					-
						And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 31
				-
					-
						His limbs from earth, supported on his spear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 33
				-
					-
						He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 34
				-
					-
						The steel remains. No readier way he found
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 35
				-
					-
						To draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Eager of fight, impatient of delay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 37
				-
					-
						He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Iapis was at hand to prove his art,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 40
				-
					-
						That, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 41
				-
					-
						His tuneful harp and his unerring bow.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The pious youth, more studious how to save
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 43
				-
					-
						His aged sire, now sinking to the grave,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 47
				-
					-
						And heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 48
				-
					-
						The fam'd physician tucks his robes around
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 49
				-
					-
						With ready hands, and hastens to the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 50
				-
					-
						With gentle touches he performs his part,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 51
				-
					-
						This way and that, soliciting the dart,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 52
				-
					-
						And exercises all his heav'nly art.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 53
				-
					-
						All soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 54
				-
					-
						He presses out, and pours their noble juice.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 55
				-
					-
						These first infus'd, to lenify the pain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 56
				-
					-
						He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 57
				-
					-
						Then to the patron of his art he pray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The patron of his art refus'd his aid.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Meantime the war approaches to the tents;
					-

					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The driving dust proclaims the danger near;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And first their friends, and then their foes appear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 63
				-
					-
						Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 64
				-
					-
						The camp is fill'd with terror and affright:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 65
				-
					-
						The hissing shafts within the trench alight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 66
				-
					-
						An undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 67
				-
					-
						The shouts those who kill, and groans of those who die.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 68
				-
					-
						But now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 70
				-
					-
						A branch of healing dittany she brought,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 6: Verse 73
				-
					-
						The leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 7
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 2
				-
					-
						To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 3
				-
					-
						This Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And pours it in a bowl, already crown'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 7: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 8
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The leech, unknowing of superior art
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And in a moment ceas'd the raging smart.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 5
				-
					-
						The steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Moves up, and follows of its own accord,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 7
				-
					-
						And health and vigor are at once restor'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 9
				-
					-
						And first the footsteps of a god he found.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 10
				-
					-
						"Arms! arms!" he cries; "the sword and shield prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 11
				-
					-
						And send the willing chief, renew'd, to war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 12
				-
					-
						This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Some god our general to the battle sends;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Some god preserves his life for greater ends."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The hero arms in haste; his hands infold
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 17
				-
					-
						His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Inflam'd to fight, and rushing to the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 19
				-
					-
						That hand sustaining the celestial shield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 20
				-
					-
						This gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 21
				-
					-
						That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 23
				-
					-
						And, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 24
				-
					-
						"My son, from my example learn the war,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 25
				-
					-
						In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 26
				-
					-
						But happier chance than mine attend thy care!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 27
				-
					-
						This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And crown with honors of the conquer'd field:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 30
				-
					-
						To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 32
				-
					-
						For Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 33
				-
					-
						He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 37
				-
					-
						A cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 39
				-
					-
						Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Beheld the progress of the moving war:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 41
				-
					-
						With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 42
				-
					-
						And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 44
				-
					-
						And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 47
				-
					-
						As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 48
				-
					-
						From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 49
				-
					-
						The painful hind with heavy heart foresees
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 50
				-
					-
						The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 51
				-
					-
						With like impetuous rage the prince appears
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And now both armies shock in open field;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 56
				-
					-
						(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 57
				-
					-
						By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The fatal augur falls, by whose command
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 59
				-
					-
						The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 60
				-
					-
						With Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 62
				-
					-
						And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 63
				-
					-
						The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 66
				-
					-
						He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 67
				-
					-
						Juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 70
				-
					-
						And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 71
				-
					-
						As the black swallow near the palace plies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 72
				-
					-
						O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 74
				-
					-
						To furnish her loquacious nest with food:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 75
				-
					-
						So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The smoking horses run with loosen'd reins.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 77
				-
					-
						She steers a various course among the foes;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Now here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 80
				-
					-
						She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 82
				-
					-
						And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 83
				-
					-
						He runs within a narrower ring, and tries
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 84
				-
					-
						To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 85
				-
					-
						If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 86
				-
					-
						And far away the Daunian hero bears.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 87
				-
					-
						What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 88
				-
					-
						And various cares in vain his mind assail.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 89
				-
					-
						The great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 90
				-
					-
						In his left hand two pointed jav'lins held:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 92
				-
					-
						And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 95
				-
					-
						The weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 96
				-
					-
						The waving plume which on his helm he wore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Forced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 98
				-
					-
						That flying Turnus still declin'd the fight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 99
				-
					-
						The Prince, whose piety had long repell'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 100
				-
					-
						His inborn ardor, now invades the field;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 102
				-
					-
						Their rites and injur'd altars to redress;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 103
				-
					-
						Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 104
				-
					-
						With blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 105
				-
					-
						What god can tell, what numbers can display,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The various labors of that fatal day;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 107
				-
					-
						What chiefs and champions fell on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 108
				-
					-
						In combat slain, or by what deaths they died;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 110
				-
					-
						Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 113
				-
					-
						Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 114
				-
					-
						Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 115
				-
					-
						Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 117
				-
					-
						It reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 118
				-
					-
						Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 119
				-
					-
						First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 121
				-
					-
						Diores, and in equal fight prevail'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 122
				-
					-
						Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 123
				-
					-
						Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 124
				-
					-
						Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 125
				-
					-
						Whom without respite at one charge he slew:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 127
				-
					-
						And sad Onythes, added to the rest,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 128
				-
					-
						Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 129
				-
					-
						Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 130
				-
					-
						And from Apollo's fane to battle sent,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 131
				-
					-
						O'erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 132
				-
					-
						Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 133
				-
					-
						Who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 134
				-
					-
						On Lerna's lake a silent life he led,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 135
				-
					-
						And with his nets and angle earn'd his bread;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 137
				-
					-
						But wisely from th' infectious world withdrew:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Poor was his house; his father's painful hand
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 140
				-
					-
						As flames among the lofty woods are thrown
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 141
				-
					-
						On diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 142
				-
					-
						The laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 143
				-
					-
						The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 144
				-
					-
						Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 145
				-
					-
						Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 146
				-
					-
						They roll to sea with unresisted force,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 147
				-
					-
						And down the rocks precipitate their course:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 148
				-
					-
						Not with less rage the rival heroes take
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 149
				-
					-
						Their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 150
				-
					-
						With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;

					-
						And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 152
				-
					-
						Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 153
				-
					-
						And hearts are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 154
				-
					-
						They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 155
				-
					-
						And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 156
				-
					-
						Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 157
				-
					-
						From a long royal race of Latian kings,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 158
				-
					-
						Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 159
				-
					-
						Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 160
				-
					-
						Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 161
				-
					-
						His living load, his dying body tore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 162
				-
					-
						His starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 163
				-
					-
						Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 164
				-
					-
						Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 165
				-
					-
						Affronted Turnus in the middle space:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 166
				-
					-
						The prince encounter'd him in full career,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 167
				-
					-
						And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 168
				-
					-
						So fatally the flying weapon sped,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 169
				-
					-
						That thro' his helm it pierc'd his head.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 170
				-
					-
						Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 171
				-
					-
						In vain the strongest of th' Arcadian band:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 172
				-
					-
						Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 173
				-
					-
						Availing aid against th' Aenean sword,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 174
				-
					-
						Which to his naked heart pursued the course;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 175
				-
					-
						Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 176
				-
					-
						Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 177
				-
					-
						Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 178
				-
					-
						Were doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd his date;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 179
				-
					-
						But who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 180
				-
					-
						In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 181
				-
					-
						Two palaces, and was from each expell'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 182
				-
					-
						Of all the mighty man, the last remains
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 183
				-
					-
						A little spot of foreign earth contains.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 184
				-
					-
						And now both hosts their broken troops unite
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 185
				-
					-
						In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 186
				-
					-
						Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 187
				-
					-
						The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 188
				-
					-
						Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 189
				-
					-
						The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 190
				-
					-
						They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 191
				-
					-
						Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 192
				-
					-
						And, where one falls, another fills his place.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 193
				-
					-
						The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 194
				-
					-
						To leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 195
				-
					-
						For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 196
				-
					-
						In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 197
				-
					-
						He views th' unguarded city from afar,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 198
				-
					-
						In careless quiet, and secure of war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 199
				-
					-
						Occasion offers, and excites his mind
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 200
				-
					-
						To dare beyond the task he first design'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 201
				-
					-
						Resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 202
				-
					-
						Attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 203
				-
					-
						The crowding troops about their gen'ral stand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 204
				-
					-
						All under arms, and wait his high command.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 205
				-
					-
						Then thus the lofty prince: "Hear and obey,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 206
				-
					-
						Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 207
				-
					-
						Jove is with us; and what I have decreed
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 208
				-
					-
						Requires our utmost vigor, and our speed.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 209
				-
					-
						Your instant arms against the town prepare,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 210
				-
					-
						The source of mischief, and the seat of war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 211
				-
					-
						This day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the sky,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 212
				-
					-
						Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 213
				-
					-
						The people shall be slaves, unless in time
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 214
				-
					-
						They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 215
				-
					-
						Twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 216
				-
					-
						Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 217
				-
					-
						Your force against the perjur'd city bend.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 218
				-
					-
						There it began, and there the war shall end.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 219
				-
					-
						The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 220
				-
					-
						Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 221
				-
					-
						He finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 222
				-
					-
						Form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 223
				-
					-
						Without the town, an unprovided train
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 224
				-
					-
						Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 225
				-
					-
						Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 226
				-
					-
						And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 227
				-
					-
						The flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 228
				-
					-
						And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 229
				-
					-
						Advancing to the front, the hero stands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 230
				-
					-
						And, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 231
				-
					-
						Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 232
				-
					-
						Upbraids with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 233
				-
					-
						Declares the royal honor doubly stain'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 234
				-
					-
						And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 235
				-
					-
						Dissenting clamors in the town arise;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 236
				-
					-
						Each will be heard, and all at once advise.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 237
				-
					-
						One part for peace, and one for war contends;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 8: Verse 238
				-
					-
						Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 9
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The helpless king is hurried in the throng,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 2
				-
					-
						And, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 5
				-
					-
						They run around, or labor on their wings,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 6
				-
					-
						Disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the sky.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 9
				-
					-
						But fate and envious fortune now prepare
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 10
				-
					-
						To plunge the Latins in the last despair.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 12
				-
					-
						And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 14
				-
					-
						No troops of Turnus in the field appear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And then concludes the royal youth is slain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 18
				-
					-
						The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 19
				-
					-
						She calls herself the cause of all this ill,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 20
				-
					-
						And owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 21
				-
					-
						She raves against the gods; she beats her breast;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 22
				-
					-
						She tears with both her hands her purple vest:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then round a beam a running noose she tied,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 26
				-
					-
						And to her dames and to her daughter known,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 27
				-
					-
						The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 28
				-
					-
						And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 29
				-
					-
						With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 30
				-
					-
						The spreading rumor fills the public place:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 32
				-
					-
						And silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Latinus tears his garments as he goes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Both for his public and his private woes;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 35
				-
					-
						With filth his venerable beard besmears,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 36
				-
					-
						And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 37
				-
					-
						And much he blames the softness of his mind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Obnoxious to the charms of womankind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 39
				-
					-
						And soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 40
				-
					-
						To break the solemn league so long desir'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 41
				-
					-
						Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 43
				-
					-
						And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 44
				-
					-
						His flying coursers please him less and less,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 45
				-
					-
						Asham'd of easy fight and cheap success.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 47
				-
					-
						The distant cries come driving in the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 48
				-
					-
						Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 49
				-
					-
						A jarring mixture, and a boding sound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 50
				-
					-
						"Alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 51
				-
					-
						What doleful clamors from the town arise?"
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Confus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 53
				-
					-
						She who the driver's office now sustains,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Replies: "Neglect, my lord, these new alarms;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 56
				-
					-
						There want not others to defend the wall.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 57
				-
					-
						If by your rival's hand th' Italians fall,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 58
				-
					-
						So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 59
				-
					-
						In honor equal, equal in success."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 60
				-
					-
						To this, the prince: "O sister- for I knew
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 61
				-
					-
						The peace infring'd proceeded first from you;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 62
				-
					-
						I knew you, when you mingled first in fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 63
				-
					-
						And now in vain you would deceive my sight-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 64
				-
					-
						Why, goddess, this unprofitable care?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 65
				-
					-
						Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And see your brother bleeding on the plain?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 68
				-
					-
						For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Or how resist his fate's prevailing force?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 70
				-
					-
						These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 72
				-
					-
						I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 73
				-
					-
						My name invoking to revenge his death.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 74
				-
					-
						Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 75
				-
					-
						To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 76
				-
					-
						On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 77
				-
					-
						His vest and armor are the victor's prize.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Which only wanted, to complete my shame?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 80
				-
					-
						How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 81
				-
					-
						How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 83
				-
					-
						(Since those above so small compassion show,)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 85
				-
					-
						Which not belies my great forefather's name!"
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 86
				-
					-
						He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 88
				-
					-
						Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 90
				-
					-
						"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Our last relief: compassionate your friends!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 93
				-
					-
						With arms invests, with flames invades the town:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 94
				-
					-
						The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 95
				-
					-
						To drive along the deluge of the fire.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 96
				-
					-
						All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 98
				-
					-
						Doubts to deliver or defend the town,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Whom to reject, or whom to call his son.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 100
				-
					-
						The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 101
				-
					-
						Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 102
				-
					-
						'T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 103
				-
					-
						With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 104
				-
					-
						On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 105
				-
					-
						The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 106
				-
					-
						An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 107
				-
					-
						You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 108
				-
					-
						Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 110
				-
					-
						And various cares revolving in his mind:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 111
				-
					-
						Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 112
				-
					-
						And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 113
				-
					-
						And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 114
				-
					-
						And love by jealousy to madness wrought.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 115
				-
					-
						By slow degrees his reason drove away
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 116
				-
					-
						The mists of passion, and resum'd her sway.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 117
				-
					-
						Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 118
				-
					-
						And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 119
				-
					-
						A wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 120
				-
					-
						Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 121
				-
					-
						And bridges laid above to join the space,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 122
				-
					-
						And wheels below to roll from place to place.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 123
				-
					-
						"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 124
				-
					-
						The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 125
				-
					-
						The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 126
				-
					-
						Of a base coward blot your brother's fame.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 127
				-
					-
						Death is my choice; but suffer me to try
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 128
				-
					-
						My force, and vent my rage before I die."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 129
				-
					-
						He said; and, leaping down without delay,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 130
				-
					-
						Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 131
				-
					-
						Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 132
				-
					-
						And left the grieving goddess far behind.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 133
				-
					-
						As when a fragment, from a mountain torn
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 134
				-
					-
						By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 135
				-
					-
						Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 136
				-
					-
						Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 137
				-
					-
						Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 138
				-
					-
						Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 139
				-
					-
						Involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 9: Verse 140
				-
					-
						Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 10
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 1
				-
					-
						So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 2
				-
					-
						Should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 5
				-
					-
						And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 6
				-
					-
						First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 7
				-
					-
						He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 8
				-
					-
						"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The fight is mine; and me the gods require.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 10
				-
					-
						'T is just that I should vindicate alone
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 11
				-
					-
						The broken truce, or for the breach atone.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 12
				-
					-
						This day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Both armies from their bloody work desist,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 15
				-
					-
						And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 16
				-
					-
						The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 17
				-
					-
						The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Greedy of war where greater glory calls.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 20
				-
					-
						He springs to fight, exulting in his force
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 21
				-
					-
						His jointed armor rattles in the course.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 24
				-
					-
						His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 25
				-
					-
						And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 26
				-
					-
						The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 27
				-
					-
						Immovable their bodies, fix'd their sight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 30
				-
					-
						In silent order either army stands,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 31
				-
					-
						And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 35
				-
					-
						With swords to try their titles to the state.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 37
				-
					-
						They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 38
				-
					-
						They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 41
				-
					-
						And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Courage conspires with chance, and both ingage
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 43
				-
					-
						With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 44
				-
					-
						As when two bulls for their fair female fight
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 45
				-
					-
						In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 46
				-
					-
						With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 47
				-
					-
						Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 49
				-
					-
						And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 50
				-
					-
						With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 51
				-
					-
						And push for push, and wound for wound return;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 52
				-
					-
						Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 53
				-
					-
						Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 54
				-
					-
						Such was the combat in the listed ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 55
				-
					-
						So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 57
				-
					-
						The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 58
				-
					-
						On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 59
				-
					-
						Loaded with death, that other scale descends.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 60
				-
					-
						Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 63
				-
					-
						As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 64
				-
					-
						But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 65
				-
					-
						And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 67
				-
					-
						When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 71
				-
					-
						'T was not the fated sword his father bore,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 72
				-
					-
						But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 73
				-
					-
						This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 74
				-
					-
						But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 76
				-
					-
						The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 78
				-
					-
						And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 79
				-
					-
						For here the Trojan troops the list surround,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 10: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 11
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 1
				-
					-
						Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 2
				-
					-
						His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 3
				-
					-
						And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 6
				-
					-
						With crimson toils, or in a river found,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 7
				-
					-
						High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 9
				-
					-
						The persecuted creature, to and fro,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 12
				-
					-
						The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 13
				-
					-
						His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Now to his beamy head he makes his way,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 16
				-
					-
						And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 17
				-
					-
						Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 11: Verse 18
				-
					-
						He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:
					-
			-
				Book 12: Stanza 12
			-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 1
				-
					-
						The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 4
				-
					-
						His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 6
				-
					-
						The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 7
				-
					-
						To lay in ashes, if they dare supply
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 8
				-
					-
						With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 10
				-
					-
						With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Ten times already round the listed place
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 12
				-
					-
						One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 13
				-
					-
						No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Within the space, an olive tree had stood,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 16
				-
					-
						A sacred shade, a venerable wood,

						For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 18
				-
					-
						Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 19
				-
					-
						Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 20
				-
					-
						With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 21
				-
					-
						To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 22
				-
					-
						Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 24
				-
					-
						Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 26
				-
					-
						That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 27
				-
					-
						His flying weapon might from far attain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 28
				-
					-
						Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 29
				-
					-
						Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 30
				-
					-
						"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 32
				-
					-
						Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 35
				-
					-
						Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 36
				-
					-
						Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 37
				-
					-
						But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 38
				-
					-
						Juturna took her time; and, while in vain
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 39
				-
					-
						He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 40
				-
					-
						And, in that imitated shape, restor'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 41
				-
					-
						To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 42
				-
					-
						The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 43
				-
					-
						Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 44
				-
					-
						T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 45
				-
					-
						From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 47
				-
					-
						One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 48
				-
					-
						And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 49
				-
					-
						Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 50
				-
					-
						Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 51
				-
					-
						"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 52
				-
					-
						To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 53
				-
					-
						What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 54

					-
						Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)

					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 55
				-
					-
						Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 56
				-
					-
						What more attempts for Turnus can be made,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 57
				-
					-
						That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 58
				-
					-
						Is it becoming of the due respect
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And awful honor of a god elect,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 60
				-
					-
						A wound unworthy of our state to feel,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 61
				-
					-
						Patient of human hands and earthly steel?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 62
				-
					-
						Or seems it just, the sister should restore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 63
				-
					-
						A second sword, when one was lost before,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 64
				-
					-
						And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 65
				-
					-
						For what, without thy knowledge and avow,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 67
				-
					-
						At last, in deference to my love, forbear
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 68
				-
					-
						To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 69
				-
					-
						Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Now all things to their utmost issue tend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Push'd by the Fates to their appointed
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 73
				-
					-
						While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 74
				-
					-
						For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 75
				-
					-
						Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 76
				-
					-
						And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Deform the royal house; and, from the side
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:

				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Now cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 80
				-
					-
						And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:

				-
					-
						"Because your dread decree too well I knew,

					Book 12: Stanza 12: Verse 82

						Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,

						'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife

					-
						Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.

						And now, resign'd to your superior might,

						And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.

				-
					-
						(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)

						The laws of either nation be the same;

						Speak the same language which they spoke before,

					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 23
				-
					-
						Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 24
				-
					-
						And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 25
				-
					-
						Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 26
				-
					-
						Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 27
				-
					-
						"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 28
				-
					-
						What empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 29
				-
					-
						'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 30
				-
					-
						Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 31
				-
					-
						Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 32
				-
					-
						What skill and courage can attempt in war;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 33
				-
					-
						Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 34
				-
					-
						Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 35
				-
					-
						The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 36
				-
					-
						"No threats of thine my manly mind can move;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 37
				-
					-
						'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 38
				-
					-
						He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 39
				-
					-
						The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 40
				-
					-
						Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 41
				-
					-
						An antique stone he saw, the common bound
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 42
				-
					-
						Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 43
				-
					-
						So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 44
				-
					-
						Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 45
				-
					-
						He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 46
				-
					-
						Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 47
				-
					-
						But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 48
				-
					-
						His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 49
				-
					-
						His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 50
				-
					-
						And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 51
				-
					-
						The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 52
				-
					-
						For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 53
				-
					-
						And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 54
				-
					-
						The sickly fancy labors in the night;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 55
				-
					-
						We seem to run; and, destitute of force,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 56
				-
					-
						Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 57
				-
					-
						In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 58
				-
					-
						The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 59
				-
					-
						And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 60
				-
					-
						So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 61
				-
					-
						All force of arms and points of art employ'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 62
				-
					-
						The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 63
				-
					-
						A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 64
				-
					-
						He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 65
				-
					-
						His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 66
				-
					-
						Once more he pauses, and looks out again,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 67
				-
					-
						And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 68
				-
					-
						Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 69
				-
					-
						And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 70
				-
					-
						Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 71
				-
					-
						Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 72
				-
					-
						Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 73
				-
					-
						Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 74
				-
					-
						The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 75
				-
					-
						The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 76
				-
					-
						With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 77
				-
					-
						Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 78
				-
					-
						Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 79
				-
					-
						Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 80
				-
					-
						The lance drove on, and bore the death along.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 81
				-
					-
						Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 82
				-
					-
						Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 83
				-
					-
						It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 84
				-
					-
						Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 85
				-
					-
						With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 86
				-
					-
						Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 87
				-
					-
						Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 88
				-
					-
						With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 89
				-
					-
						And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 90
				-
					-
						"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 91
				-
					-
						Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 92
				-
					-
						Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 93
				-
					-
						Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 94
				-
					-
						Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 95
				-
					-
						And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 96
				-
					-
						Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 97
				-
					-
						Give to my friends my body void of breath!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 98
				-
					-
						The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 99
				-
					-
						Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 100
				-
					-
						Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 101
				-
					-
						In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 102
				-
					-
						And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 103
				-
					-
						He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 104
				-
					-
						His manly soul with more compassion melt;
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 105
				-
					-
						When, casting down a casual glance, he spied
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 106
				-
					-
						The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 107
				-
					-
						The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 108
				-
					-
						From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 109
				-
					-
						Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 110
				-
					-
						(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 111
				-
					-
						"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 112
				-
					-
						Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 113
				-
					-
						To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 114
				-
					-
						'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 115
				-
					-
						He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 116
				-
					-
						Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 117
				-
					-
						The streaming blood distain'd his arms around,
					-
				-
					Book 12: Stanza 15: Verse 118
				-
					-
						And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.
