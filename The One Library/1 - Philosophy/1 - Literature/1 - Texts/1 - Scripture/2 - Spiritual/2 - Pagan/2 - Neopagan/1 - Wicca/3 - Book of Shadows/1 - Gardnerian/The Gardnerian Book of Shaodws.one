			-
				Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					It is most convenient to mark the circle with chalk, paint or otherwise, to
					show where it is; but marks on the carpet may be utilized. Furniture may be
					placed to indicate the bounds. The only circle that matters is the one drawn
					before every ceremony with either a duly consecrated Magic Sword or an Athame.
					The circle is usually nine feet in diameter, unless made for some very special
					purpose. There are two outer circles, each six inches apart, so the third
					circle has a diameter of eleven feet.
				-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 1
					-
						-
							Having chosen a place proper, take the sickle or scimitar of Art or a
							Witch's Athame, if thou mayest obtain it, and stick it into the center,
							then take a cord, and 'twere well to use the Cable Tow for this, and
							loop it over the Instrument, four and one half feet, and so trace out
							the circumference of the circle, which must be traced either with the
							Sword, or the knife with the black hilt, or it be of little avail, but
							ever leave open a door towards the North. Make in all 3 circles, one
							within the other , and write names of power between these.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 2
					-
						-
							First draw circle with Magic Sword or Athame.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 3
					-
						-
							Consecrate Salt and Water: Touch water with Athame, saying, "I exorcise
							thee, O creature of Water, that thou cast out from Thee all the
							impurities and uncleannesses of the Spirits of the World of Phantasm,
							so they may harm me not, in the names of Aradia and Cernunnos."
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 4
					-
						-
							Touching Salt with Athame, say, "The Blessings of Aradia and Cernunnos
							be upon this creature of Salt, and let all malignity and hindrance be
							cast forth hencefrom, and let all good enter herein, for without Thee
							man cannot live, wherefore I bless thee and invoke thee, that thou
							mayest aid me."
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 5
					-
						-
							Then put the Salt into the water.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 6
					-
						-
							Sprinkle with exorcised water.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 7
					-
						-
							Light candles; say, "I exorcise thee, O Creature of Fire, that every
							kind of Phantasm may retire from thee, and be unable to harm or deceive
							in any way, in the names of Aradia and Cernunnos."
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 8
					-
						-
							Caution initiate (if any); warn companions; enter circle and close
							doors with 3 pentagrams.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 9
					-
						-
							Proclaim object of working
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 10
					-
						-
							Circumambulate 3 times or more before commencing work.
						-
					-
						Chapter 1 - Casting the Circle: Paragraph 1 - Step 11
					-
						-
							Summon: "I summon, stir, and Call thee up, thou Mighty Ones of the
							East, South, West, and North." Salute and draw pentacle with Magic
							Sword or Athame, the first stroke being from the top down to the left.

				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					High Priestess stands in front of Altar, assumes Goddess position (arms
					crossed). Magus, kneeling in front of her, draws pentacle on her body with
					Phallus-headed Wand, invokes, "I Invoke and beseech Thee, O mighty Mother of
					all life and fertility. By seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and flower
					and fruit, by Life and Love, do I invoke Thee to descend into the body of thy
					servant and High Priestess [name]." The Moon having been drawn down, i.e., link
					established, Magus and other men give Fivefold Kiss:
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					(kissing feet) "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways";
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					(kissing knees) "Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar";
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					(kissing womb) "Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be";

				-
					(kissing breasts) "Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty and in strength";
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					(kissing lips) "Blessed be thy lips, that shall speak the sacred names."

			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Women all bow.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - Drawing Down the Moon: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					If there be an initiation, then at this time the Magus and the High Priestess
					in Goddess position (Arms Crossed) says the Charge while the Initiate stands
					outside the circle.

				Chapter 3 - The Charge: "Lift Up the Veil": Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Magus: "Listen to the words of the Great mother, who of old was also called
					among men Artemis, Astarte, Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
					Arianrhod, Bride, and by many other names."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Charge: "Lift Up the Veil": Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					High Priestess: "At mine Altars the youth of Lacedaemon in Sparta made due
					sacrifice. Whenever ye have need of anything, once in the month, and better it
					be when the moon is full, ye shall assemble in some secret place and adore the
					spirit of Me who am Queen of all Witcheries and magics. There ye shall
					assemble, ye who are fain to learn all sorcery, yet have not won its deepest
					secrets. To these will I teach things that are yet unknown. And ye shall be
					free from slavery, and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall be naked in
					your rites, both men and women, and ye shall dance, sing, feast, make music,
					and love, all in my praise. There is a Secret Door that I have made to
					establish the way to taste even on earth the elixir of immortality. Say, 'Let
					ecstasy be mine, and joy on earth even to me, To Me,' For I am a gracious
					Goddess. I give unimaginable joys on earth, certainty, not faith, while in
					life! And upon death, peace unutterable, rest, and ecstasy, nor do I demand
					aught in sacrifice."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Charge: "Lift Up the Veil": Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Magus: "Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Charge: "Lift Up the Veil": Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					High Priestess: "I love you: I yearn for you: pale or purple, veiled or
					voluptuous. I who am all pleasure, and purple and drunkenness of the innermost
					senses, desire you. Put on the wings, arouse the coiled splendor within you.
					Come unto me, for I am the flame that burns in the heart of every man, and the
					core of every Star. Let it be your inmost divine self who art lost in the
					constant rapture of infinite joy. Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy
					and beauty. Remember that all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals. So let
					there be beauty and strength, leaping laughter, force and fire by within you.
					And if thou sayest, 'I have journeyed unto thee, and it availed me not,' rather
					shalt thou say, 'I called upon thee, and I waited patiently, and Lo, thou wast
					with me from the beginning,' for they that ever desired me shall ever attain
					me, even to the end of all desire.

				Chapter 3 - The Charge: "Lift Up the Veil": Paragraph 5

					This much of the rites must ever be performed to prepare for any initiation,
					whether of one degree or of all three.

				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Magus leaves circle by the doorway, goes to Postulant, and says, "Since there
					is no other brother here, I must be thy sponsor, as well as priest. I am about
					to give you a warning. If you are still of the same mind, answer it with these
					words: 'Perfect Love and Perfect Trust.'" Placing the point of the sword to the
					Postulant's breast, he says, "O thou who standeth on the threshold between the
					pleasant world of men and the domains of the Dread Lords of the Outer Spaces,
					hast thou the courage to make the Assay? For I tell thee verily, it were better
					to rush on my weapon and perish miserably than to make the attempt with fear in
					thy heart." Postulant: "I have two Passwords: Perfect Love and Perfect Trust."
					Magus drops the sword point, saying, "All who approach with perfect love and
					perfect trust are doubly welcome." Going around behind her, he blindfolds her,
					then putting his left arm around her waist and his right arm around her neck,
					he pulls her head back, says, "I give you the 3rd password, a Kiss to pass
					through this dread Door," and pushes her forward with his body, through the
					doorway and into the circle. Once inside, he releases her saying, "This is the
					way all are first brought into the circle." Magus closes the doorway by drawing
					the point of the sword across it three times, joining all three circles,
					saying, "Agla, Azoth, Adonai," then drawing three pentacles to seal it. Magus
					guides Postulant to south of altar, and whispers, "Now there is the Ordeal."
					Taking a short piece of cord from the altar, he ties it around her right ankle,
					saying, "Feet neither bound nor free." Taking a longer cord, he ties her hands
					together behind her back, then pulls them up, so that the arms form a triangle,
					and ties the cord around her neck, leaving the end dangling down in front as a
					Cable Tow. With the Cable Tow in his left hand and the sword in his right hand,
					the Magus leads her sunwise around the circle to the east, where he salutes
					with the sword and proclaims, "Take heed, O Lords of the Watchtowers of the
					East, (name), properly prepared, will be made a Priestess and a Witch." Magus
					leads her similarly to the south, west, and north, making the proclamation at
					each quarter. Next, clasping Postulant around the waist with his left arm, and
					holding the sword erect in his right hand, he makes her circumambulate three
					times around the circle with a half-running, half-dancing step. He halts her at
					the south of the altar, and strikes eleven knells on the bell. He then kneels
					at her feet, saying, "In other religions the postulant kneels, as the Priests
					claim supreme power, but in the Art Magical, we are taught to be humble, so we
					kneel to welcome them and say:
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					"Blessed be thy feet that have brought thee in these ways." (He kisses her
					feet.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					"Blessed be thy knees that shall kneel at the sacred altar." (He kisses her
					knees.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be." (He kisses her Organ of
					Generation.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"Blessed by thy breasts, formed in beauty and in strength." (He kisses her
					breasts.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Blessed be thy lips, which shall utter the sacred names." (He kisses her
					lips.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Take measure thus: height, around forehead, across the heart, and across the
					genitals. Magus says, "Be pleased to kneel," and helps her kneel before the
					altar. He ties the end of the Cable Tow to a ring in the altar, so that the
					postulant is bent sharply forward, with her head almost touching the floor. He
					also ties her feet together with the short cord. Magus strikes three knells on
					the bell and says, "Art ready to swear that thou wilt always be true to the
					Art?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Witch: "I am."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Magus strikes seven knells on the bell and says, "Before ye are sworn, art
					willing to pass the ordeal and be purified?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Witch: "I am."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Magus strikes eleven knells on the bell, takes the scourge from the altar, and
					gives a series of three, seven, nine, and 21 strokes with the scourge across
					the postulant's buttocks. Magus says, "Ye have bravely passed the test. Art
					always ready to help, protect, and defend thy Brothers and Sisters of the Art?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Witch: "I am."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Magus: "Art armed?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Witch: "With a knife in my hair."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					Magus: "Then on that knife wilt thou swear absolute secrecy?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					Witch: "I will."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					Magus: "Then say after me. 'I, (name), in the presence of the Mighty Ones, do
					of my own will and accord, most solemnly swear that I will ever keep secret and
					never reveal the secrets of the Art, except it be to a proper person, properly
					prepared, within a circle such as I am now in. All this I swear by my hopes of
					a future life, mindful that my measure has been taken, and may my weapons turn
					against me if I break this my solemn oath.'"

			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Magus now unbinds her feet, unties the Cable Tow from the altar, removes the
					blindfold, and helps her up to her feet.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					Magus says, "I hereby sign thee with the triple sign.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					"I consecrate thee with oil." (He anoints her with oil on the womb, the right
					breast, the left breast, and the womb again.)

			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					"I consecrate thee with wine." (He anoints her with wine in the same pattern.)
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					"I consecrate thee with my lips" (he kisses her in the same pattern),
					"Priestess and Witch."
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					Magus now unbinds her hands and removes the last cord, saying, "Now I Present
					to thee the Working Tools of a Witch. "First the Magic Sword. With this, as
					with the Athame, thou canst form all Magic Circles, dominate, subdue, and
					punish all rebellious Spirits and Demons, and even persuade the Angels and
					Geniuses. With this in your hand you are the ruler of the Circle. [Here "kiss"
					means that the initiate kisses the tool, and the Magus then kisses the Witch
					being initiated.]
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 24
			-
				-
					"Next I present the Athame. This is the true Witch's weapon and has all the
					powers of the Magic Sword [kiss].
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 25
			-
				-
					"Next I present the White-Handled Knife. Its use is to form all instruments
					used in the Art. It can only be properly used within a Magic Circle [Kiss].
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 26
			-
				-
					"Next I present the Wand. Its use is to call up and control certain Angels and
					geniuses, to whom it would not be mete to use the Magic Sword [Kiss].

			-
				-
					"Next I present the Censer of Incense. This is used to encourage and welcome
					Good Spirits and to banish Evil Spirits.[kiss]
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 29
			-
				-
					"Next I present the scourge. This is a sign of power and domination. It is also
					to cause suffering and purification, for it is written, to learn you must
					suffer and be purified. Art willing to suffer to learn?"
				-

				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 30
			-
				-
					Witch: "I am."[Kiss]
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - Initiation: First Degree: Paragraph 31
			-
				-
					Magus: "Next, and lastly I present the Cords. They are of use to bind the
					sigils in the Art, the material basis, and to enforce thy will. Also they are
					necessary in the oath. I Salute thee in the name of Aradia and Cernunnos, Newly
					made Priestess and Witch." Magus strikes seven knells on the bell and kisses
					Witch again, then circumambulates with her, proclaiming to the four quarters,
					"Hear, ye Mighty Ones, (name) hath been consecrated Priestess and Witch of the
					Gods." (Note, if ceremony ends here, close circle with "I thank ye for
					attending, and I dismiss ye to your pleasant abodes. Hail and farewell." If
					not, go to next degree.)

			-
				Chapter 5 - Initiation: Second Degree: Paragraph 1

				-
					Magus binds Witch as before, but does not blindfold her, and circumambulates
					with her, proclaims to the four quarters, "Hear, ye Mighty Ones, (name), a duly
					consecrated Priestess and Witch, is now properly prepared to be made a High
					Priestess and Witch Queen." Magus now leads her thrice around the circle with
					the half-running, half-dancing step, halts south of the altar, has the Witch
					kneel, and ties her down to the altar as before.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - Initiation: Second Degree: Paragraph 2
			-

					Magus: "Assist me to erect the Ancient Altar, at which in days past all

					that her vagina is approximately at the center of the circle], and the sacred
					place was the point within the center of the circle, as we of old times have
					been taught, that the point within the center is the origin of all things.
					Therefore should we adore it." [kiss]

				Chapter 12 - On Chants: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Of old there were many chants and songs used especially in the Dances. Many of
					these have been forgotten by us here, but we know that they used cries of IAU
					which seems muchly like the cries EVO or EVOHE of the ancients. Much dependeth
					on the pronunciation if this be so. In my youth, when I heard IAU it seemed to
					be AEIOU, or rather, AAAEEIOOOOUU. This may be but the natural way to prolong
					it to make it fit for a call, but it suggests that these be possibly the
					initials of an invocation as Agla is said to be, and of sooth 'tis said that
					the whole Hebrew alphabet is said to be such, and for this reason is recited as
					a most powerful charm, but at least this is certain, these cries during the
					dances do have profound effect, as I myself have seen.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - On Chants: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Other calls are IEHOUA and EHEIE; also Ho Ho Ho Ise Ise Ise.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - On Chants: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					IEO VEO VEO VEO VEOV OROV OV OVOVO may be a spell but is more likely to be a
					call. 'Tis like the EVOE EVOE of the Greeks and the "Heave ho!" of sailors.
					"Emen hetan" and "Ab hur, ab hus" seem calls; as "Horse and hattock, horse and
					go, horse and Pellatis, ho, ho, ho!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - On Chants: Paragraph 4

					"Thout, tout a tout tout, throughout and about" and "Rentum tormentum" are

				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Ever remember the promise of the goddess, "For ecstasy is mine and joy on
					earth" so let there ever be joy in your heart. Greet people with joy, be glad
					to see them. If times be hard, think, "It might have been worse. I at least
					have known the joys of the Sabbath, and I will know them again." Think of the
					grandeur, beauty, and Poetry of the rites, of the loved ones you meet through
					them. If you dwell on this inner joy, your health will be better. You must try
					to banish all fear, for it will really touch you. It may hurt your body, but
					your soul is beyond it all.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					And ever remember, that if you help others it makes you forget your own woes.
					And if another be in pain, do what you may to distract his attention from it.
					Do not say "You have no pain," but if you may, administer the drugs which sooth
					as well as those that cure. But ever strive to make them believe they are
					getting better. Install into them happy thoughts. If you can only get this into
					his inner mind so that it be always believed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					To this end it is not wrong to let people think that we of the cult have more
					power than we have. For the truth is that if they believe we have more power
					than we really possess, we do really possess these powers, insomuch we can do
					good to them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					You must try to find out about people. If you tell a slightly sick man, "You
					are looking better. You will soon be well," he will feel better, but if he is
					really ill, or in pain, his Knowledge that he is in pain will cause him to
					doubt your words in future. But if you give him one of the drugs and then say,
					"The pain is growing less. Soon it will be gone," because the pain goes, the
					next time you say, "The pain is going," he will believe you and the pain will
					really get less. But you must ever say so with conviction, and this conviction
					must come from your believing it yourself, because you yourself know that if
					you can fix his mind so that he believes you, it is true.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					'Tis often better to look exactly between their eyes, looking as if your eyes
					pierced their heads, opening your eyes as wide as you may and never blink. This
					continued gazing oft causes the patient to grow sleepy. If they show signs of
					this, say "You are growing sleepy. You will sleep, you are tired. Sleep. Your
					eyes grow tired. Sleep." If they close their eyes, say "Your eyes close, you
					are tired, you cannot open your eyes." If they cannot, say "Your arms are
					tired, you cannot raise them." If they cannot, say "I am master of your mind.
					You must ever believe what I tell you. When I look like this into your eyes you
					will sleep and be subject to my will," then tell them they will sleep and wake
					up refreshed, feeling better. Continue this with soothing and healing drugs,
					and try to infuse into them the feeling of ecstasy that you feel at the
					Sabbath. They cannot feel it in full, but you can command them to feel what is
					in your own mind, and try to concentrate on this ecstasy. I f you may safely
					tell that you are of the Cult, your task may be easier. And it were well to
					command them to know it only with their sleeping mind, and forget it, or to be
					at least unable to tell anyone about it when awake. A good way is to command
					them that, if they are ever questioned about Witchcraft or Witches, to
					immediately fall asleep.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Ever remember if tempted to admit or boast of belonging to the cult you be
					endangering your brothers, for though now the fires of persecution may have
					died down, who knows when they may be revived? Many priests have knowledge of
					our secrets, and they well know that, though much religious bigotry has calmed
					down, many people would wish to join our cult. And if the truth were known of
					its joys, the Churches would lose power, so if we take many recruits, we may
					loose the fires of persecution against us a gain. So ever keep the secrets.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Think joy, think love, try to help others and bring joy into their lives.
					Children are naturally easier to influence than grown people. Ever strive to
					work through people's existing beliefs. For instance, more than half of the
					world believe in amulets. An ordinary stone is not an amulet but if it hath a
					natural hole in it, it must be something unusual, so if the patient hath this
					belief give him one. But first carry it next your skin for a few days, forcing
					your will into it, to cure pain, to feel s safe, or against their particular
					fear, and this amulet may keep imposing your will when you are absent. The
					masters of talismans knew this full well when they say they must be made in a
					circle, to avoid distraction, by someone whose mind is on the subject of the
					work.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					But keep your own mind happy. Remember the Words of the Goddess: "I give
					unimaginable joys on Earth, certainty, not faith, while in life, and upon
					death, peace unutterable, rest, and ecstasy, and the promise that you will
					return again." In the old days many of us went to the flames laughing and
					singing, and so we may again. We may have joy in life and beauty, and peace and
					Death and the promise of return.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					The Bible speaks sooth, "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken
					spirit breaketh the bones." But you may not have a merry heart. Perchance you
					were born under an evil star. I think that the effects of the stars are
					overestimated, but you cannot make a merry heart to order, you say. But you
					can, in the Cult; there be secret processes by which your will and imagination
					may be influenced. This process also affects the body, and brings it to joy.
					Your body is happy, so your mind is happy . You are well because you are happy,
					and you are happy because you are well.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - To Help the Sick: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Prayer may be used with good result if the patient believes it can and will
					work. Many believe it can, but do not believe their God or saint will help.
					Prayers to the Goddess help, especially the Amalthean Horn Prayer, as it causes
					stimulation to the body as well as to the mind.

						about thy heart. Then spend, Pitiful Love, loveliest Pity, descend And

					-
				-
					Chapter 14 - The Scourge and the Kiss: Paragraph 1 - Invocation: Step 3
				-
					-
						Ask the Goddess to help you to obtain your desires, then Scourge again to
						bind the spell. This be powerful in ill luck and for sickness. It must be
						said in a Circle, and you must be properly prepared and well purified, both
						before and after saying, to bind the spell. Before starting you must make a
						very clear picture in your mind of what you wish. Make yourself see the
						wish obtained. Be sure in your own mind exactly what it is and how it is to
						be fulfilled. This spell is the one that was taught to me long ago and I
						have found it works, but I don't think there is any special virtue in these
						words. Any others can be substituted provided they ask the goddess's (or
						gods') help, and say clearly what you wish and you form the clear mental
						image; and if it doesn't work at first, keep on trying till it works. Your
						helper, who wields the scourge, must know what you wish, and also form the
						mental image. And at first at any rate, it will be better for you to work
						the spell, then for the girl to take your place and work it also; you
						scourge her. Don't try anything difficult at first, and do it at least once
						a week till it works. You have to get into sympathy with each other, before
						anything happens, and regular working helps this. Of spells, the exact
						words matter little if the intent be clear and you raise the true power,
						and sufficient thereof. Always in rhyme they are. There is something queer
						about rhyme. I have tried, and the same seem to lose their power if you
						miss the rhyme. Also in rhyme, the words seem to say themselves. You do not
						have to pause and think: "What comes next?" Doing this takes away much of
						your intent.

				Chapter 14 - The Scourge and the Kiss: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Order and discipline must be kept. A High Priest or Priestess may and should
					punish all faults to this end, and all of the Cult must accept such corrections
					willingly. All are brothers and sisters, for this reason: that even the High
					Priestess must submit to the scourge. Each fault should be corrected
					separately. The Priest or Priestess must be properly prepared and call the
					culprit to trial. They must be prepared as for initiation and kneel, be told
					their fault and sentence pronounced. Punishment should be the scourge, followed
					by a forfeit such as several fivefold kisses or something of this nature. The
					culprit must acknowledge the justice of the punishment by kissing hands and
					scourge on receiving sentence and again when thanking for punishment received.

					The scourgings are 3, 7, 9 (thrice three), and 21 (thrice seven) 40 in all. It
					is not meet to make offerings [scourgings] of less than two score to the
					Goddess, for here be a mystery. The fortunate numbers be: 3 and 5. For three
					added to two (the Perfect Couple) be five. And three and five be eight; eight
					and five be thirteen; thirteen and eight be twenty-one. The Fivefold Kiss is
					called 5, but there are 8 kisses, for there be 2 feet and 2 knees and genitals
					and 2 breasts and the lips. And 5 times 8 be two score. Also, fortunate numbers
					be 3, 7, 8, and 21, which total 40, or two score. For each man and woman hath
					ten fingers and ten toes, so each totals a score. And a perfect couple be two
					score. So a lesser number would not be perfect prayer. If more are required
					make it a perfect number, as four score or six score. Also there be Eight
					Elemental Weapons.

					It is said, "When a woman takes the main part in worship of the Male God, she
					must be girt with a sword." Note. This hath been explained as meaning that a
					man should be Magus representing the God, but if no one of sufficient rank and
					knowledge be present, a woman armed as a man may take his place. The sheath
					should be worn in a belt. She should carry the sword in hand, but if she has to
					use her hands, she should sheath the sword. Any other woman in the circle while
					this worship is performed shall be sword in hand. Those outside the circle only
					have the athame. A woman may impersonate either the God or the Goddess, but a
					man may only impersonate the God.

					Keep this book in your own hand of write. Let brothers and Sisters copy what
					they will, but never let this book out of your hands, and never keep the
					writings of another, for if it be found in their hand of write, they may well
					be taken and tortured. Each should guard his own writings and destroy them
					whenever danger threatens. Learn as much as you may by heart, and when the
					danger is past, rewrite your book. For this reason, if any die, destroy their
					book if they have not been able to, for, if it be found nd, 'tis clear proof
					against them. "Ye may not be a Witch alone"; so all their friends be in danger
					of the torture. So destroy everything not necessary. If your book be found on
					you, 'tis clear proof against you. You may be tortured. Keep all thought of the
					cult from your mind. Say you had bad dreams, that a Devil caused you to write
					this without your knowledge. Think to yourself, "I Know Nothing. I Remember
					nothing. I have forgotten all." Drive this into your mind. If the torture be
					too great to bear, say, "I will confess. I cannot bear this torment. What do
					you want me to say? Tell me and I will say it." If they try to make you talk of
					the broth , do not, but if they try to make you speak of impossibilities, such
					as flying through the air, consorting with the Devil, sacrificing children, or
					eating men's flesh, say, "I had an evil dream. I was not myself. I was crazed."
					Not all Magistrates are bad. If there be an excuse, they may show you mercy. If
					you have confessed aught, deny it afterwards. Say you babbled under the
					torture; you knew not what you did or said. If you be condemned, fear not. The
					Brotherhood is powerful. They may help you to escape if you are steadfast. If
					you betray aught, there is no hope for you, in this life, or in that which is
					to come. But, 'tis sure, that if steadfast you go to the pyre, drugs will reach
					you. You will feel naught, and you go but to Death and what lies beyond, the
					ecstasy of the Goddess. The same with the working Tools. Let them be as
					ordinary things that anyone may have in their homes. The Pentacles shall be of
					wax that they may be melted or broken at once. Have no sword unless your rank
					allows you one. Have no names or signs on anything. Write them on in ink before
					consecrating them and wash it off at once when finished. Never boast, never
					threaten, never say you wish ill to anyone. If any speak of the craft, say,
					"Speak not to me of such, it frightens me, 'tis evil luck to speak of it."

				Chapter 17 - Of the Ordeal of the Art Magical: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Learn of the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honour, for 'tis the
					spirit that stoopeth the shoulders and not the weight. Armour is heavy, yet it
					is a proud burden and a man standeth upright in it. Limiting and constraining
					any of the senses serves to increase the concentration of another. Shutting the
					eyes aids the hearing. So the binding of the initiate's hands increases the
					mental perception, while the scourge increaseth the inner vision. So the
					initiate goeth through it proudly, like a princess, knowing it but serves to
					increase her glory. But this can only be done by the aid of another
					intelligence and in a circle, to prevent the power thus generated being lost.
					Priests attempt to do the same with their scourgings and mortifications of the
					flesh. But lacking the aid of bonds and their attention being distracted by
					their scourging themselves and what little power they do produce being
					dissipated, as they do not usually work within a circle, it is little wonder
					that they oft fail. Monks and hermits do better, as they are apt to work in
					tiny cells and coves, which in some way act as circles. The Knights of the
					Temple, who used mutually to scourge each other in an octagon, did better
					still; but they apparently did not know the virtue of bonds and did evil, man
					to man. But perhaps some did know? What of the Church's charge that they wore
					girdles or cords?

					This cometh to different people in diverse ways. 'Tis seldom it cometh
					naturally, but it can be induced in many ways. Deep and prolonged meditation
					may do it, but only if you be a natural, and usually prolonged fasting was also
					necessary. Of old monks and nuns obtained visions by long vigils, combined with
					fasting, flagellation till the blood came, and other mortifications of the
					flesh, and so undoubtedly had visions. In the East it is tried with various
					tortures, at the same time sitting in cramped postures, which retard the flow
					of blood, and these torments, long and continued, give good results. But in the
					Art we are taught an easier way to intensify the imagination, at the same time
					controlling the blood supply, and this may best be done by using the ritual.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - To Gain the Sight: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Incense is also good to propitiate the Spirits, but also to induce relaxation
					and to help to build up the atmosphere which is necessary to suggestibility.
					(For our human eyes are so blind to what really is, that it is often necessary
					to suggest that it is there, before we may see it, as we may point out to
					another something at a distance before they may see it themselves. Gum mastic,
					aromatic rush roots, cinnamon bark, musk, juniper, sandalwood, and ambergris in
					combination are all good, but patchouli is best of all. And if you may have
					hemp, 'tis better still, but be very careful of this.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - To Gain the Sight: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The circle being formed, all properly prepared, and the Rites done, and all
					purified, the aspirant should warlock and take his tutor round the circle,
					saluting the Mighty Ones, and invoke them to aid the operation. Then both dance
					round till giddy, invoking or using chants. Scourge. Then the Tutor should
					warlock very tightly, but not so to cause discomfort, but enough to retard the
					blood slightly. Again they should dance round, chanting, then scourge with
					light, steady, monotonous, slow strokes. It is very good that the pupil may see
					them coming (this may be arranged from position, or if a big mirror is
					available, this can be used with excellent effect) as this has the effect of
					passes, and helps greatly to stimulate the imagination, and it is important
					that they be not hard, the object being not to do more than draw the blood to
					that part and so away from the brain. This with the tight warlocking, which
					should be warricked, slows down the circulation of the blood, and the passes
					soon induce a drowsiness and a stupor. The tutor should watch for this. As soon
					as the aspirant sleeps, the scourging should cease. The tutor should also watch
					that the pupil become not cold, and if they struggle or become distressed, they
					should be at once awakened. (Note: if it cannot be arranged for the pupil to
					see, the wand may be used, for a time, then return to scourging.)

					Do not be discouraged if no results come after two or three attempts. It will
					come, when both are in the right state. When you get some result, then results
					will come more quickly. Soon some of the ritual may be shortened, but never
					neglect to invoke the Goddess, and the Mighty Ones, or to form the Circle and
					do everything rightly. And for good and clear results, it is ever better to do
					too much ritual than too little.

					It hath been found that this practice doth often cause a fondness between

					any reason it is undesirable that there be any great fondness between aspirant
					and tutor, this may be easily avoided, by both parties from the onset firmly
					resolving in their minds that if any doth ensue, it shall be that of brother
					and sister or parent and child. And it is for this reason that a man may only
					be taught by a woman and a woman by a man, and that man and man, and woman and

					Remember, the Circle, properly constructed, is ever necessary to prevent the
					power released from being dissipated. It is also a barrier against any
					disturbances of mischievous forces, for to obtain good results you must be free
					from all disturbances. Remember that darkness, points of light gleaming amid
					the surrounding dark, incense, and the steady passes by a white arm are not
					stage effects. They are the mechanical implements which start the suggestions,
					which later unlocks the knowledge that it is possible to obtain the divine
					ecstasy, and so attain knowledge and communion with the Divine Goddess. When
					once you have attained this, Ritual is not needed, as you may attain the state
					of ecstasy at will, but till then, or if you having attained this yourself, and
					wish to bring a companion to this state of joy, ritual is best.

			Chapter 20 - Power

				Chapter 20 - Power: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Power is latent in the body and may be drawn out and used in various ways by
					the skilled. But unless confined in a circle it will be swiftly dissipated.
					Hence the importance of a properly constructed circle. Power seems to exude
					from the body via the skin and possibly from the orifices of the body; hence
					you should be properly prepared. The slightest dirt spoils everything, which
					shows the importance of thorough cleanliness. The attitude of mind has great
					effect, so only work with a spirit of reverence. A little wine taken and
					repeated during the ceremony, if necessary, helps to produce power. Other
					strong drinks or drugs may be used, but it is necessary to be very moderate,
					for if you are confused, even slightly, you cannot control the power you evoke.
					The simplest way is by dancing and singing monotonous chants, slowly at first
					and gradually quickening the tempo until giddiness ensues. Then the calls may
					be used, or even wild and meaningless shrieking produces power. But this method
					inflames the mind and renders it difficult to control the power, though control
					may be gained through practice. The scourge is a far better way, for it
					stimulates and excites both body and soul, yet one e easily retains control.
					The Great Rite is far the best. It releases enormous power, but the conditions
					and circumstances make it difficult for the mind to maintain control at first.
					It is again a matter of practice and the natural strength of the operator's
					will and, in a lesser degree, of those of his assistants. If, as of old, there
					were many trained assistants present and all wills properly attuned, wonders
					occurred. Sorcerers chiefly used the blood sacrifice; and while we hold this to
					be evil, we cannot deny that this method is very efficient. Power flashes forth
					from newly shed blood, instead of exuding slowly as by our method. The victim's
					terror and anguish add keenness, and even quite a small animal can yield
					enormous power. The great difficulty is in the human mind controlling the power
					of the lower animal mind. But sorcerers claim they have methods for effecting
					this and that the difficulty disappears the higher her the animal used, and
					when the victim is human disappears entirely. (The practice is an abomination
					but it is so.) Priests know this well; and by their auto-da-fé, with the
					victims' pain and terror (the fires acting much the same as circles), obtained
					much power. Of old the Flagellants certainly evoked power, but through not
					being confined in a circle much was lost. The amount of power raised was so
					great and continuous that anyone with knowledge could direct and use it; and it
					is most probable that the classical and heathen sacrifices were used in the
					same way. There are whispers that when the human victim was a willing
					sacrifice, with his mind directed on the Great Work and with highly skilled
					assistants, wonders ensued but of this I would not speak.

					Naked, but sandals (not shoes) may be worn. For initiation, tie hands behind
					back, pull up to small of back, and tie ends in front of throat, leaving a
					cable-tow to lead by, hanging down in front. (Arms thus form a triangle at
					back.) When initiate is kneeling at altar, the cable-tow is tied to a ring in
					the altar. A short cord is tied like a garter round the initiate's left leg
					above the knee, with ends tucked in. Another is tied round right ankle and ends
					tucked in so as to be out of the way while mov ing about. These cords are used
					to tie feet together while initiate is kneeling at the altar and must be long
					enough to do this firmly. Knees must also be firmly tied. This must be
					carefully done. If the aspirant complains of pain, the bonds must be loosened
					slightly; always remember the object is to retard the blood flow enough to
					induce a trance state. This involves slight discomfort, but great discomfort
					prevents the trance state; so it is best to spend some little time loosening a
					nd tightening the bonds until they are just right. The aspirant alone can tell
					you when this is so. This, of course, does not apply to the initiation, as then
					no trance is desired; but for the purpose of ritual it is good that the
					initiates be bound firmly enough to feel they are absolutely helpless but
					without discomfort.

					When the center is reached (and this had better be marked by a stone), she
					suddenly turns and dances back, kissing each man as she comes to him. All men
					and women turn likewise and dance back, men kissing girls and girls kissing
					men. All in time to music, it is a merry game, but must be practiced to be done
					well. Note, the musicians should watch the dancers and make the music fast or
					slow as is best. For the beginners it should be slow, or there will be
					confusion. It is most excellent to get people to know each other at big

					Strive to communicate with your tutor first; if they have the Sight they will

				-
					It is important to work naked from the start, so it becometh as second nature,
					and no thought of "I have no clothes" shall ever intrude and take your
					attention from the work. Also, your skin being so accustomed to unconfinement,
					when power is given off the flow is more easy and regular. Also, when dancing
					you are free and unconfined. . . . And the greatest of all, the touch of the
					body of your beloved thrills your inmost soul, and so your body gives out its
					utmost power; and then it is most important of all that there is not the
					slightest thing to divert the attention, for then the mind must seize and mold
					the power generated, and redirect it to the desired end with all the force and
					frenzy of the imagination. It has been said that no real knowledge may be
					gained our way, that our practices are such that they can only lead to lust;
					but this is not really so. Our aim is to gain the inner sight, and we do it the
					most natural and easy way. Our opponents' aim is ever to prevent man and woman
					from loving, thinking that everything that helps or even permits them to love
					is wicked and vile. To us it is natural, and if it aids the Great Work it is
					good. 'Tis true that a couple burning with a frenzy for knowledge may go
					straight to their goal, but the average couple have not this fire. We show them
					the way, our system of props and aids (i.e., magic ritual). A couple working
					with nothing but lust will never attain in any case; but a couple who love each
					other dearly should already be sleeping together, and the first frenzy of love
					will have passed, and their souls will already be in sympathy. If the first
					time or two they do stay a while to worship Aphrod ite, 'tis only a day or two
					lost, and the intense pleasure they obtain only leads them again to the
					mysteries of Hermes, their souls more attuned to the great search. Once they
					have pierced the veil they will not look back. This rite may be used as the
					greatest of magics if it be done with both partners firmly fixing their minds
					on the object and not thinking of sex at all. That is, you must so firmly fix
					your mind on your object that sex and all else are naught. You inflame your
					will to such an extent that you may create a strain on the astral such that
					events happen.

					shall run. Beyond all seas and Earth's la st boundaries, beyond the Spring of
					night and the Heavens' vast expanse, there lies a majesty which is the domain

					sweet place, which is between the worlds of men and the domains of the Lords of
					the outer spaces, know that unless there is truth in thy heart, thy every
					effort is doomed to failure. HEAR THEN THE LAW: that thou lovest all things in
					nature; that thou shalt suffer no person to be harmed by thy hands or in thy
					mind; that thou walkest humbly in the ways of men and the ways of the Gods.
					Also it is the law that contentment thou shalt learn, through suffering, and
					from long years and from nobility of mind and of purpose, FOR THE WISE NEVER
					GROW OLD. Their minds are nourished by living in the daylight of the Gods, and
					if among the vulgar some discoveries should arise concerning some maxims of thy
					belief in the Gods, so do thou, for the most part, keep silent. For there is a
					great risk that thou mayest straightway vomit up th at which thou hast not
					digested, and when someone shall say to thee, "Thou knowest naught," and it
					bites thee not, then knowest thou that thou hast begun the work. And as sheep
					do not bring their food to the shepherd to show how much they have eaten, but
					digesting inwardly their provender, bear outwardly wool and milk, even so, do
					not thou display the maxims to the vulgar, but rather the works that flow when

					resurrection in a new body -- and magic controls them all. To fulfill love you
					must return at the same time and place as the loved one, and you must meet and
					know and remember and love them again. But to be reborn you must die and be
					ready for a new body; to die you must be born; without love you may not be born
					-- and these be all the magics. And our Goddess ever inclineth to love and
					mirth and happiness, and guardeth and cheriseth Her hidden children in life;
					and in death she teacheth the way to have communion, and even in this world She
					teacheth them the Mystery of the Magic Circle, which is placed between the

				-
					Then the one who is not the owner should give the Fivefold Kiss to the owner.
					For the final kiss, the tool should be placed between the breasts, and the two
					workers should embrace for as long as they feel like, it being held in place by
					their bodies. The new owner should use it immediately, i.e., cast (trace)
					Circle with Sword or Athame, wave wand to 4 quarters, cut something with
					white-handled knife, etc. Cords and scourge should be used at once.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - Consecrating Tools: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The tool should be kept in as close connection as possible to the naked body
					for at least a month, i.e., kept under pillow, etc. When not in use, all tools
					and weapons should be put away in a secret place; and it is good that this
					should be near your sleeping place, and that you handle them each night before
					retiring. Do not allow anyone to touch or handle any of your tools until they
					are thoroughly impregnated with your aura; say, six months or as near as
					possible. But a couple working together may own the same tools, which will be
					impregnated with the aura of both.

				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					The Law was made and Ardane of old. The law was made for the Wicca, to advise
					and help in their troubles. The Wicca should give due worship to the Gods and
					obey their will, which they Ardane, for it was made for the good of the Wicca,
					As the [5] Wicca's worship is good for the Gods, For the Gods love the Wicca.
					As a man loveth a woman, by mastering her, so the Wicca should love the Gods,
					by being mastered by them. And it is necessary that the Circle, which is the
					Temple of the Gods, should be truly cast and purified, that it [10] may be a
					fit place for the Gods to enter. And the Wicca should be properly prepared and
					purified, to enter into the presence of the Gods. With love and worship in
					their hearts they shall raise power from their bodies to give power to the
					Gods, as has been taught us of old, [15] For in this way only may man have
					communion with the Gods, for the Gods cannot help man without the help of men.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					And the High Priestess shall rule her Coven as representative of the Goddess,
					and the High Priest shall support her as the representative of the God, And the
					High Priestess shall choose whom she [20] will, if he have sufficient rank, to
					be her High Priest), For the God himself, kissed her feet in the fivefold
					salute, laying his power at the feet of the Goddess, because of her youth and
					beauty, her sweetness and kindness, her wisdom and Justice, her humility and
					generosity. So he resigned his lordship to her. But the Priestess should [25]
					ever mind that all power comes from him. It is only lent when it is used wisely
					and justly. And the greatest virtue of a High Priestess is that she recognizes
					that youth is necessary to the representative of the Goddess, so that she will
					retire gracefully in favour of a younger woman, Should the Coven so decide in
					Council, For the true [30] High Priestess realizes that gracefully surrendering
					pride of place is one of the greatest of virtues, and t hat thereby she will
					return to that pride of place in another life, with greater power and beauty.

				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					In the days when Witchdom extended far, we were free and worshipped in All
					their Greatest Temples, but in these unhappy times [35] we must hold our sacred
					mysteries in secret. So it be Ardane, that none but the Wicca may see our
					mysteries, for our enemies are many, And torture looseth the tongues of many.
					It be Ardane that each Coven shall not know where the next Coven bide, or who
					its members are, save the Priest and Priestess, [40] That there shall be no
					communication between them, save by the Messenger of the Gods, or the Summoner.
					Only if it be safe, may the Covens meet, in some safe place, for the great
					festivals. And while there, none shall say whence they come, or give their true
					names, to the end that, if any are tortured, in their agony, they can [45] not
					tell if they know not. So it be Ardane that no one may tell any not of the
					Craft who be of the Wicca, nor give any names, or where they bide, or in any
					way tell anything which can betray any to our foes, nor may they tell where the
					Covenstead be, or where is the Covendom, [50] or where be the meeting s or that
					there have been meetings. And if any break these laws, even under torture, The
					Curse of the Goddess shall be upon them, so they never reborn on earth, And may
					they remain where they belong, in the Hell of the Christians.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Let each High Priestess govern her Coven with Justice and [55] love, with the
					help of the advice of the elders, always heeding the advice of the Messenger of
					the Gods, if he cometh. She will heed all complaints of brothers, and strive to
					settle all differences among them, but it must be recognized that there be
					people who will ever strive to force others to do as they will. [60] They are
					not necessarily evil, and they often do have good ideas, and such ideas should
					be talked over in council. And if they will not agree with their brothers, or
					if they say, "I will not work under this High Priestess," it hath always been
					the old law to be convenient for the brethren, and to void disputes, any of the
					Third [65] may claim to found a new Coven because they live over a league from
					the Covenstead, or are about to do so. Anyone living within the Covendom
					wishing to form a new Coven, to avoid strife, shall tell the Elders of his
					intention and on the instant void his dwelling and remove to the new Covendom.
					Members of the old Coven may join the New one when it be formed, but if they
					do, must utterly void the old Coven. The Elders of the New and the Old Covens
					should meet in peace and brotherly love, to decide the new boundaries. Those of
					the Craft who dwell outside both Covendoms may join either indifferent, but not
					both, though all may, if the Elders [75] agree, meet for the Great Festivals,
					if it be truly in peace and brotherly love. But splitting the coven oft means
					strife, so for this reason these laws were made of old, And may the curse of
					the Goddess be on any who disregard them. So be it ardane.
				-

				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					If you would Keep a book let it be in your own hand of write. [80] Let brothers
					and sisters copy what they will, but never let the book out of your hands, and
					never keep the writings of another, for if it be found in their hand of write,
					they well may be taken and enjoined. Each should guard his own writings and
					destroy it whenever danger threatens. Learn as much as you may by heart, and
					when danger is [85] past, rewrite your book an it be safe. For this reason, if
					any die, destroy their book if they have not been able to, for an it be found,
					'tis clear proof against them, And our oppressors well know, "Ye may not be a
					witch alone" So all their kin and friends be in danger of torture. So ever
					destroy anything not necessary. [90] If your book be found on you. 'tis clear
					proof against you alone. You may be enjoined. Keep all thoughts of the Craft
					from your mind. Say you had bad dreams; a devil caused you to write it without
					your knowledge. Think to yourself, "I know nothing. I remember nothing. I have
					forgotten everything." Drive this [95] into your mind. If the torture be too
					great to bear, say, "I will confess. I cannot bear this torture. What do you
					want me to say? Tell me and I will say it." If they try to make you speak of
					the brotherhood, Do NOT, but if they try to make you speak of [100]
					impossibilities, such as flying through the air, consorting with the Christian
					Devil, or sacrificing children, or eating men's flesh, to obtain relief from
					torture, say, "I had an evil dream. I was not myself. I was crazed." Not all
					Magistrates are bad. If there [105] be an excuse they may show mercy. If you
					have confessed aught, deny it afterwards; say you babbled under torture, you
					knew not what you did or said. If you are condemned, fear not. The Brotherhood
					is powerful. They may help you to escape, if you stand steadfast, but if you
					betray aught, there is no hope for you, in this [110] life, or in that which is
					to come. Be sure, if steadfast you go to the pyre, Dwale will reach you. You
					will feel naught. You go but to o Death and what lies beyond, the ecstasy of
					the Goddess.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					'Tis probable that before you are enjoined, Dwale will reach you. [115] Always
					remember that Christians fear much that any die under torture. At the first
					sign of swoon, they cause it to be stopped, and blame the tormenters. For that
					reason, the tormenters themselves are apt to feign to torment, but do not, so
					it is best not to die at first. If Dwale reaches you, 'tis a sign that you have
					a friend somewhere. [120] You may be helped to escape, so despair not. If the
					worst comes, and you go to the pyre, wait till the flames and smoke spring up,
					bend your head over, and breath in with long breaths. You choke and die
					swiftly, and wake in the arms of the Goddess.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					To void discovery, let the working tools [125] be as ordinary things that any
					may have in their houses. Let the Pentacles be of wax, so they may be broken at
					once. Have no sword unless your rank allows you one. Have no names or signs on
					anything. Write the names and signs on them in ink before consecrating them and
					wash it off immediately after. Do not Bigrave them, [130] lest they cause
					discovery. Let the colour of the hilts tell which is which.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Ever remember, ye are the Hidden Children of the Gods. So never do anything to
					disgrace them. Never boast, Never threaten, Never say you would wish ill to
					anyone. If you or any not in the Circle speak of the Craft, [135] say, "Speak
					not to me of such. It frightens me. 'Tis evil luck to speak of it." For this
					reason: the Christians have spies everywhere. These speak as if they were well
					affected, as if they would come to Meetings, saying, "My mother used to go to
					worship the Old Ones. I would that I could go myself." 4 To these ever deny all
					knowledge. [140] But to others ever say, "'Tis foolish men talk of witches
					flying through the air; to do so they must be light as thistledown," and "Men
					say that witches all be bleared-eyed old crones, so what pleasure can there be
					in witch meetings such as folk talk on?" Say, "Many wise men now say there be
					no such creatures." Ever [145] make it a jest, and in some future time, perhaps
					the persecution will die, and we may worship safely again. Let us all pray for
					that happy day.

				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 9

				-
					May the blessings of the Goddess and the God be on all who keep these laws
					which are Ardane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					If the Craft hath any Appanage, let all brothers guard it, and help to keep it
					clear and good for the Craft, and let all justly guard all monies of the Craft.
					But if some brothers truly wrought it, 'tis right that they have their pay, an
					it be just, an this be not taking [5] money for the use of the Art, but for
					good and honest work. And even the Christians say, "A labourer is worthy of his
					hire." But if any brotherswillingly for the good of the craft without pay, 'tis
					but to their greater honour. So it be Ardane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					If there be any disputes or quarrels among the brethren, the [10] High
					Priestess shall straight convene the Elders and enquire into the matter, and
					they shall hear both sides, first alone, then together, and they shall decide
					justly, not favouring the one side or the other, ever recognizing that there be
					people who can never agree to work under others, but at the same time there be
					some people who [15] cannot rule justly. To those who ever must be chief, there
					is one answer, "Void the Coven and seek an other, or make a Coven of your own,
					taking with you those who will to go." To those who cannot rule justly, the
					answer be, "Those who cannot bear your rule will leave you," for none may come
					to meetings with those with whom they are at [20] variance; so, an either
					cannot agree, get hence, for the Craft must ever survive. So it be Ardane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					In the olden days when we had power, we could use our Arts against any who
					ill-treated any of the Brotherhood, but in these evil times, we may not do so,
					for our enemies have devised a burning [25] pit of everlasting fire, into which
					they say their God casteth all the people who worship him, except it be the
					very few who are released by their priests' spells and Masses, and this be
					chiefly by giving money and rich gifts to receive his favour, for their Alther
					Greatest God [Greatest God of all] is ever i n need of Money. [30] But as our
					Gods need our aid to make fertility for men and crops, So the God of the
					Christians is ever in need of man's help to search out and destroy us. Their
					priests tell them that any who get our help or our cures are damned to the Hell
					forever, so men be mad for the terror of it. But they make men [35] believe
					that they may scape this hell if they give victims to the tormenters. So for
					this reason all be forever spying, thinking, "An I can but catch one of the
					Wicca I will scape this fiery pit." But we have our hidels, and men searching
					long and not finding say, "there be none, or if they be, they be in a far
					country." [40] But when one of our oppressors die, or even be sick, ever is the
					cry, "This be Witches Malice," and the hunt is up again. And though they slay
					ten of their people to one of ours, still they care not; they have many
					thousands, while we are few indeed. So it is Ardane that none shall use the Art
					in any way to do ill [45] to any, howevermuch they have injured us. And for
					long we have obeyed this law, "Harm none" and nowtimes many believe we exist
					not. So it be Ardane that this law shall still continue to help us in our
					plight. No one, however great an injury or injustice they receive, may use the
					Art in any to do ill or harm any. [50] But they may, after great consultations
					with all, use the Art to prevent or restrain Christians from harming us and
					others, but only to let or constrain them and never to punish, to this end. Men
					say, "Such an one is a mighty searcher out and persecutor of Old Women whom he
					deemeth to be Witches, [55] and none hath done him Skith [harm], so this be
					proof they cannot, o r more truly, that there be none," For all know full well
					that so many folk have died because someone had a grudge against them, or were
					persecuted because they had money or goods to seize, or because they had none
					to bribe the searchers. And many have died [60] because they were scolding old
					women, so much so that men now say that only old women are witches, and this be
					to our advantage, and turns suspicion away from us. In England 'tis now many a
					year since a witch hath died the death, but any misuse of the power might raise
					the Persecution again; so never break this law, [65] however much you are
					tempted, and never consent to its being broken. If you know it is being broken
					in the least, you must work strongly against it, and any High Priestess or High
					Priest who consents to it must be immediately deposed, for 'tis the blood of
					the Brethren they endanger. Do good, an it be safe, and only if [70] it be
					safe, for any talk may endanger us.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					And strictly keep to the Old Law, never accept money for the use of the art. It
					is Christian priests and sorcerers who accept money for the use of their Arts,
					and they sell Dwale and evil love spells and pardons to let men scape from
					their sins. [75] Be not as these. Be not as these. If you accept not money, you
					will be free of temptation to use the Art for evil causes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					You may use the Art for your own advantage, or for the advantage of the Craft,
					only if you be sure you harm none. But ever let the Coven debate the matter at
					length. Only if all are satisfied that none may be harmed [80] may the Art be
					used. If it is not possible to achieve your ends one way without harming any,
					perchance the aim may be achieved by acting in a different way, so as to harm
					none. May the Curse of the Goddess be on any who breach this law. So it be
					Aredane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					'Tis adjudged lawful an anyone need a house or land, an none will [85] sell, to
					incline the owner's mind to be willing to sell, provided it harmeth him not in
					any way, and that the full worth is paid, without haggling. Never bargain or
					cheapen anything which you buy by the Art. So it be Ardane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					It is the Old Law and the most important of all Laws [90] that no one may do or
					say anything which will endanger any of the Craft, or bring them in contact
					with the law of the land, or the Law of the Church or any of our persecutors.
					In any disputes between the brethren, no one may invoke any laws but those of
					the Craft, or any Tribunal but that of the Priestess and the Priest and the
					[95] Elders. And may the Curse of the Goddess be on any who so do. So it be
					Ardane.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Old Laws: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					It is not forbidden to say as Christians do, "There be Witchcraft in the Land,"
					because our oppressors of old made it Heresy not to believe in Witchcraft, and
					so a crime to deny it, which thereby put [100] you under suspicion. But ever
					say "I know not of it here, perchance they may be, but afar off. I know not
					where." But ever speak so you cause others to doubt they be as they are. Always
					speak of them as old crones, consorting with the Devil and riding through the
					air. But ever say, "But how may men ride through the air an they be not [105]
					as light as thistledown?" But the curse of the Goddess be on any who cast any
					suspicion on any of the Brotherhood, or speaks of any real meeting place, or
					where any bide. So it be Ardane. [R] Let the Craft keep books with the names of
					all Herbs which are good for man, and all cures, that all may learn. But keep
					[110] another book with all the Banes [poisons] and Apies. and let only the
					elders and trustworthy people have this knowledge. So it be Ardane. [S] And may
					the Blessings of the Gods be on all who keep these Laws and the Curses of both
					God and Goddess be on all who break them So it be Ardane. [The following two
					sections were added after 1960.] [T] Remember the Art is the secret of the Gods
					and may only be used in earnest and never for show or vainglory. Magicians and
					Christians may taunt us, saying, "You have no power. Do magic before our eyes.
					Then only will we believe," seeking to cause us to betray our Art before them.
					Heed them not, for the Art is holy, and may only be used in need. And the curse
					of the Gods be on any who break this law. [U] It ever be the way with women,
					and with men also, that they ever seek new love, nor should we reprove them for
					this, but it may be found to disadvantage the Craft, as so many a time it has
					happened that a High Priest or High Priestess, impelled by love, hath departed
					with their love; that is, they have left the coven. Now, if a High Priestess
					wishes to resign, she may do so in full Coven, and this resignation is valid.
					But if they should run off without resigning, who may know if they may not
					return w within a few months? So the law is, if a High Priestess leaves her
					coven, but returns within the space of a year and a day, then she shall be
					taken back, and all shall be as before. Meanwhile, if she has a deputy, that
					deputy shall act as High Priestess for as long as the High Priestess is away.
					If she returns not at the end of a year and a day, then shall the coven elect a
					new High Priestess. Unless there be a good reason to the contrary. The person
					who has done the work should reap the benefit of the reward, Maiden and deputy
					of the High Priestess.
