					Chapter 1: Section 1: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						On an evening before Easter Day, I sat at a table, and having (as my custom
						was) in my humble prayer sufficiently conversed with my Creator, and
						considered many great mysteries (whereof the Father of Lights his Majesty
						had shown me not a few) and being now ready to prepare in my heart,
						together with my dear Paschal Lamb, a small, unleavened, undefiled cake;
						all of a sudden arose so horrible a tempest, that I imagined no other but
						that through its mighty force, the hill on which my little house was
						founded would fly into pieces.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 1: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						But inasmuch as this, and the like from the Devil (who had done me many a
						spite) was no new thing to me, I took courage, and persisted in my
						meditation, till somebody in an unusual manner touched me on the back;
						whereupon I was so hugely terrified, that I dared hardly look about me; yet
						I showed myself as cheerful as (in such occurrences) human frailty would
						permit. Now the same thing still twitching me several times by the coat, I
						looked back, and behold it was a fair and glorious lady, whose garments
						were all sky-coloured, and curiously (like Heaven) bespangled with golden
						stars; in her right hand she bore a trumpet of beaten gold, on which a Name
						was engraved which I could well read but am as yet forbidden to reveal it.
						In her left hand she had a great bundle of letters of all languages, which
						she (as I afterwards understood) was to carry to all countries. She also
						had large and beautiful wings, full of eyes throughout, with which she
						could mount aloft, and fly swifter than any eagle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 1: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						I might perhaps have been able to take further notice of her, but because
						she stayed so little time with me, and terror and amazement still possessed
						me, I had to be content. For as soon as I turned about, she turned her
						letters over and over, and at length drew out a small one, which with great
						reverence she laid down upon the table, and without giving one word,
						departed from me. But in her mounting upward, she gave so mighty a blast on
						her gallant trumpet, that the whole hill echoed from it, and for a full
						quarter of an hour after, I could hardly hear my own words.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 1: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						In so unlooked for an adventure I was at a loss, how either to advise or to
						assist my poor self, and therefore fell upon my knees and besought my
						Creator to permit nothing contrary to my eternal happiness to befall me.
						Whereupon with fear and trembling, I went to the letter, which was now so
						heavy, that had it been mere gold it could hardly have been so weighty. Now
						as I was diligently viewing it, I found a little seal, on which a curious
						cross with this inscription, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, was engraved.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 1: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Now as soon as I espied this sign I was the more comforted, as not being
						ignorant that such a seal was little acceptable, and much less useful, to
						the Devil. Whereupon I tenderly opened the letter, and within it, in an
						azure field, in golden letters, found the following verses written.

					Chapter 1: Section 2: Paragraph 1

						This day, today

						For this thou wast born

						Below was written: Sponsus and Sponsa.

					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						As soon as I had read this letter, I was presently like to have fainted
						away, all my hair stood on end, and a cold sweat tricked down my whole
						body. For although I well perceived that this was the appointed wedding, of
						which seven years before I was acquainted in a bodily vision, and which now
						for so long a time I had with great earnestness awaited, and which lastly,
						by the account and calculation of the planets, I had most diligently
						observed, I found so to be, yet could I never foresee that it must happen
						under such grievous perilous conditions. For whereas I before imagined,
						that to be a welcome and acceptable guest, I needed only to be ready to
						appear at the wedding, I was now directed to Divine Providence, of which
						until this time I was never certain.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						I also found by myself, the more I examined my self, that in my head there
						was nothing but gross misunderstanding, and blindness in mysterious things,
						so that I was not able to comprehend even those things which lay under my
						feet, and which I daily conversed with, much less that I should be born to
						the searching out and understanding of the secrets of Nature, since in my
						opinion Nature might everywhere find a more virtuous disciple, to whom to
						entrust her precious, though temporary and changeable, treasures.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						I found also that my bodily behaviour, and outward good conversation, and
						brotherly love towards my neighbour, was not duly purged and cleansed.
						Moreover the tickling of the flesh manifested itself, whose affection was
						bent only to pomp and bravery, and worldly pride, and not to the good of
						mankind: and I was always contriving how by this art I might in a short
						time abundantly increase my profit and advantage, rear up stately palaces,
						make myself an everlasting name in the world, and other similar carnal
						designs. But the obscure words concerning the three temples particularly
						afflicted me, which I was not able to make out by any after-speculation,
						and perhaps should not have done so yet, had they not been wonderfully
						revealed to me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						Thus stuck between hope and fear, examining my self again and again, and
						finding only my own frailty and impotence, not being in any way able to
						succour myself, and exceedingly amazed at the forementioned threatening, at
						length I betook myself to my usual and most secure course - after I had
						finished my earnest and most fervent prayer, I laid myself down in my bed,
						so that perchance my good angel by the Divine permission might appear, and
						(as it had sometimes formerly happened) instruct me in this doubtful
						affair. Which to the praise of God, my own good, and my neighbours'
						faithful and hearty warning and amendment, did now likewise come about.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						For I was yet scarcely fallen asleep, when I thought that I, together with
						an innumerable multitude of men, lay fettered with great chains in a dark
						dungeon, in which, without the least glimpse of light, we swarmed like bees
						one over another, and thus rendered each other's affliction more grievous.
						But although neither I nor any of the rest could see one jot, yet I
						continually heard one heaving himself above the other, when his chains and
						fetters had become ever so slightly lighter, though none of us had much
						reason to shove up above the other, since we were all captive wretches.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Now when I with the rest had continued a good while in this affliction, and
						each was still reproaching the other with his blindness and captivity, at
						length we heard many trumpets sounding together and kettle drums beating in
						such a masterly fashion, that it even revived us in our calamity and made
						us rejoice. During this noise the cover of the dungeon was lifted up from
						above, and a little light let down to us. Then first might truly have been
						discerned the bustle we kept, for all went pell-mell, and he who perchance
						had heaved himself up too much, was forced down again under the others'
						feet. In brief, each one strove to be uppermost. Neither did I myself
						linger, but with my weighty fetters slipped up from under the rest, and
						then heaved myself upon a stone, which I laid hold of; howbeit, I was
						caught at several times by others, from whom yet as well as I might, I
						still guarded myself with hands and feet. For we imagined no other but that
						we should all be set at liberty, which yet fell out quite otherwise.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 4: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						For after the nobles who looked upon us from above through the hole had
						recreated themselves a while with our struggling and lamenting, a certain
						hoary-headed ancient man called to us to be quiet, and having scarcely
						obtained this, began (as I still remember) to speak on thus:
					-
			-
				Chapter 1: Section 5
			-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						If the poor human race
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Were not so arrogant
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						It would have been given much good
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						From my mother's heritage,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						But because the human race will not take heed
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						It lies in such straits
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						And must be held in prison.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						And yet my dearest mother
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Will not regard their mischief,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						She leaves her lovely gifts
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						That many a man might come to the light,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						Though this may chance but seldom
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						That they be better prized
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 5: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						Nor reckoned as mere fable.
					-
			-
				Chapter 1: Section 6
			-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						Therefore in honour of the feast
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Which we shall hold today,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						That her grace may be multiplied
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						A good work will she do:
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						The rope will now be lowered
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Whoever may hang on to it
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 6: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						He shall be freed.

						He had scarcely finished speaking when an ancient matron commanded her
						servants to let down the cord seven times into the dungeon, and draw up
						whosoever could hang upon it. Good God! that I could sufficiently describe
						the hurry and disquiet that then arose amongst us; for everyone strove to
						get to the cord, and yet only hindered each other. But after seven minutes
						a sign was given by a little bell, whereupon at the first pull the servants
						drew up four. At that time I could not get very near the cord, having (as
						is beforementioned) to my huge misfortune, betaken myself to a stone at the
						wall of the dungeon; and thereby I was made unable to get to the cord which
						descended in the middle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 7: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						The cord was let down the second time, but many, because their chains were
						too heavy, and their hands too tender, could not keep their hold on the
						cord, but with themselves beat down many another who else perhaps might
						have held fast enough; nay, many a one was forcibly pulled off by another,
						who yet could not himself get at it, so mutually envious were we even in
						this our great misery. But they of all others most moved my compassion
						whose weight was so heavy that they tore their very hands from their
						bodies, and yet could not get up. Thus it came to pass that at those five
						times very few were drawn up. For as soon as the sign was given, the
						servants were so nimble at drawing the cord up, that the most part tumbled
						one upon another, and the cord, this time especially, was drawn up very
						empty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 7: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Whereupon the greatest part, and even I myself, despaired of redemption,
						and called upon God that he would have pity on us, and (if possible)
						deliver us out of this obscurity; who then also heard some of us. For when
						the cord came down the sixth time, some of them hung themselves fast upon
						it; and whilst being drawn up, the cord swung from one side to the other,
						and (perhaps by the will of God) came to me, and I suddenly caught it,
						uppermost above all the rest, and so at length beyond hope came out. At
						which I rejoiced exceedingly, so that I did not perceive the wound which
						during the drawing up I had received on my head from a sharp stone, until
						I, with the rest who were released (as was always done before) had to help
						with the seventh and last pull; at which time through straining, the blood
						ran down all over my clothes, which I nevertheless because of my joy did
						not take notice of. Now when the last drawing up on which the most of all
						hung was finished, the matron caused the cord to be laid aside, and asked
						her aged son to declare her resolution to the rest of the prisoners, who
						after he had thought a little spoke thus unto them.

						The great favour which my mother

				-
					-
						No one be poor or rich,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						And who was given great commands
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						Must bring much with him now,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						And who was much entrusted with
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						Stripped to the skin will be,
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						Wherefore leave off your lamentation
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 8: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						Which is but for a few days.

				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						As soon as he had finished these words, the cover was again put to and
						locked down, and the trumpets and kettle-drums began afresh, yet the noise
						of them could not be so loud but that the bitter lamentation of the
						prisoners which arose in the dungeon was heard above all, which soon also
						caused my eyes to run over.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Presently afterwards the ancient matron, together with her son, sat down on
						seats before prepared, and commanded the redeemed should be told. Now as
						soon as she had demanded everyone's name, which were also written down by a
						little page; having viewed us all, one after another, she sighed, and spoke
						to her son, so that I could well hear her, "Ah, how heartily I am grieved
						for the poor men in the dungeon! I would to God I could release them all."
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						To which her son replied, "It is, mother, thus ordained by God, against
						whom we may not contend. If we were all of us lords, and possessed all the
						goods upon Earth, and were seated at table, who would there then be to
						bring up the service?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						Whereupon his mother held her peace, but soon after she said, "Well,
						however, let these be freed from their fetters," which was likewise
						presently done, and I was the last except a few; yet I could not refrain
						(though I still looked upon the rest) but bowed myself before the ancient
						matron, and thanked God that through her, he had graciously and fatherly
						vouchsafed to bring me out of such darkness into the light. After me the
						rest did likewise, to the satisfaction of the matron.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Lastly, to everyone was given a piece of gold for a remembrance, and to
						spend by the way, on the one side of which was stamped the rising sun, and
						on the other (as I remember) these three letters, D.L.S.; and therewith
						everyone had license to depart, and was sent to his own business with this
						annexed limitation, that we to the glory of God should benefit our
						neighbours, and reserve in silence what we had been entrusted with; which
						we also promised to do, and so departed one from another. But because of
						the wounds which the fetters had caused me, I could not well go forward,
						but halted on both feet, which the matron presently espying, laughing at
						it, and calling me again to her said thus to me: "My son, do not let this
						defect afflict you, but call to mind your infirmities, and therewith thank
						God who has permitted you even in this world, and in your state of
						imperfection, to come into so high a light; and keep these wounds for my
						sake."
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Whereupon the trumpets began to sound again, which gave me such a shock
						that I woke up, and then first perceived that it was only a dream, but it
						so strongly impressed my imagination that I was still perpetually troubled
						about it, and I thought I still felt the wounds on my feet. Howbeit, by all
						these things I understood well that God had vouchsafed that I should be
						present at this mysterious and bidden wedding. Wherefore with childlike
						confidence I returned thanks to his Divine Majesty, and besought him that
						he would further preserve me in fear of him, that he would daily fill my
						heart with wisdom and understanding, and at length graciously (without
						deserting me) conduct me to the desired end.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Hereupon I prepared myself for the way, put on my white linen coat, girded
						my loins, with a blood-red ribbon bound cross-ways over my shoulder. In my
						hat I stuck four red roses, so that I might sooner be noticed amongst the
						throng by this token. For food I took bread, salt and water, which by the
						counsel of an understanding person I had at certain times used, not without
						profit, in similar occurrences.
					-
				-
					Chapter 1: Section 9: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						But before I left my cottage, I first, in this my dress and wedding
						garment, fell down upon my knees, and besought God that in case such a
						thing were, he would vouchsafe me a good issue. And thereupon in the
						presence of God I made a vow that if anything through his grace should be
						revealed to me, I would employ it to neither my own honour nor my own
						authority in the world, but to the spreading of his Name, and the service
						of my neighbour. And with this vow, and good hope, I departed out of my
						cell with joy.

						I had hardly got out of my cell into a forest when I thought the whole
						heaven and all the elements had already trimmed themselves in preparation
						for this wedding. For even the birds chanted more pleasantly than before,
						and the young fawns skipped so merrily that they made my heart rejoice, and
						moved me to sing; wherefore with a loud voice I thus began:
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Section 2
			-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						Rejoice dear bird
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						And praise thy Maker,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Raise bright and clear thy voice,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						Thy God is most exalted,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Thy food he hath prepared for thee
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						To give thee in due season.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						So be content therewith,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						Wherefore shalt thou not be glad,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Wilt thou arraign thy God
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						That he hath made thee bird?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						Wilt trouble thy wee head
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						That he made thee not a man?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Be still, he hath it well bethought
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						And be content therewith.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						What do I then, a worm of earth
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						To judge along with God?
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						That I in this heaven's storm
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						Do wrestle with all art.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						Thou canst not fight with God.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						And whoso is not fit for this, let him be sped away
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 21
				-
					-
						O Man, be satisfied
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 22
				-
					-
						That he hath made thee not the King
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						And take it not amiss,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						Perchance hadst thou despised his name,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 25
				-
					-
						That were a sorry matter:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 26
				-
					-
						For God hath clearer eyes that that
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 27
				-
					-
						He looks into thy heart,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 2: Paragraph 28
				-
					-
						Thou canst not God deceive.

						This I sang now from the bottom of my heart throughout the whole forest, so
						that it resounded from all parts, and the hills repeated my last words,
						until at length I saw a curious green heath, to which I betook myself out
						of the forest. Upon this heath stood three lovely tall cedars, which by
						reason of their breadth afforded excellent and desired shade, at which I
						greatly rejoiced. For although I had not hitherto gone far, yet my earnest
						longing made me very faint, whereupon I hastened to the trees to rest a
						little under them. But as soon as I came somewhat closer, I saw a tablet
						fastened to one of them, on which (as afterwards I read) in curious letters
						the following words were written:

						"God save you, stranger! If you have heard anything concerning the nuptials
						of the King, consider these words. By us the Bridegroom offers you a choice
						between four ways, all of which, if you do not sink down in the way, can
						bring you to his royal court. The first is short but dangerous, and one
						which will lead you into rocky places, through which it will scarcely be
						possible to pass. The second is longer, and takes you circuitously; it is
						plain and easy, if by the help of the Magnet you turn neither to left nor
						right. The third is that truly royal way which through various pleasures
						and pageants of our King, affords you a joyful journey; but this so far has
						scarcely been allotted to one in a thousand. By the fourth no man shall
						reach the place, because it is a consuming way, practicable only for
						incorruptible bodies. Choose now which one you will of the three, and
						persevere constantly therein, for know whichever you will enter, that is
						the one destined for you by immutable Fate, nor can you go back in it save
						at great peril to life. These are the things which we would have you know.
						But, ho, beware! you know not with how much danger you commit yourself to
						this way, for if you know yourself to be obnoxious by the smallest fault to
						the laws of our King, I beseech you, while it is still possible, to return
						swiftly to your house by the way you came."

					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						As soon as I read this writing all my joy nearly vanished again, and I who
						before sang merrily, began now inwardly to lament. For although I saw all
						the three ways before me, and understood that henceforward it was
						vouchsafed to me to choose one of them, yet it troubled me that if I went
						the stony and rocky way, I might get a miserable and deadly fall, or if I
						took the long one, I might wander out of it through byways, or be in other
						ways detained in the great journey. Neither could I hope that I amongst
						thousands should be the very one who should choose the royal way. I saw
						likewise the fourth before me, but it was so environed with fire and
						exaltations, that I did not dare draw near it by much, and therefore again
						and again considered whether I should turn back, or take any of the ways
						before me. I considered well my own unworthiness, but the dream still
						comforted me that I was delivered out of the tower; and yet I did not dare
						confidently rely upon a dream; whereupon I was so perplexed in various
						ways, that very great weariness, hunger and thirst seized me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Whereupon I presently drew out my bread and cut a slice of it; which a
						snow-white dove of whom I was not aware, sitting upon the tree, saw, and
						therewith (perhaps according to her usual manner) came down. She betook
						herself very familiarly with me, and I willingly imparted my food to her,
						which she received, and so with her prettiness she again refreshed me a
						little. But as soon as her enemy, a most black raven, perceived it, he
						straightaway darted down upon the dove, and taking no notice of me, would
						force away the dove's food, and she could not guard herself otherwise than
						by flight. Whereupon they both flew together towards the south, at which I
						was so hugely incensed and grieved that without thinking what I did, I
						hastened after the filthy raven, and so against my will ran into one of the
						forementioned ways a whole field's length. And thus the raven having been
						chased away, and the dove delivered, I then first observed what I had
						inconsiderately done, and that I was already entered into a way, from which
						under peril of great punishment I could not retire. And though I had still
						wherewith in some measure to comfort myself, yet that which was worst of
						all to me was that I had left my bag and bread at the tree, and could never
						retrieve them. For as soon as I turned myself about, a contrary wind was so
						strong against me that it was ready to fell me. But if I went forward on
						the way, I perceived no hindrance at all. From which I could easily
						conclude that it would cost me my life if I should set myself against the
						wind, wherefore I patiently took up my cross, got up onto my feet, and
						resolved, since so it must be, that I would use my utmost endeavour to get
						to my journey's end before night.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Now although many apparent byways showed themselves, yet I still proceeded
						with my compass, and would not budge one step from the Meridian Line;
						howbeit the way was often so rugged and impassable, that I was in no little
						doubt of it. On this way I constantly thought upon the dove and the raven,
						and yet could not search out the meaning; until at length upon a high hill
						afar off I saw a stately portal, to which, not regarding how far it was
						distant both from me and from the way I was on, I hasted, because the sun
						had already hid himself under the hills, and I could see no abiding place
						elsewhere; and this verily I ascribe only to God, who might well have
						permitted me to go forward in this way, and withheld my eyes that so I
						might have gazed beside this gate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						To this I now made great haste, and reached it in so much daylight as to
						take a very competent view of it. Now it was an exceedingly royal beautiful
						portal, on which were carved a multitude of most noble figures and devices,
						every one of which (as I afterwards learned) had its peculiar
						signification. Above was fixed a pretty large tablet, with these words,
						"Procul hinc, procul ite profani" ("keep away, you who are profane"), and
						other things more, that I was earnestly forbidden to relate.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Now as soon as I came under the portal, there straightaway stepped forth
						one in a sky-coloured habit, whom I saluted in a friendly manner; and
						though he thankfully returned this salute, yet he instantly demanded of me
						my letter of invitation. O how glad was I that I had then brought it with
						me! For how easily might I have forgotten it (as it also chanced to others)
						as he himself told me! I quickly presented it, wherewith he was not only
						satisfied, but (at which I much wondered) showed me abundance of respect,
						saying, "Come in my brother, you are an acceptable guest to me"; and
						entreated me not to withhold my name from him. Now I having replied that I
						was a Brother of the Red-Rosy Cross, he both wondered and seemed to rejoice
						at it, and then proceeded thus: "My brother, have you nothing about you
						with which to purchase a token?" I answered that my ability was small, but
						if he saw anything about me he had a mind to, it was at his service. Now he
						having requested of me my bottle of water, and I having granted it, he gave
						me a golden token on which stood no more than these two letters, S.C.,
						entreating me that when it stood me in good stead, I would remember him.
						After which I asked him how many had come in before me, which he also told
						me, and lastly out of mere friendship gave me a sealed letter to the second
						Porter.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Now having lingered some time with him, the night grew on. Whereupon a
						great beacon upon the gates was immediately fired, so that if any were
						still upon the way, he might make haste thither. But the way, where it
						finished at the castle, was enclosed on both sides with walls, and planted
						with all sorts of excellent fruit trees, and on every third tree on each
						side lanterns were hung up, in which all the candles were lighted with a
						glorious touch by a beautiful Virgin, dressed in sky-colour, which was so
						noble and majestic a spectacle that I yet delayed somewhat longer than was
						requisite. But at length after sufficient information, and an advantageous
						instruction, I departed friendlily from the first Porter.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						On the way, I would gladly have known what was written in my letter, yet
						since I had no reason to mistrust the Porter, I forbare my purpose, and so
						went on the way, until I came likewise to the second gate, which though it
						was very like the other, yet it was adorned with images and mystic
						significations. On the affixed tablet was "Date et dabitur vobis" ("give
						and it shall be given unto you"). Under this gate lay a terrible grim lion
						chained, who as soon as he saw me arose and made at me with great roaring;
						whereupon the second Porter who lay upon a stone of marble woke up, and
						asked me not to be troubled or afraid, and then drove back the lion; and
						having received the latter which I gave him with trembling, he read it, and
						with very great respect said thus to me: "Now welcome in God's Name to me
						the man who for a long time I would gladly have seen." Meanwhile he also
						drew out a token and asked me whether I could purchase it. But having
						nothing else left but my salt, I presented it to him, which he thankfully
						accepted. Upon this token again stood only two letters, namely, S.M.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						I was just about to enter into discourse with him, when it began to ring in
						the castle, whereupon the Porter counseled me to run, or else all the pains
						and labour I had hitherto undergone would serve to no purpose, for the
						lights above were already beginning to be extinguished. Whereupon I went
						with such haste that I did not heed the Porter, I was in such anguish; and
						truly it was necessary, for I could not run so fast but that the Virgin,
						after whom all the lights were put out, was at my heels, and I should never
						have found the way, had she not given me some light with her torch. I was
						moreover constrained to enter right next to her, and the gate was suddenly
						clapped to, so that a part of my coat was locked out, which I was verily
						forced to leave behind me. For neither I, nor they who stood ready without
						and called at the gate, could prevail with the Porter to open it again, but
						he delivered the keys to the Virgin, who took them with her into the court.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Meanwhile I again surveyed the gate, which now appeared so rich that the
						whole world could not equal it. Just by the door were two columns, on one
						of which stood a pleasant figure with this inscription, "Congratulor". The
						other, which had its countenance veiled, was sad, and beneath was written,
						"Condoleo". In brief, the inscriptions and figures were so dark and
						mysterious that the most dextrous man on earth could not have expounded
						them. But all these (if God permits) I shall before long publish and
						explain.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Under this gate I was again to give my name, which was this last time
						written down in a little vellum book, and immediately with the rest
						despatched to the Lord Bridegroom. It was here where I first received the
						true guest token, which was somewhat smaller than the former, but yet much
						heavier. Upon this stood these letters, S.P.N. Besides this, a new pair of
						shoes were given me, for the floor of the castle was laid with pure shining
						marble. My old shoes I was to give away to one of the poor who sat in
						throngs, although in very good order, under the gate. I then bestowed them
						upon an old man, after which two pages with as many torches conducted me
						into a little room.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						There they asked me to sit down on a form, which I did, but they, sticking
						their torches in two holes, made in the pavement, departed and thus left me
						sitting alone. Soon after I heard a noise, but saw nothing, and it proved
						to be certain men who stumbled in upon me; but since I could see nothing, I
						had to suffer, and wait to see what they would do with me. But presently
						perceiving them to be barbers, I entreated them not to jostle me so, for I
						was content to do whatever they desired; whereupon they quickly let me go,
						and so one of them (whom I could not yet see) finely and gently cut away
						the hair round about from the crown of my head, but over my forehead, ears
						and eyes he permitted my ice-grey locks to hang. In this first encounter (I
						must confess) I was ready to despair, for inasmuch as some of them shoved
						me so forcefully, and yet I could see nothing, I could think nothing other
						but that God for my curiosity had suffered me to miscarry. Now these
						invisible barbers carefully gathered up the hair which was cut off, and
						carried it away with them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						After which the two pages entered again, and heartily laughed at me for
						being so terrified. But they had scarcely spoken a few words with me when
						again a little bell began to ring, which (as the pages informed me) was to
						give notice for assembling. Whereupon they asked me to rise, and through
						many walks, doors and winding stairs lit my way into a spacious hall. In
						this room was a great multitude of guests, emperors, kings, princes, and
						lords, noble and ignoble, rich and poor, and all sorts of people, at which
						I greatly marvelled, and thought to myself, 'ah, how gross a fool you have
						been to engage upon this journey with so much bitterness and toil, when
						(behold) here are even those fellows whom you know well, and yet never had
						any reason to esteem. They are now all here, and you with all your prayers
						and supplications have hardly got in at last'. This and more the Devil at
						that time injected, while I notwithstanding (as well as I could) directed
						myself to the issue.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Meanwhile one or other of my acquaintance here and there spoke to me: "Oh
						Brother Rosencreutz! Are you here too?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						"Yes (my brethren)," I replied, "the grace of God has helped me in too".
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						At which they raised mighty laughter, looking upon it as ridiculous that
						there should be need of God in so slight an occasion. Now having demanded
						each of them concerning his way, and finding that most of them were forced
						to clamber over the rocks, certain trumpets (none of which we yet saw)
						began to sound to the table, whereupon they all seated themselves, every
						one as he judged himself above the rest; so that for me and some other
						sorry fellows there was hardly a little nook left at the lowermost table.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						Presently the two pages entered, and one of them said grace in so handsome
						and excellent a manner, that it made the very heart in my body rejoice.
						However, certain great Sr John's made but little reckoning of them, but
						jeered and winked at one another, biting their lips within their hats, and
						using other similar unseemly gestures. After this, meat was brought in, and
						although no one could be seen, yet everything was so orderly managed, that
						it seemed to me as if every guest had his own attendant. Now my artists
						having somewhat recreated themselves, and the wine having removed a little
						shame from their hearts, they presently began to vaunt and brag of their
						abilities. One would prove this, another that, and commonly the most sorry
						idiots made the loudest noise. Ah, when I call to mind what preternatural
						and impossible enterprises I then heard, I am still ready to vomit at it.
						In a word, they never kept in their order, but whenever one rascal here,
						another there, could insinuate himself in between the nobles, then they
						pretended to having finished such adventures as neither Samson nor yet
						Hercules with all their strength could ever have achieved: this one would
						discharge Atlas of his burden; the other would again draw forth the
						three-headed Cerberus out of Hell. In brief, every man had his own prate,
						and yet the greatest lords were so simple that they believed their
						pretences, and the rogues so audacious, that although one or other of them
						was here and there rapped over the fingers with a knife, yet they flinched
						not at it, but when anyone perchance had filched a gold-chain, then they
						would all hazard for the same.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						I saw one who heard the rustling of the heavens. The second could see
						Plato's Ideas. A third could number Democritus's atoms. There were also not
						a few pretenders to the perpetual motion. Many a one (in my opinion) had
						good understanding, but assumed too much to himself, to his own
						destruction. Lastly, there was one also who found it necessary to persuade
						us out of hand that he saw the servitors who attended us, and would have
						persuaded us as to his contention, had not one of these invisible waiters
						reached him such a handsome cuff upon his lying muzzle, that not only he,
						but many more who were by him, became as mute as mice.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						But it pleased me most of all, that all those of whom I had any esteem were
						very quiet in their business, and made no loud cry of it, but acknowledged
						themselves to be misunderstanding men, to whom the mysteries of nature were
						too high, and they themselves much too small. In this tumult I had almost
						cursed the day when I came here; for I could not behold but with anguish
						that those lewd vain people were above at the board, but I in so sorry a
						place could not rest in quiet, one of those rascals scornfully reproaching
						me for a motley fool.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						Now I did not realise that there was still one gate through which we must
						pass, but imagined that during the whole wedding I was to continue in this
						scorn, contempt and indignity, which I had yet at no time deserved, either
						from the Lord Bridegroom or the Bride. And therefore (in my opinion) he
						should have done well to sort out some other fool than me to come to his
						wedding. Behold, to such impatience the iniquity of this world reduces
						simple hearts. But this really was one part of my lameness, of which (as is
						before mentioned) I dreamed. And truly the longer this clamour lasted, the
						more it increased. For there were already those who boasted of false and
						imaginary visions, and would persuade us of palpably lying dreams.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						Now there sat by me a very fine quiet man, who often discoursed of
						excellent matters. At length he said, "Behold my brother, if anyone should
						now come who were willing to instruct these blockish people in the right
						way, would he be heard?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 21
				-
					-
						"No, verily", I replied.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 22
				-
					-
						"The world," he said, "is now resolved (whatever comes of it) to be
						cheated, and cannot abide to give ear to those who intend its good. Do you
						see that same cocks-comb, with what whimsical figures and foolish conceits
						he allures others to him. There one makes mouths at the people with
						unheard-of mysterious words. Yet believe me in this, the time is now coming
						when those shameful vizards shall be plucked off, and all the world shall
						know what vagabond impostors were concealed behind them. Then perhaps that
						will be valued which at present is not esteemed."
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						Whilst he was speaking in this way, and the longer the clamour lasted the
						worse it was, all of a sudden there began in the hall such excellent and
						stately music such as I never heard all the days of my life; whereupon
						everyone held his peace, and waited to see what would become of it. Now in
						this music there were all the sorts of stringed instruments imaginable,
						which sounded together in such harmony that I forgot myself, and sat so
						immovable that those who sat by me were amazed at me; and this lasted
						nearly half an hour, during which time none of us spoke one word. For as
						soon as anyone at all was about to open his mouth, he got an unexpected
						blow, nor did he know where it came from. I thought since we were not
						permitted to see the musicians, I should have been glad to view just all
						the instruments they were using. After half an hour this music ceased
						unexpectedly, and we could neither see or hear anything more.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 5: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						Presently after, a great noise began before the door of the hall, with
						sounding and beating of trumpets, shalms and kettle-drums, as majestic as
						if the Emperor of Rome had been entering; whereupon the door opened by
						itself, and then the noise of the trumpets was so loud that we were hardly
						able to endure it. Meanwhile (to my thinking) many thousand small tapers
						came into the hall, all of which themselves marched in so very exact an
						order as altogether amazed us, till at last the two aforementioned pages
						with bright torches entered the hall, lighting the way of a most beautiful
						Virgin, all drawn on a gloriously gilded triumphant self-moving throne. It
						seemed to me that she was the very same who before on the way kindled and
						put out the lights, and that these attendants of hers were the very same
						whom she formerly placed at the trees. She was not now, as before, in
						sky-colour, but arrayed in a snow-white glittering robe, which sparkled
						with pure gold, and cast such a lustre that we could not steadily look at
						it. Both the pages were dressed in the same manner (although somewhat more
						modestly). As soon as they came into the middle of the hall, and had
						descended from the throne, all the small tapers made obeisance before her.
						Whereupon we all stood up from our benches, yet everyone stayed in his own
						place. Now she having showed to us, and we again to her, all respect and
						reverence, in a most pleasant tone she began to speak as follows:
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Section 6
			-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						The King, my gracious lord
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						He is not far away,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Nor is his dearest bride,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						Betrothed to him in honour.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						They have now with the greatest joy
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Beheld your coming hither.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Wherefore especially they would proffer
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						Their favour to each one of you,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						And they desire from their heart's depth
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						That ye at all times fare ye well,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						That ye have the coming wedding's joy
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 6: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						Unmixed with others' sorrow.
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Section 7
			-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 7: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						Hereupon with all her small tapers she courteously bowed again, and soon
						after began as follows:
					-
			-
				Chapter 2: Section 8
			-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						Ye know what in the invitation stands:
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						No man hath been called hither
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Who hath not got from God already
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						All gifts most beautiful,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						And hath himself adorned aright
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						As well befits him here,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Though some may not believe it,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						That any one so wayward be
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						That on such hard conditions
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Should dare to make appearance
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						When he hath not prepared himself
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						For this wedding long before.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						So now they stand in hope
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						That ye be well furnished with all good things,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						Be glad that in such hard times
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						So many folk be found
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						But men are yet so forward that
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						They care not for their boorishness
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						And thrust themselves in places where
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						They are not called to be.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 21

						Let no knave be smuggled in

						No rogue slip in with others.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						They will declare right openly
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						That they a wedding pure will have,
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 25
				-
					-
						So shall upon the morrow's morn
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 26
				-

						The artist's scales be set
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 27
				-
					-
						Wherein each one be weighed
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 28

						And found what he forgotten hath.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 29
				-
					-
						Of all the host assembled here

					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 30
				-
					-
						Who trusts him not in this
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 31
				-
					-
						Let him now stand aside.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 32
				-
					-
						And should he bide here longer
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 33
				-
					-
						Then he will lose all grace and favour
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 8: Paragraph 34
				-

						Be trodden underfoot,
					-

						And he whose conscience pricketh him
					-

						As soon as she had finished saying this, she again made reverence, and
						sprung cheerfully into her throne, after which the trumpets began to sound
						again, which yet was not forceful enough to take the grievous sighs away
						from many. So they conducted her invisibly away again, but most of the
						small tapers remained in the room, and one of them accompanied each of us.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 9: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						In such perturbation it is not really possible to express what pensive
						thoughts and gestures were among us. Yet most of us were resolved to await
						the scale, and in case things did not work out well, to depart (as they
						hoped) in peace. I had soon cast up my reckoning, and since my conscience
						convinced me of all ignorance, and unworthiness, I purposed to stay with
						the rest in the hall, and chose rather to content myself with the meal I
						had already taken, than to run the risk of a future repulse. Now after
						everyone had each been conducted into a chamber (each, as I since
						understood, into a particular one) by his small taper, there remained nine
						of us, and among the rest he who discoursed with me at the table too. But
						although our small tapers did not leave us, yet soon after an hour's time
						one of the aforementioned pages came in, and, bringing a great bundle of
						cords with him, first demanded of us whether we had concluded to stay
						there; when we had affirmed this with sighs, he bound each of us in a
						particular place, and so went away with our small tapers, and left us poor
						wretches in darkness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 9: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Then some first began to perceive the imminent danger, and I myself could
						not refrain from tears. For although we were not forbidden to speak, yet
						anguish and affliction allowed none of us to utter one word. For the cords
						were so wonderfully made that none could cut them, much less get them off
						his feet. Yet this comforted me, that still the future gain of many a one
						who had now taken himself to rest, would prove very little to his
						satisfaction. But we by only one night's penance might expiate all our
						presumption. Till at length in my sorrowful thoughts I fell asleep, during
						which I had a dream. Now although there is no great matter in it, yet I
						think it not impertinent to recount it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 9: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						I thought I was upon a high mountain, and saw before me a great and large
						valley. In this valley were gathered together an unspeakable multitude of
						people, each of which had at his head a thread, by which he was hanged from
						Heaven; now one hung high, another low, some stood even almost upon the
						earth. But through the air flew up and down an ancient man, who had in his
						hand a pair of shears, with which he cut here one's, there another's
						thread. Now he that was close to the earth was so much more ready, and fell
						without noise, but when it happened to one of the high ones, he fell so
						that the earth quaked. To some it came to pass that their thread was so
						stretched that they came to the earth before the thread was cut. I took
						pleasure in this tumbling, and it gave my heart joy, when he who had
						over-exalted himself in the air about his wedding got so shameful a fall
						that it even carried some of his neighbours along with him. In a similar
						way it also made me rejoice that he who had all this while kept himself
						near the earth could come down so finely and gently that even the men next
						to him did not perceive it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 2: Section 9: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						But being now in my highest fit of jollity, I was jogged unawares by one of
						my fellow captives, upon which I was awakened, and was very much
						discontented with him. However, I considered my dream, and recounted it to
						my brother, lying by me on the other side, who was not dissatisfied with
						it, but hoped that some comfort might be meant by it. In such discourse we
						spent the remaining part of the night, and with longing awaited the day.

						Now as soon as the lovely day was broken, and the bright Sun, having raised
						himself above the hills, had again took himself to his appointed office in
						the high Heaven, my good champions began to rise out of their beds, and
						leisurely to make themselves ready for the Inquisition. Whereupon, one
						after another, they came again into the hall, and saying good morning,
						demanded how we had slept that night; and having seen our bonds, there were
						some that reproved us for being so cowardly, and because we had not,
						rather, like them, hazarded upon all adventures. However, some of them
						whose hearts still smote them made no loud cry of the business. We excused
						ourselves with our ignorance, hoping we should now soon be set at liberty,
						and learn wisdom by this disgrace, that they on the contrary had not yet
						altogether escaped; and perhaps their greatest danger was still to come.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 1: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						At length everyone being assembled again, the trumpets began again to sound
						and the kettle drums to beat as formerly, and we then imagined nothing
						other but that the Bridegroom was ready to present himself; which
						nevertheless was a huge mistake. For it was again the Virgin of yesterday,
						who had arrayed herself all in red velvet, and girded herself with a white
						scarf. On her head she had a green wreath of laurel, which greatly suited
						her. Her train was now no more of small tapers, but consisted of two
						hundred men in armour, who were all (like her) clothed in red and white.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 1: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Now as soon as they were alighted from the throne, she came straight to us
						prisoners, and after she had saluted us, she said in few words: "That some
						of you have been aware of your wretched condition is hugely pleasing to my
						most mighty Lord, and he is also resolved you shall fare the better for
						it".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 1: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						And having seen me in my habit, she laughed and said, "Goodness! Have you
						also submitted yourself to the yoke? I imagined you would have made
						yourself very smug". With which words she caused my eyes to run over. After
						which she commanded that we should be unbound, and coupled together and
						placed in a station where we might easily see the Scales. For, she said, it
						may yet fare better with them, than with the presumptuous who still stand
						here at liberty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 1: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the scales, which were entirely of gold, were hung up in the
						middle of the hall; there was also a little table covered with red velvet,
						and seven weights placed on it. First of all there was a pretty big one,
						next four little ones, lastly two great ones. And these weights were so
						heavy in proportion to their bulk, that no man can believe or comprehend
						it. But each of the armoured men had, together with a naked sword, a strong
						rope; these she distributed according to the number of weights into seven
						bands, and out of every band chose one for their own weight; and then again
						sprang up into her high throne. Now as soon as she had made her reverence,
						in a very shrill tone she began to speak as follows:
					-

						Whoever goes into an artist's room

						As soon as the Virgin had finished speaking, one of the pages commanded
						each one to place himself according to his order, and one after another to
						step in. Which one of the Emperors made no scruple of, but first of all
						bowed himself a little towards the Virgin, and afterwards in all his
						stately attire went up: whereupon each Captain put in his weight, against
						which (to the wonder of all) he held out. But the last was too heavy for
						him, so that he must go forth; and that he did with so much anguish that
						(as it seemed to me) the Virgin herself had pity on him, and beckoned to
						her people to hold their peace; yet the good Emperor was bound and
						delivered over to the Sixth Band. Next after him again there came another
						Emperor, who stepped haughtily into the Scale, and, having a great thick
						book under his gown, he imagined he would not fail; but he was scarcely
						able to abide the third weight, and was unmercifully flung down, and his
						book in that upheaval fell from him, and all the soldiers began to laugh,
						and he was delivered up bound to the Third Band. Thus it went also with
						some of the other Emperors, who were all shamefully laughed at and put in
						captivity.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						After these there came forth a short little man with a curled brown beard,
						also an Emperor, who after the usual reverence got up, and held out so
						steadfastly, that I thought that had there been more weights ready he would
						have outstood them. To him the Virgin immediately arose, and bowed before
						him, making him put on a gown of red velvet, and finally gave him a branch
						of laurel, of which she had a good store upon her throne, upon the steps of
						which she asked him to sit down. Now how it fared with the rest of the
						Emperors, Kings and Lords after him, would take too long to recount; but I
						cannot leave unmentioned that few of those great personages held out.
						However, various eminent virtues (beyond my hopes) were found in many. One
						could stand out this, the second another, some two, some three, four or
						five, but few could attain to the just perfection; and everyone who failed
						was miserably laughed at by the bands.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						After the Inquisition had also passed over the gentry, the learned, and
						unlearned, and all the rest, and in each condition perhaps one, it may be
						two, but for the most part none, was found perfect, it came at length to
						those honest gentlemen the vagabond cheaters, and rascally Lapidem
						Spitalanficum makers, who were set upon the Scale with such scorn that I
						myself, in spite of all my grief, was ready to burst my belly with
						laughing, nor could the very prisoners themselves refrain. For the most
						part could not abide that severe trial, but were jerked out of the Scale
						with whips and scourges, and led to the other prisoners, but to a suitable
						band. Thus of so great a throng so few remained, that I am ashamed to
						reveal their number. However, there were persons of quality also amongst
						them, who notwithstanding were (like the rest) honoured with velvet robes
						and wreaths of laurel.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						The Inquisition being completely finished, and none but we poor coupled
						hounds standing aside, at length one of the Captains stepped forth, and
						said, "Gracious Madam, if it please your Ladyship, let these poor men who
						acknowledged their misunderstanding be set upon the Scale too, without
						their incurring any danger of penalty, and only for recreation's sake, if
						perhaps anything that is right may be found amongst them".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						In the first place I was in great perplexity, for in my anguish this was my
						only comfort, that I was not to stand in such ignominy, or to be lashed out
						of the Scale. For I did not doubt that many of the prisoners wished that
						they had stayed ten nights with us in the hall. Yet since the Virgin
						consented, so it must be, and we were untied and one after another set up.
						Now although the most part miscarried, they were neither laughed at, nor
						scourged, but peaceably placed on one side. My companion was the fifth, and
						he held out bravely, whereupon all, but especially the Captain who made the
						request for us, applauded him, and the Virgin showed him the usual respect.
						After him again two more were dispatched in an instant. But I was the
						eighth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Now as soon as (with trembling) I stepped up, my companion who already sat
						by in his velvet looked friendlily upon me, and the Virgin herself smiled a
						little. But for as much as I outstood all the weights, the Virgin commanded
						them to draw me up by force, wherefore three men also hung on the other
						side of the beam, and yet nothing could prevail. Whereupon one of the pages
						immediately stood up, and cried out exceedingly loud, "THAT'S HE": upon
						which the other replied, "Then let him gain his liberty"; which the Virgin
						accorded. And, being received with due ceremonies, the choice was given me
						to release one of the captives, whosoever I pleased; whereupon I made no
						long deliberation, but elected the first Emperor whom I had long pitied,
						who was immediately set free, and with all respect seated amongst us.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Now the last being set up, and the weights proving too heavy for him, in
						the meantime the Virgin had spotted my roses, which I had taken out of my
						hat into my hands, and thereupon presently through her page graciously
						requested them of me, and I readily sent them to her.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						And so this first Act was finished about ten in the morning. Whereupon the
						trumpets began to sound again, which nevertheless we could not as yet see.
						Meantime the bands were to step aside with their prisoners, and await the
						judgement. After which a council of the seven captains and us was set, and
						the business was propounded by the Virgin as President, who desired each
						one to give his opinion how the prisoners were to be dealt with. The first
						opinion was that they should all be put to death, yet one more severely
						than another, namely those who had presumptuously intruded themselves
						contrary to the express conditions. Others would have them kept close
						prisoners. Both of which pleased neither the President, nor me. At length
						by one of the Emperors (the same whom I had freed), my companion, and
						myself, the affair was brought to this point: that first of all the
						principal Lords should with a fitting respect be led out of the Castle;
						others might be carried out somewhat more scornfully. These would be
						stripped, and caused to run out naked; the fourth should be hunted out with
						rods, whips or dogs. Those who the day before willingly surrendered
						themselves, might be allowed to depart without any blame. And last of all
						those presumptuous ones, and they who behaved themselves so unseemly at
						dinner the day before, should be punished in body and life according to
						each man's demerit. This opinion pleased the Virgin well, and obtained the
						upper hand. There was moreover another dinner vouchsafed them, which they
						were soon told about. But the execution was deferred till twelve noon.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Herewith the Senate arose, and the Virgin also, together with her
						attendants, returned to her usual quarter. But the uppermost table in the
						room was allotted to us, they requesting us to take it in good part until
						the business was fully dispatched. And then we should be conducted to the
						Lord Bridegroom and the Bride, with which we were at present well content.
						Meanwhile the prisoners were again brought into the hall, and each man
						seated according to his quality. They were likewise told to behave
						themselves somewhat more civilly than they had done the day before, about
						which they yet did not need to have been admonished, for without this, they
						had already put up their pipes.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						And this I can boldly say, not with flattery, but in the love of truth,
						that commonly those persons who were of the highest rank best understood
						how to behave themselves in so unexpected a misfortune. Their treatment was
						but indifferent, yet respectful; neither could they yet see their
						attendants, but to us they were visible, at which I was exceedingly joyful.
						Now although Fortune had exalted us, yet we did not take upon us more than
						the rest, advising them to be of good cheer, the event would not be so bad.
						Now although they would gladly have us reveal their sentence, yet we were
						so deeply obligated that none of us dared open his mouth about it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						Nevertheless we comforted them as well as we could, drinking with them to
						see if the wine might make them any more cheerful. Our table was covered
						with red velvet, beset with drinking cups of pure silver and gold, which
						the rest could not behold without amazement and very great anguish. But
						before we had seated ourselves, in came the two pages, presenting everyone
						on the Bridegroom's behalf with the Golden Fleece with a flying Lion,
						requesting us to wear them at the table, and as became us, to observe the
						reputation and dignity of the Order which his Majesty had now vouchsafed
						us; and we should be ratified with suitable ceremonies. This we received
						with profoundest submission, promising obediently to perform whatsoever his
						Majesty should please. Besides these, the noble page had a schedule in
						which we were set down in order. And for my part I should not otherwise
						wish to conceal my place, if perhaps it might not be interpreted as pride
						in me, which is expressly against the fourth weight.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						Now because our entertainment was exceedingly stately, we demanded of one
						of the pages whether we might not have leave to send some choice bit to our
						friends and acquaintances; he made no difficulty of it, and everyone sent
						plentifully to his acquaintances by the waiters, although they saw none of
						them; and because they did not know where it came from, I myself wished to
						carry something to one of them. But as soon as I had risen, one of the
						waiters was at my elbow, saying he desired me to take friendly warning, for
						if one of the pages had seen it, it would have come to he King's ear, who
						would certainly have taken it amiss of me; but since none had observed it
						but himself, he did not intend to betray me, but that I ought for the time
						to come to have better regard for the dignity of the order. With which
						words the servant really astonished me so much that for a long time
						afterwards I scarcely moved in my seat, yet I returned him thanks for his
						faithful warning, as well as I was able in my haste and fear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Soon after, the drums began to beat again, to which we were already
						accustomed: for we knew well it was the Virgin, so we prepared ourselves to
						receive her; she was now coming in with her usual train, upon her high
						seat, one of the pages bearing before her a very tall goblet of gold, and
						the other a patent in parchment. Having alighted from the seat in a
						marvellous skillful manner, she took the goblet from the page, and
						presented the same on the King's behalf, saying that it was brought from
						his Majesty, and that in honour of him we should cause it to go round. Upon
						the cover of this goblet stood Fortune curiously cast in gold, who had in
						her hand a red flying ensign, because of which I drunk somewhat more sadly,
						having been all too well acquainted with Fortune's waywardness. But the
						Virgin as well as us was adorned with the Golden Fleece and Lion, from
						which I observed that perhaps she was the president of the Order. So we
						asked of her how the Order might be named. She answered that it was not yet
						the right time to reveal this, till the affair with the prisoners was
						dispatched. And therefore their eyes were still veiled ; and what had
						hitherto happened to us, was to them only like an offence and scandal,
						although it was to be accounted as nothing in regard to the honour that
						attended us. Hereupon she began to distinguish the patent which the other
						page held into two different parts, out of which about this much was read
						before the first company:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						"That they should confess that they had too lightly given credit to false
						fictitious books, had assumed too much to themselves, and so come into this
						Castle, although they were never invited into it, and perhaps the most part
						had presented themselves with design to make their market here, and
						afterwards to live in greater pride and lordliness; and thus one had
						seduced another, and plunged him into this disgrace and ignominy, wherefore
						they were deservedly to be soundly punished."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						Which they with great humility readily acknowledged, and gave their hands
						upon it. After which a severe check was given to the rest, much to this
						purpose:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						"That they very well knew, and were in their consciences convinced, that
						they had forged false fictitious books, had fooled others, and cheated
						them, and thereby had diminished regal dignity amongst all. They knew
						likewise what ungodly deceitful figures they had made use of, in so much as
						they spared not even the Divine Trinity, but accustomed themselves to cheat
						people all the country over. It was also now as clear as day with what
						practices they had endeavoured to ensnare the true guests, and introduce
						the ignorant: in such a manner that it was manifest to all the world that
						they wallowed in open whoredom, adultery, gluttony, and other
						uncleannesses: All which was against the express orders of our Kingdom. In
						brief, they knew they had disparaged Kingly Majesty, even amongst the
						common sort, and therefore they should confess themselves to be manifest
						convicted vagabond-cheaters, knaves and rascals, whereby they deserved to
						be kept from the company of civil people, and severely punished."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						The good artists were loath to come to this confession, but inasmuch as not
						only the Virgin herself threatened them, and swore that they would die, but
						the other party also vehemently raged at them, and unanimously cried out
						that they had most wickedly seduced them out of the Light, they at length,
						to prevent a huge misfortune, confessed the same with sadness, and yet
						withal alleged that what had happened here was not to be animadverted upon
						them in the worst sense. For inasmuch as the Lords were absolutely resolved
						to get into the Castle, and had promised great sums of money to that
						effect, each one had used all craft to seize upon something, and so things
						were brought to that state that was now manifest before their eyes. But
						just because it had not succeeded, "They", in their opinion, "had deserved
						no less than the Lords themselves; Who should have had so much
						understanding as to consider that, if anyone could be sure of getting in,
						he should not have clambered over the wall with them, that there should be
						so great peril for the sake of a slight gain?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						Their books also sold so well, that whoever had no other means to maintain
						himself, had to engage in such a deception. They hoped moreover, that if a
						right judgement were made, they should be found in no way to have
						miscarried, for they had behaved themselves towards the Lords, as became
						Servants, upon their earnest entreaty.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						But answer was made to them that his Royal Majesty had determined to punish
						them all, every man, although one more severely than another. For although
						what had been alleged by them was partly true, and therefore the Lords
						should not wholly be indulged, yet they had good reason to prepare
						themselves for death, they who had so presumptuously obtruded themselves,
						and perhaps seduced the more ignorant against their will; as likewise those
						who had violated Royal Majesty with false books, for the same might be
						shown from their very writings and books.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						Hereupon many began to lament, cry, weep, entreat and prostrate themselves
						most piteously, all of which notwithstanding could avail them nothing, and
						I marvelled much how the Virgin could be so resolute, when their misery
						caused our eyes to run over, and moved our compassion (although the most
						part of them had procured us much trouble and vexation). For she presently
						dispatched her page, who brought with him all the Curiassiers who had this
						day been appointed at the Scales, who were each of them commanded to take
						his own to him, and in an orderly procession, so that each Curiassier
						should go with one of the prisoners, to conduct them into her great garden.
						At which time each one so exactly recognised his own man, that I marvelled
						at it. Leave was also likewise given to my companions of yesterday to go
						out into the garden unbound, and to be present at the execution of the
						sentence. Now as soon as every man had come forth, the Virgin mounted up
						into her high throne, requesting us to sit down upon the steps, and to
						appear at the judgement; which we did not refuse, but left everything
						standing upon the table (except the goblet, which the Virgin committed to
						the pages' keeping) and went forth in our robes, upon the throne, which
						moved by itself as gently as if we passed through the air, till in this
						manner we came into the garden, where we all arose together.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 21
				-
					-
						This garden was not extraordinarily curious, but it pleased me that the
						trees were planted in such good order. Besides, there ran in it a most
						costly fountain, adorned with wonderful figures and inscriptions and
						strange characters (which, God willing, I shall mention in a future book).
						In this garden was raised a wooden scaffold, hung about with curiously
						painted figured coverlets. Now there were four galleries made one over
						another; the first was more glorious than any of the rest, and therefore
						covered with a white taffeta curtain, so that at that time we could not
						perceive who was behind it. The second was empty and uncovered. Again the
						last two were covered with red and blue taffeta. Now as soon as we had come
						to the scaffold, the Virgin bowed herself down to the ground, at which we
						were mightily terrified, for we could easily guess that the King and Queen
						must not be far off. Now we also having duly performed our reverence, the
						Virgin led us up by the winding stairs into the second gallery, where she
						placed herself uppermost, and us in our former order. But how the Emperor
						whom I had released behaved himself towards me, both at this time and also
						before at the table, I cannot well relate without slander of wicked
						tongues. For he might well have imagined in what anguish and solicitude he
						should now have been, in case he were at present to attend the judgement
						with such ignominy, and that only through me he had now attained such
						dignity and worthiness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 22
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the Virgin who first of all brought me the invitation, and whom
						until now I had never since seen, came in. First she gave one blast upon
						her trumpet, and then with a very loud voice declared the sentence in this
						manner:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						"The King's Majesty my most gracious Lord could wish with all his heart
						that each and every one here assembled had upon his Majesty's invitation
						presented themselves so qualified as that they might (to his honour) with
						greatest frequency have adorned this his appointed nuptial and joyful
						feast. But since it has otherwise pleased Almighty God, his Majesty has
						nothing about which to murmur, but must be forced, contrary to his own
						inclination, to abide by the ancient and laudable constitutions of this
						Kingdom. But now, so that his Majesty's innate clemency may be celebrated
						all over the world, he has so far absolutely dealt with his Council and
						estates, that the usual sentence shall be considerably lenified.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						So in the first place he is willing to vouchsafe to the Lords and
						Potentates, not only their lives entirely, but also that he will freely and
						frankly dismiss them; friendlily and courteously entreating your Lordships
						not at all to take it in evil part that you cannot be present at his
						Majesty's Feast of Honour; but to remember that there is notwithstanding
						more imposed upon your Lordships by God Almighty (who in the distribution
						of his gifts has an incomprehensible consideration) than you can duly and
						easily sustain. Neither is your reputation hereby prejudiced, although you
						be rejected by this our Order, since we cannot all of us do all things at
						once. But for as much as your Lordships have been seduced by base rascals,
						it shall not, on their part, pass unrevenged. And furthermore his Majesty
						resolves shortly to communicate to your Lordships a catalogue of heretics
						or Index Expurgatorius, that you may henceforth be able to discern between
						the good and the evil with better judgement. And because his Majesty before
						long also intends to rummage his library, and offer up the seductive
						writings to Vulcan, he friendlily, humbly, and courteously entreats every
						one of your Lordships to do the same with your own, whereby it is to be
						hoped that all evil and mischief may for the time to come be remedied. And
						you are withal to be admonished, never henceforth to covet an entrance here
						so inconsiderately, lest the former excuse about seducers be taken from
						you, and you fall into disgrace and contempt with all men. Finally, for as
						much as the estates of the land still have something to demand of your
						Lordships, his Majesty hopes that no man will think much to redeem himself
						with a chain or whatever else he has about him, and so in friendly manner
						to depart from us, and through our safe conduct to take himself home again.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 25
				-
					-
						The others who did not stand up to the first, third and fourth weight, his
						Majesty will not so lightly dismiss. But so that they also may now
						experience his Majesty's gentleness, it is his command to strip them stark
						naked and so send them forth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 26
				-
					-
						Those who in the second and fifth weight were found too light, shall
						besides stripping, be noted with one, two or more brand-marks, according as
						each one was lighter or heavier.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 27
				-
					-
						They who were drawn up by the sixth or seventh, and not by the rest, shall
						be somewhat more graciously dealt with, and so forward. (For to every
						combination there was a certain punishment ordained, which is here too long
						to recount.)
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 28
				-
					-
						They who yesterday separated themselves freely of their own accord, shall
						go out at liberty without any blame.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 29
				-
					-
						Finally, the convicted vagabond-cheaters who could move up none of the
						weights, shall as occasion serves be punished in body and life, with the
						sword, halter, water and rods. And such execution of judgement shall be
						inviolably observed as an example to others."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 30
				-
					-
						Herewith our Virgin broke her wand, and the other who read the sentence
						blew her trumpet, and stepped with most profound reverence towards those
						who stood behind the curtain.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 31
				-
					-
						But here I cannot omit to reveal something to the reader concerning the
						number of our prisoners, of whom those who weighed one, were seven; those
						who weighed two, were twenty one; they who three, thirty five; they who
						four, thirty five; those who five, twenty one; those who six, seven; but he
						that came to the seventh, and yet could not well raise it, he was only one,
						and indeed the same whom I released. Besides these, of them who wholly
						failed there were many; but of those who drew all the weights from the
						ground, but few. And as these each stood before us, so I diligently
						numbered them and noted them down in my table-book; and it is very
						admirable that amongst all those who weighed anything, none was equal to
						another. For although amongst those who weighed three, there were thirty
						five, yet one of them weighed the first, second, and third, another the
						third, fourth, and fifth, a third, the fifth, sixth, and seventh, and so
						on. It is likewise very wonderful that amongst one hundred and twenty six
						who weighed anything, none was equal to another; and I would very willingly
						name them all, with each man's weight, were it not as yet forbidden me. But
						I hope it may hereafter be published with the Interpretation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 32
				-
					-
						Now this judgement being read over, the Lords in the first place were well
						satisfied, because in such severity they did not dare look for a mild
						sentence. So they gave more than was desired of them, and each one redeemed
						himself with chains, jewels, gold, money and other things, as much as they
						had about them, and with reverence took leave. Now although the King's
						servants were forbidden to jeer at any at his going away, yet some unlucky
						birds could not hold their laughter, and certainly it was sufficiently
						ridiculous to see them pack away with such speed, without once looking
						behind them. Some desired that the promised catalogue might at once be
						dispatched after them, and then they would take such order with their books
						as should be pleasing to his Majesty; which was again assured. At the door
						was given to each of them out of a cup a draught of FORGETFULNESS, so that
						he might have no further memory of misfortune.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 33
				-
					-
						After these the Voluntiers departed, who because of their ingenuity were
						allowed to pass, but yet so as never to return again in the same fashion.
						But if to them (as likewise to the others) anything further were revealed,
						then they should be welcome guests.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 34
				-
					-
						Meanwhile others were stripping, in which also an inequality (according to
						each man's demerit) was observed. Some were sent away naked, without other
						hurt. Others were driven out with small bells. Some were scourged forth. In
						brief the punishments were so various, that I am not able to recount them
						all. In the end it came to the last, with whom a somewhat longer time was
						spent, for while some were being hung, some beheaded, some forced to leap
						into the water, and the rest otherwise being dispatched, much time was
						consumed. Verily at this execution my eyes ran over, not indeed in regard
						of the punishment, which they for their impudency well deserved, but in
						contemplation of human blindness, in that we are continually busying
						ourselves in that which ever since the first Fall has been hitherto sealed
						up to us. Thus the garden which so recently was quite full, was soon
						emptied, so that besides the soldiers there was not a man left.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 35
				-
					-
						Now as soon as this was done, and silence had been kept for the space of
						five minutes, there came forth a beautiful snow-white unicorn with a golden
						collar (having on it certain letters) about his neck. In the same place he
						bowed himself down upon both his forefeet, as if hereby he had shown honour
						to the lion, who stood so immoveably upon the fountain, that I had taken
						him to be of stone or brass. The lion immediately took the naked sword
						which he had in his paw, and broke it in two in the middle, and the pieces
						of it, it seemed to me, sunk into the fountain; after which he roared for
						so long, until a white dove brought a branch of olive in her bill, which
						the lion devoured in an instant, and so was quieted. And so the unicorn
						returned to his place with joy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 36
				-
					-
						Hereupon our Virgin led us down again by the winding stairs from the
						scaffold, and so we again made our reverence towards the curtain. We were
						to wash our hands and heads in the fountain, and there to wait a little
						while in our order, till the King was again returned into his hall through
						a certain secret gallery, and then we were also conducted into our former
						lodging with choice music, pomp, state, and pleasant discourse. And this
						was done about four in the afternoon. But so that in the meantime the time
						might not seem too long to us, the Virgin bestowed on each of us a noble
						page, who were not only richly dressed, but also exceedingly learned, so
						that they could so aptly discourse upon all subjects that we had good
						reason to be ashamed of ourselves. These were commanded to lead us up and
						down the Castle, but only into certain places, and if possible, to shorten
						the time according to our desire. Meanwhile the Virgin took leave with this
						consolation, that at supper she would be with us again, and after that
						celebrate the ceremonies of the hanging up of the weights, requesting that
						we would in patience wait till the next day, for on the morrow we must be
						presented to the King.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 37
				-
					-
						She having thus departed from us, each of us did what best pleased him. One
						part viewed the excellent paintings, which they copied out for themselves,
						and considered also what the wonderful characters might signify. Others
						wanted to occupy themselves again with meat and drink.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 38
				-
					-
						I caused my page to conduct me (together with my companion) up and down the
						Castle, which walk I shall never regret as long as I have a day to live.
						For besides many other glorious antiquities, the Royal Sepulchre was also
						showed to me, by which I learned more than is extant in all books. There in
						the same place stands also the glorious phoenix (about which, two years
						ago, I published a particular small discourse). And I am resolved (in case
						this narration shall prove useful) to set forth several particular
						treatises concerning the lion, eagle, griffin, falcon and the like,
						together with their draughts and inscriptions. It grieves me for my other
						companions, that they neglected such precious treasures. And yet I cannot
						but think it was the special will of God that it should be so. I indeed
						reaped the most benefit from my page, for according as each one's genius
						lay, so he led whoever was entrusted to him into the quarters and places
						which were pleasing to him. Now the keys belonging hereunto were committed
						to my page, and therefore this good fortune happened to me before the rest;
						for although he invited others to come in, yet they imagining such tombs to
						be only in the churchyard, thought they should get there well enough,
						whenever anything was to be seen there. Neither shall these monuments (as
						both of us copied and transcribed them) be withheld from my thankful
						scholars.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 39
				-
					-
						The other thing that was shown to us two was the noble library as it was
						all together before the Reformation. Of which (although it makes my heart
						rejoice as often as I call it to mind) I have so much the less to say,
						because the catalogue of it is very shortly to be published. At the entry
						to this room stands a great book, the like of which I never saw, in which
						all the figures, rooms, portals, also all the writings, riddles and the
						like, to be seen in the whole Castle, are delineated. Now although we made
						a promise concerning this also, yet at present I must contain myself, and
						first learn to know the world better. In every book stands its author
						painted; of which (as I understood) many were to be burnt, so that even
						their memory might be blotted out from amongst the righteous.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 40
				-
					-
						Now having taken a full view of this, and having scarcely gone forth,
						another page came running to us, and having whispered something in our
						page's ear, he delivered up the keys to him, who immediately carried them
						up the winding stairs. But our page was very much out of countenance, and
						we having set hard upon him with entreaties, he declared to us that the
						King's Majesty would by no means permit that either of the two, namely the
						library and sepulchres, should be seen by any man, and therefore he
						besought us as we cared for his life, to reveal this to no man, he having
						already utterly denied it. Whereupon both of us stood hovering between joy
						and fear, yet it continued in silence, and no man made further enquiry
						about it. Thus in both places we passed three hours, which I do not at all
						repent.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 41
				-
					-
						Now although it had already struck seven, yet nothing had so far been given
						us to eat; however, our hunger was easy to abate by constant revivings, and
						I could be well content to fast all my life long with such entertainment.
						About this time the curious fountains, mines, and all kinds of art-shops,
						were also shown to us, of which there was none but surpassed all our arts,
						even if they should all be melted into one mass. All their chambers were
						built in a semi-circle, so that they might have before their eyes the
						costly clockwork which was erected upon a fair turret in the centre, and
						regulate themselves according to the course of the planets, which were to
						be seen on it in a glorious manner. And hence I could easily conjecture
						where our artists failed; however it's none of my duty to inform them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 42
				-
					-
						At length I came into a spacious room (shown indeed to the rest a great
						while before) in the middle of which stood a terrestrial globe, whose
						diameter was thirty feet, although nearly half of it, except a little which
						was covered with the steps, was let into the earth. Two men might readily
						turn this globe about with all its furniture, so that no more of it was
						ever to be seen, just so much as was above the horizon. Now although I
						could easily conceive that this was of some special use, yet I could not
						understand what those ringlets of gold (which were upon it in several
						places) served for; at which my page laughed, and advised me to view them
						more closely. In brief, I found there my native country noted in gold also;
						whereupon my companion sought his, and found that so too. Now for as much
						as the same happened in a similar way to the rest who stood by, the page
						told us for certain that it was yesterday declared to the King's Majesty by
						their old Atlas (so is the Astronomer named) that all the gilded points
						exactly answered to their native countries, according as had been shown to
						each of them. And therefore he also, as soon as he perceived that I
						undervalued myself and that nevertheless there stood a point upon my native
						country, moved one of the Captains to entreat for us that we should be set
						upon the scale (without peril) at all adventures; especially seeing one of
						our native countries had a notable good mark. And truly it was not without
						reason that he, the page who had the greatest power of all the rest, was
						bestowed on me. For this I then returned him thanks, and immediately looked
						more diligently upon my native country, and found moreover that besides the
						ringlet, there were also certain delicate streaks upon it, which
						nevertheless I would not be thought to speak about to my own praise and
						glory.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 43
				-
					-
						I saw much more too upon this globe than I am willing to reveal. Let each
						man take into consideration why every city does not produce a philosopher.
						After this he led us right into the globe, which was thus made: on the sea
						(there being a large square beside it) was a tablet, on which stood three
						dedications and the author's name, which a man might gently lift up and by
						a little joined board go into the centre, which was capable of holding four
						persons, being nothing but a round board on which we could sit, and at
						ease, by broad daylight (it was now already dark) contemplate the stars. To
						my thinking they were mere carbuncles which glittered in an agreeable
						order, and moved so gallantly that I had scarcely any mind ever to go out
						again, as the page afterwards told the Virgin, with which she often teased
						me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 44
				-
					-
						For it was already supper-time, and I had so much amused myself in the
						globe, that I was almost the last at the table; so I made no more delay,
						but having put on my gown again (which I had before laid aside) and
						stepping to the table, the waiters treated me with so much reverence and
						honour, that for shame I dared not look up, and so unawares permitted the
						Virgin, who attended me on one side, to stand, which she soon perceiving,
						twitched me by the gown, and so led me to the table. To speak any further
						concerning the music, or the rest of that magnificent entertainment, I hold
						it needless, both because it is not possible to express it well enough, and
						because I have reported it above according to my power. In brief, there was
						nothing there but art and amenity.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 45
				-
					-
						Now after we had related our employment since noon to each other (however,
						not a word was spoken of the library and monuments), being already merry
						with the wine, the Virgin began thus: "My Lords, I have a great contention
						with one of my sisters. In our chamber we have an eagle. Now we cherish him
						with such diligence, that each of us is desirous to be the best beloved,
						and upon that score we have many a squabble. One day we concluded to go
						both together to him, and toward whom he should show himself most friendly,
						hers should he properly be. This we need, and I (as commonly) carried in my
						hand a branch of laurel, but my sister had none. Now as soon as he saw us
						both, he immediately gave my sister another branch which he had in his
						beak, and reached for mine, which I gave him. Now each of us hereupon
						imagined herself to be best beloved of him; which way am I to resolve
						myself? "
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 46
				-
					-
						This modest proposal of the Virgin pleased us all mighty well, and each one
						would gladly have heard the solution, but inasmuch as they all looked to
						me, and wanted me to begin, my mind was so extremely confounded that I knew
						not what else to do with it but propound another in its stead, and
						therefore said: "Gracious Lady, your Ladyship's question would easily be
						resolved if one thing did not perplex me. I had two companions, both of
						which loved me exceedingly; now they being doubtful which of them was most
						dear to me, concluded to run to me, I unawares, and that he whom I should
						then embrace should be the right. This they did, yet one of them could not
						keep pace with the other, so he stayed behind and wept, the other I
						embraced with amazement. Now when they had afterwards discovered the
						business to me, I did not know how to resolve myself, and have since then
						let it rest in this manner, until I may find some good advice herein".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 47
				-
					-
						The Virgin wondered at it, and well observed whereabout I was, whereupon
						she replied, "Well then, let us both be quit"; and then desired the
						solution from the rest.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 48
				-
					-
						But I had already made them wise. So the next began thus. "In the city
						where I live, a Virgin was recently condemned to death, but the Judge,
						being somewhat pitiful towards her, caused it to be proclaimed that if any
						man desired to become the Virgin's Champion, he should have free leave to
						do it. Now she had two lovers; the one presently made himself ready, and
						came into the lists to await his adversary; afterwards the other also
						presented himself, but coming somewhat too late, he resolved nevertheless
						to fight, and willingly suffer himself to be vanquished, so that the
						Virgin's life might be preserved, which also succeeded accordingly".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 49
				-
					-
						Whereupon each challenged her: "Now my Lords, instruct me, to which of them
						of right does she belong?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 50
				-
					-
						The Virgin could hold out no longer, but said, "I thought to have gained
						much information, and have got myself into the net, but yet would gladly
						hear whether there are any more to come."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 51
				-
					-
						"Yes, that there are", answered the third, "a stranger adventure has not
						yet been recounted than that which happened to me. In my youth I loved a
						worthy maid: now so that my love might attain its desired end, I used to
						employ an ancient matron, who easily brought me to her. Now it happened
						that the maid's brethren came in upon us just as we three were together,
						and were in such a rage that they would have taken my life, but upon my
						vehement supplication, they at length forced me to swear to take each of
						them for a year, to be my wedded wife. Now tell me, my Lords, should I take
						the old, or the young one first?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 52
				-
					-
						We all laughed sufficiently at this riddle, and though some of them
						muttered to one another about it, yet none would undertake to unfold it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 53
				-
					-
						Hereupon the fourth began: "In a certain city there dwelt an honourable
						lady, who was beloved of all, but especially by a young nobleman, who was
						too importunate with her. At length she gave him this determination, that
						if he could lead her into a fair green garden of roses in a cold winter,
						then he should obtain what he desired, but if not, he must resolve never to
						see her again. The nobleman traveled to all countries to find such a man as
						might perform this, till at length he found a little old man that promised
						to do it for him, if he would assure him of half his estate; which he
						having consented to the other, was as good as his word. Whereupon he
						invited the aforesaid lady to his garden, where, contrary to her
						expectation, she found all things green, pleasant and warm, and remembering
						her promise, she only requested that she might once more return to her
						lord, to whom with sighs and tears she bewailed her lamentable condition.
						But because he sufficiently perceived her faithfulness, he dispatched her
						back to her lover who had so dearly purchased her, so that she might give
						him satisfaction. This husband's integrity did so mightily affect the
						nobleman, that he thought it a sin to touch so honest a wife; so he sent
						her home again with honour to her lord. Now the little man perceiving such
						faith in both these, would not, however poor he was, be the least in
						honour, but restored to the nobleman all his goods again and went his way.
						Now, my lords, I know not which of these persons may have shown the
						greatest ingenuity?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 54
				-
					-
						Here our tongues were quite cut off. Neither would the Virgin make any
						other reply, but only that another should go on.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 55
				-
					-
						So the fifth, without delay, began: "My Lords, I do not wish to make long
						work of this; who has the greater joy, he that beholds what he loves, or he
						that only thinks on it?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 56
				-
					-
						"He that beholds it," said the Virgin.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 57
				-
					-
						"No," I answered.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 58
				-
					-
						Hereupon a debate arose, so the sixth called out, "My lords, I am to take a
						wife; now I have before me a maid, a married wife, and a widow; ease me of
						this doubt, and I will afterwards help to order the rest."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 59
				-
					-
						"It goes well there," replied the seventh, "where a man has a choice, but
						with me the case is otherwise. In my youth I loved a fair and virtuous
						virgin from the bottom of my heart, and she loved me in similar manner;
						however, because of her friends' denial we could not come together in
						wedlock. Whereupon she was married to another, yet an honest and discreet
						person, who maintained her honourably and with affection, until she came to
						the pains of childbirth, which went so hard for her that all thought she
						was dead, so with much state and great mourning she was interred. Now I
						thought to myself, during her life you could have no part in this woman,
						but now she is dead you may embrace and kiss her sufficiently; so I took my
						servant with me, who dug her up by night. Now having opened the coffin and
						locked her in my arms, feeling about her heart, I found some little motion
						in it still, which increased more and more from my warmth, till at last I
						perceived that she was indeed still alive. So I quietly bore her home, and
						after I had warmed her chilled body with a costly bath of herbs, I
						committed her to my mother until she brought forth a fair son, whom I
						caused to be nursed faithfully, as for his mother. After two days (she
						being then in great amazement) I revealed to her all the preceding affair,
						requesting her for the time to come to live with me as a wife; against
						which she found exception, in case it should be grievous to her husband who
						had maintained her well and honourably. But if it could be otherwise, she
						was obliged in love at present to one as well as the other. Now after two
						months (being then about to make a journey elsewhere) I invited her husband
						as a guest, and amongst other things demanded of him whether, if his
						deceased wife should come home again, he would be content to receive her.
						He affirmed it with tears and lamentations, and I brought him his wife
						together with his son, and gave an account of all the preceding business,
						entreating him to ratify with his consent my intended espousals. After a
						long dispute he could not deny me my right, but had to leave me his wife.
						But there was still a debate about the son."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 60
				-
					-
						Here the Virgin interrupted him, and said, "It makes me wonder how you
						could double the afflicted man's grief."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 61
				-
					-
						"What," he answered, "Was I not concerned about it?" Upon this there arose
						a dispute amongst us, yet most affirmed that he had done right. "No," he
						said, "I freely returned him both his wife and his son. Now tell me, my
						Lords, was my honesty, or this man's joy, the greater?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 62
				-
					-
						These words had so much cheered the Virgin that (as if it had been for the
						sake of these two) she caused a health to be drunk.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 63
				-
					-
						After which the rest of the proposals went on somewhat perplexedly, so that
						I could not retain them all; yet this comes to my mind, that one said that
						a few years before he had seen a physician, who brought a parcel of wood
						against winter, with which he warmed himself all winter long; but as soon
						as the spring returned he sold the very same wood again, and so had use of
						it for nothing.

						"Here there must be skill," said the Virgin, "but the time is now past."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 65
				-
					-
						"Yes," replied my companion, "whoever does not understand how to resolve
						all the riddles may give each man notice of it by a proper messenger, and
						he will not be denied."
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 66
				-
					-
						At this time they began to say grace, and we arose all together from the
						table, satisfied and merry rather than satiated; and it is to be wished
						that all invitations and feastings were kept like this. Having now taken a
						few turns up and down the hall again, the Virgin asked us whether we
						desired to begin the wedding.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 67
				-
					-
						"Yes, noble and virtuous lady," said one. Whereupon she privately
						despatched a page, and yet in the meantime proceeded in discourse with us.
						In brief she had already become so familiar with us, that I ventured to
						request her Name. The Virgin smiled at my curiosity, but yet was not moved,
						but replied:
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 68
				-
					-
						"My Name contains five and fifty, and yet has only eight letters; the third
						is the third part of the fifth, which added to the sixth will produce a
						number whose root shall exceed the third itself by just the first, and it
						is the half of the fourth. Now the fifth and the seventh are equal, the
						last and the fifth are also equal, and make with the second as much as the
						sixth, which contains just four more than the third tripled. Now tell me,
						my lord, what am I called?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 69
				-
					-
						The answer was intricate enough to me, yet I did not leave off, but said,
						"Noble and virtuous lady, may I not have only one letter?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 70
				-
					-
						"Yes", she said, "that may well be done".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 71
				-
					-
						"What then," I replied again, "may the seventh contain?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 72
				-
					-
						"It contains", she said, "as many as there are lords here".
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 73
				-
					-
						With this I was content, and easily found her Name, at which she was very
						pleased, and assured us that much more should yet be revealed to us.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 74
				-
					-
						Meantime certain virgins had made themselves ready, and came in with great
						ceremony. First of all two youths carried lights before them; one of them
						was of jocund countenance, sprightly eyes and gentle proportion. The other
						looked rather angry, and whatever he would have, must be, as I afterwards
						perceived. After them first followed four virgins. One looked shame-facedly
						towards the earth, very humble in behaviour. The second also was a modest,
						bashful virgin. The third, as she entered the room, seemed amazed at
						something, and as I understood, she cannot easily abide where there is too
						much mirth. The fourth brought with her certain small wreaths, thereby to
						manifest her kindness and liberality.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 75
				-
					-
						After these four came two who were somewhat more gloriously appareled; they
						saluted us courteously. One of them had a gown of sky colour spangled with
						golden stars. The other's was green, beautified with red and white stripes.
						On their heads they had thin flying tiffaties, which adorned them most
						becomingly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 76
				-
					-
						At last came one on her own, who had a coronet on her head, but looked up
						rather towards heaven than towards earth. We all thought it was the Bride,
						but were much mistaken, although otherwise in honour, riches and state she
						much surpassed the Bride; and she afterwards ruled the whole Wedding. Now
						on this occasion we all followed our Virgin, and fell down on our knees;
						however, she showed herself to be extremely humble, offering everyone her
						hand, and admonishing us not to be too much surprised at this, for this was
						one of her smallest bounties; but to lift up our eyes to our Creator, and
						learn hereby to acknowledge his omnipotency, and so proceed in our
						enterprised course, employing this grace to the praise of God, and the good
						of man. In sum, her words were quite different from those of our Virgin,
						who was somewhat more worldly. They pierced me through even to my bones and
						marrow.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 77
				-
					-
						"And you," she said further to me, "have received more than others, see
						that you also make a larger return." This to me was a very strange sermon;
						for as soon as we saw the virgins with the music, we imagined we must soon
						begin to dance, but that time was not as yet come. Now the weights, which
						have been mentioned before, stood still in the same place, so the Duchess
						(I knew not yet who she was) commanded each virgin to take up one, but to
						our Virgin she gave her own, which was the last and greatest, and commanded
						us to follow behind. Our majesty was then somewhat abated, for I observed
						well that our Virgin was too good for us, and we were not so highly reputed
						as we ourselves were almost in part willing to fantasise. So we went behind
						in our order, and were brought into the first chamber, where our Virgin in
						the first place hung up the Duchess' weight, during which an excellent
						spiritual hymn was sung. There was nothing costly in this room save only
						curious little prayer books which should never be missing. In the middle
						was erected a pulpit, very convenient for prayer, in which the Duchess
						kneeled down, and about her we all had to kneel and pray after the Virgin,
						who read out of a book, that this Wedding might tend to the honour of God,
						and our own benefit. Afterwards we came into the second chamber, where the
						first Virgin hung up her weight too, and so forward until all the
						ceremonies were finished. Hereupon the Duchess again presented her hand to
						everyone, and departed hence with her virgin.
					-
				-
					Chapter 3: Section 3: Paragraph 78

					-
						Our president stayed yet a while with us. But because it had already been
						night for two hours, she would no longer detain us. I thought she was glad
						of our company, yet she bade us good night, and wished us quiet rest, and
						so departed friendlily, although unwillingly, from us. Our pages were well
						instructed in their business, and therefore showed every man his chamber,
						and stayed with us too in another bed, so that in case we wanted anything
						we might make use of them. My chamber (of the rest I am not able to speak)
						was royally furnished with rare tapestries, and hung about with paintings.
						But above all things I delighted in my page, who was so excellently spoken,
						and experienced in the arts, that he spent yet another hour with me, and it
						was half past three when I first fell asleep. And this was the first night
						that I slept in quiet, and yet a scurvy dream would not let me rest; for
						all the night I was troubled with a door which I could not get open, but at
						last I did it. With these fantasies I passed the time, till at length
						towards day I awakened.

						I was still lying in my bed, and leisurely surveying all the noble images
						and figures up and down about my chamber, when suddenly I heard the music
						of coronets, as if they were already in procession. My page jumped out of
						the bed as if he had been at his wit's end, and looked more like one dead
						than living. In what state I was then is easily imaginable, for he said,
						"The rest are already presented to the King." I did not know what else to
						do but weep outright and curse my own slothfulness; yet I dressed myself,
						but my page was ready long before me, and ran out of the chamber to see how
						affairs might yet stand. But he soon returned, and brought with him this
						joyful news, that indeed the time was not yet, but I had only overslept my
						breakfast, they being unwilling to awaken me because of my age.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 1: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						But now it was time for me to go with him to the fountain where most of
						them were assembled. With this consolation my spirit returned again, so I
						was soon ready with my habit, and went after the page to the fountain in
						the aforementioned garden, where I found that the lion, instead of his
						sword, had a pretty large tablet by him. Now having looked well at it, I
						found that it was taken out of the ancient monuments, and placed here for
						some special honour. The inscription was somewhat worn out with age, and
						therefore I have a mind to set it down here, as it is, and give everyone
						leave to consider it.

						Now after we had first washed ourselves out of the fountain, and every man
						had taken a draught out of an entirely golden cup, we were once again to
						follow the Virgin into the hall, and there put on new apparel, which was
						all of cloth of gold gloriously set out with flowers. There was also given
						to everyone another Golden Fleece, which was set about with precious
						stones, and various workmanship according to the utmost skill of each
						artificer. On it hung a weighty medal of gold, on which were figured the
						sun and moon in opposition; but on the other side stood this saying, "The
						light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the
						sun shall be seven times lighter than at present." But our former jewels
						were laid in a little casket, and committed to one of the waiters.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						After this the Virgin led us out in our order, where the musicians waited
						ready at the door, all appareled in red velvet with white guards. After
						which a door (which I never saw open before) to the Royal winding stairs
						was unlocked. There the Virgin led us, together with the music, up three
						hundred and sixty five stairs; there we saw nothing that was not of
						extremely costly workmanship, full of artifice; and the further we went,
						the more glorious still was the furniture, until at length at the top we
						came under a painted arch, where the sixty virgins attended us, all richly
						appareled. Now as soon as they had bowed to us, and we, as well as we
						could, had returned our reverence, our musicians were sent away, and must
						go down the stairs again, the door being shut after them. After this a
						little bell was tolled; then in came in a beautiful Virgin who brought
						everyone a wreath of laurel. But our virgins had branches given them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Meanwhile a curtain was drawn up, where I saw the King and Queen as they
						sat there in their majesty, and had not the Duchess yesterday so faithfully
						warned me, I should have forgotten myself, and have equaled this
						unspeakable glory to Heaven. For apart from the fact that the room
						glistened with gold and precious stones, the Queen's robes were moreover
						made so that I was not able to behold them. And whereas before I esteemed
						anything to be handsome, here all things so much surpassed the rest, as the
						stars in heaven are elevated.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						In the meantime the Virgin came in, and so each of the virgins taking one
						of us by the hand, with most profound reverence presented us to the King,
						whereupon the Virgin began to speak thus: "That to honour your Royal
						Majesties (most gracious King and Queen) these lords here present have
						ventured here in peril of body and life, your Majesties have reason to
						rejoice, especially since the greatest part are qualified for the enlarging
						of your Majesties' Estates and Empire, as you will find by a most gracious
						and particular examination of each of them. Herewith I desired to have them
						presented in humility to your Majesties, with most humble suit to discharge
						myself of this commission of mine, and most graciously to take sufficient
						information from each of them, concerning both my actions and omissions."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Hereupon she laid down her branch upon the ground. Now it would have been
						very fitting for one of us to have put in and said something on this
						occasion, but seeing we were all tongue-tied, at length the old Atlas
						stepped forward and spoke on the King's behalf:- "Their Royal Majesties do
						most graciously rejoice at your arrival, and wish that their Royal Grace be
						assured to all, and every man. And with your administration, gentle Virgin,
						they are most graciously satisfied, and accordingly a Royal Reward shall
						therefore be provided for you. Yet it is still their intention that you
						shall also continue to be with them this day, inasmuch as they have no
						reason to mistrust you."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						Hereupon the Virgin humbly took up the branch again. And so we for the
						first time were to step aside with our Virgin. This room was square on the
						front, five times broader than it was long; but towards the West it had a
						great arch like a porch, wherein in a circle stood three glorious royal
						thrones, yet the middlemost was somewhat higher than the rest. Now in each
						throne sat two persons. In the first sat a very ancient King with a grey
						beard, yet his consort was extraordinarily fair and young. In the third
						throne sat a black King of middle age, and by him a dainty old matron, not
						crowned, but covered with a veil. But in the middle sat the two young
						persons, and though they had likewise wreaths of laurel upon their heads,
						yet over them hung a large and costly crown. Now although they were not at
						this time so fair as I had before imagined to myself, yet so it was to be.
						Behind them on a round form sat for the most part ancient men, yet none of
						them had any sword or other weapon about him, at which I wondered. Neither
						saw I any other body-guard, but certain Virgins who were with us the day
						before, who sat on the sides of the arch.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Here I cannot pass over in silence how the little Cupid flew to and fro
						there, but for the most part he hovered over and played the wanton about
						the great crown; sometimes he seated himself between the two lovers,
						somewhat smiling upon them with his bow. Indeed, sometimes he made as if he
						would shoot one of us. In brief, this knave was so full of his waggery,
						that we would not even spare the little birds which flew in multitudes up
						and down the room, but tormented them all he could. The virgins also had
						their pastimes with him, but whenever they could catch him, it was not so
						easy a matter for him to get from them again. Thus this little knave made
						all the sport and mirth.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Before the Queen stood a small but inexpressibly curious altar, on which
						lay a book covered with black velvet, a little overlaid with gold. By this
						stood a small taper in an ivory candlestick. Now although it was very
						small, yet it burnt continually, and was such that had not Cupid, in sport,
						now and then puffed upon it, we could not have conceived it to be fire. By
						this stood a sphere or celestial globe, which turned clearly about by
						itself. Next to this, a small striking-watch, and by that was a little
						crystal pipe or syphon-fountain, out of which perpetually ran a clear
						blood-red liquor. And last of all there was a skull, or death's head; in
						this was a white serpent, who was of such a length that though she wound
						about the rest of it in a circle, her tail still remained in one of the
						eyeholes until her head again entered the other; so she never stirred from
						her skull, unless it happened that Cupid twitched a little at her, for then
						she slipped in so suddenly that we all could not choose but marvel at it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						Together with this altar, there were up and down the room wonderful images,
						which moved themselves as if they had been alive, and had so strange a
						contrivance that it would be impossible for me to relate it all. Likewise,
						as we were passing out, there began such a marvellous kind of vocal music,
						that I could not tell for sure whether it was performed by the virgins who
						still stayed behind, or by the images themselves. Now we being satisfied
						for the time being, went away with our virgins, who (the musicians being
						already present) led us down the winding stairs again, and the door was
						diligently locked and bolted.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						As soon as we had come again into the hall, one of the virgins began: "I
						wonder, Sister, that you dare hazard yourself amongst so many people."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						"My Sister," replied our president, "I am afraid of none so much as of this
						man," pointing at me.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						This speech went to my heart, for I well understood that she mocked at my
						age, and indeed I was the oldest of them all. Yet she comforted me again
						with the promise that if I behaved myself well towards her, she would
						easily rid me of this burden.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						Meantime a light meal was again brought in, and everyone's Virgin seated by
						him; they knew well how to shorten the time with handsome discourses, but
						what their discourses and sports were I dare not blab out of school. But
						most of the questions were about the arts, whereby I could easily gather
						that both young and old were conversant in knowledge. But still it ran in
						my thoughts how I might become young again, whereupon I was somewhat
						sadder.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						The Virgin perceived this, and therefore began, "I bet anything, if I lie
						with him tonight, he shall be pleasanter in the morning."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						Hereupon they all began to laugh, and although I blushed all over, yet I
						had to laugh too at my own ill-luck.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						Now there was one there who had a mind to return my disgrace upon the
						Virgin again, so he said, "I hope not only we, but the virgins themselves
						too, will bear witness on behalf of our brother, that our lady president
						has promised to be his bedfellow tonight."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						"I should be well content with it," replied the Virgin, "if I had no reason
						to be afraid of my sisters here; there would be no hold with them should I
						choose the best and handsomest for myself, against their will."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						"My Sister," began another, "we find by this that your high office doesn't
						make you proud; so if with your permission we might divide by lot the lords
						here present among us for bedfellows, you should with our good will have
						such a prerogative."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 21
				-
					-
						We let this pass for a jest, and again began to discourse together. But our
						Virgin could not leave tormenting us, and therefore began again. "My lords,
						what about if we should let fortune decide which of us must lie together
						tonight?"
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 22
				-
					-
						"Well," I said, "if it may not be otherwise, we cannot refuse such an
						offer."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						Now because it was concluded to make this trial after the meal, we resolved
						to sit no longer at table, so we arose, and each one walked up and down
						with his Virgin.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						"No," said the Virgin, "it shall not be so yet, but let us see how fortune
						will couple us," upon which we were separated.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 25
				-
					-
						But now first arose a dispute how the business should be carried out; but
						this was only a premeditated device, for the Virgin instantly made the
						proposal that we should mix ourselves together in a ring, and that she
						beginning to count the seventh from herself, was to be content with the
						following seventh, whether it were a virgin, or a man. For our parts we
						were not aware of any craft, and therefore permitted it to be so; but when
						we thought we had mingled ourselves very well, the virgins nevertheless
						were so clever that each one knew her station beforehand. The Virgin began
						to reckon; the seventh from her was another virgin, the third seventh a
						virgin likewise, and this happened so long till (to our amazement) all the
						virgins came forth, and none of us was hit. Thus we poor pitiful wretches
						remained standing alone, and were moreover forced to suffer ourselves to be
						jeered at, and to confess we were very handsomely tricked. In short,
						whoever had seen us in our order, might sooner have expected the sky to
						fall, than that it should never have come to our turn. With this our sport
						was at an end, and we had to satisfy ourselves with the Virgin's waggery.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 26
				-
					-
						In the interim, the little wanton Cupid came in to us too. But we could not
						sport ourselves with him enough, because he presented himself on behalf of
						their Royal Majesties, and delivered us a health (from them) out of a
						golden cup, and had to call our virgins to the King, declaring also that he
						could at this time tarry no longer with them. So with a due return of our
						most humble thanks we let him fly off again.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 27
				-
					-
						Now because (in the interim) the mirth had begun to fall to my consort's
						feet - and the virgins were not sorry to see it - they quickly started up a
						civil dance, which I beheld with pleasure rather than taking part; for my
						mercurialists were so ready with their postures, as if they had long been
						of the trade. After a few dances our president came in again, and told us
						how the artists and students had offered themselves to their Royal
						Majesties, for their honour and pleasure, to act a merry comedy before
						their departure; and if we thought it good to be present at this, and to
						wait upon their Royal Majesties to the House of the Sun, it would be
						acceptable to them, and they would most graciously acknowledge it. Hereupon
						in the first place we returned our most humble thanks for the honour
						vouchsafed us; not only this, but moreover we most submissively tendered
						our humble service.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 28
				-
					-
						This the Virgin related again, and presently brought word to attend their
						Royal Majesties (in our order) in the gallery, where we were soon led; and
						we did not stay long there, for the Royal Procession was just ready, yet
						without any music at all. The unknown Duchess who was with us yesterday
						went in front, wearing a small and costly coronet, appareled in white
						satin. She carried nothing but a small crucifix which was made of a pearl,
						and this very day wrought between the young King and his Bride. After her
						went the six aforementioned virgins in two ranks, who carried the King's
						jewels belonging to the little altar. Next to these came the three Kings.
						The Bridegroom was in the midst of them in a plain dress, but in black
						satin, after the Italian fashion. He had on a small round black hat, with a
						little pointed black feather, which he courteously took off to us, so to
						signify his favour towards us. We bowed ourselves to him, as also to the
						first, as we had been instructed before. After the Kings came the three
						Queens, two of whom were richly dressed, but she in the middle was likewise
						all in black, and Cupid held up her train. After this, intimation was given
						to us to follow, and after us the Virgins, till at last old Atlas brought
						up the rear.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 29
				-
					-
						In such procession, through many stately walks, we at length came to the
						House of the Sun, there next to the King and Queen, upon a richly furnished
						scaffold, to behold the previously ordained comedy. We indeed, though
						separated, stood on the right hand of the Kings, but the virgins stood on
						the left, except those to whom the Royal Ensigns were committed. To them
						was allotted their own place at the top of all. But the rest of the
						attendants had to stand below between the columns, and to be content with
						that.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 30
				-
					-
						Now because there are many remarkable passages in this comedy, I will not
						omit to go over it briefly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 31
				-
					-
						First of all a very ancient King came on, with some servants; before his
						throne was brought a little chest, with mention being made that it was
						found upon the water. Now it being opened, there appeared in it a lovely
						baby, together with some jewels, and a small letter of parchment sealed and
						superscribed to the King, which the King therefore opened; and having read
						it, wept, and then declared to his servants how injuriously the King of the
						Moors had deprived his aunt of her country, and had extinguished all the
						royal seed even to his infant, with the daughter of which country he had
						now the intention of matching his son. Hereupon he swore to maintain
						perpetual enmity with the Moor and his allies, and to revenge this upon
						them; and with this he commanded that the child should be tenderly nursed,
						and to make preparation against the Moor. Now this provision, and the
						disciplining of the young lady (who after she had grown up a little was
						committed to an ancient tutor) took up all the first act, with many very
						fine and laudable sports besides.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 32
				-
					-
						In the interlude a lion and griffin were set at one another to fight, and
						the lion got the victory, which was also a pretty sight.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 33
				-
					-
						In the second act, the Moor, a very black treacherous fellow, came on too.
						He, having with vexation understood that his murder had been discovered,
						and that a little lady was craftily stolen from him too, began thereupon to
						consult how by stratagem he might be able to encounter so powerful an
						adversary; on which he was eventually advised by certain fugitives who fled
						to him because of a famine. So the young lady, contrary to everyone's
						expectations, fell again into his hands; he would have been likely to have
						caused her to be slain if he had not been wonderfully deceived by his own
						servants. Thus this act was concluded too, with a marvellous triumph of the
						Moor.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 34
				-
					-
						In the third act a great army of the King's party was raised against the
						Moor, and put under the conduct of an ancient valiant knight, who fell into
						the Moor's country, till at length he forcibly rescued the young lady from
						the tower, and appareled her anew. After this in a trice they erected a
						glorious scaffold, and placed their young lady upon it. Presently twelve
						royal ambassadors came, amongst whom the aforementioned knight made a
						speech, alleging that the King his most gracious lord had not only
						delivered her from death earlier, and even caused her to be royally brought
						up until now (though she had not behaved herself altogether as became her).
						But moreover his Royal Majesty had, before others, elected her to be a
						spouse for the young lord his son, and most graciously desired that the
						said espousals might actually be executed, if they would be sworn to his
						Majesty upon the following articles. Hereupon out of a patent he caused
						certain glorious conditions to be read, which if it were not too long,
						would be well worthy of being recounted here. In brief, the young lady took
						an oath inviolably to observe the same, returning thanks too in a most
						seemly way for such a high grace. Whereupon they began to sing to the
						praise of God, of the King, and the young lady, and so for the time being
						departed.

						For sport, in the meantime, the four beasts of Daniel, as he saw them in
						the vision and as he described them at length, were brought in, all of
						which had its certain signification.

				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 36
				-
					-
						In the fourth act the young lady was again restored to her lost kingdom,
						and crowned, and for a while, in this array, conducted about the place with
						extraordinary joy. After this many and various ambassadors presented
						themselves, not only to wish her prosperity, but also to behold her glory.
						Yet it was not for long that she preserved her integrity, but soon began
						again to look wantonly about her, and to wink at the ambassadors and lords;
						in this she truly acted her part to the life.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 37
				-
					-
						These manners of hers were soon known to the Moor, who would by no means
						neglect such an opportunity, and because her steward did not pay sufficient
						attention to her, she was easily blinded with great promises, so that she
						did not keep good confidence with her King, but privately submitted herself
						entirely to the disposal of the Moor. Hereupon the Moor made haste, and
						having (by her consent) got her into his hands, he gave her good words
						until all her kingdom had subjected itself to him. After which, in the
						third scene of this act, he caused her to be led forth, and first to be
						stripped stark naked, and then to be bound to a post upon a scurvy wooden
						scaffold, and well scourged, and at last sentenced to death. This was so
						woeful a spectacle, that it made the eyes of many run over. Hereupon like
						this, naked as she was, she was cast into prison, there to await her death,
						which was to be procured by poison, which actually did not kill her, but
						made her leprous all over. Thus this act was for the most part lamentable.

					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 38

					-
						Between acts, they brought forth Nebuchadnezzar's image, which was adorned
						with all manner of arms, on the head, breast, belly, legs and feet, and the
						like, of which more shall be said in the future explanation.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 39
				-
					-
						In the fifth act the young King was told of all that had passed between the
						Moor and his future spouse; he first interceded with his father for her,
						entreating that she might not be left in that condition; which his father
						having agreed to, ambassadors were despatched to comfort her in her
						sickness and captivity, but yet also to make her see her inconsiderateness.
						But she still would not receive them, but consented to be the Moor's
						concubine, which was also done, and the young King was acquainted with it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 40
				-
					-
						After this came a band of fools, each of which brought with him a cudgel;
						within a trice they made a great globe of the world, and soon undid it
						again. It was a fine sportive fantasy.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 41
				-
					-
						In the sixth act the young King resolved to do battle with the Moor, which
						was also done. And although the Moor was discomforted, yet all held the
						young King too to be dead. At length he came to himself again, released his
						spouse, and committed her to his steward and chaplain. The first of these
						tormented her greatly; then the tables were turned, and the priest was so
						insolently wicked that he had to be above all, until this was reported to
						the young King; who hastily despatched one who broke the neck of the
						priest's mightiness, and adorned the bride in some measure for the
						nuptials.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 42
				-
					-
						After the act a vast artificial elephant was brought forth. He carried a
						great tower with musicians, which was also well pleasing to all.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 43
				-
					-
						In the last act the bridegroom appeared with such pomp as cannot be
						believed, and I was amazed how it was brought to pass. The bride met him in
						similar solemnity, whereupon all the people cried out LONG LIVE THE
						BRIDEGROOM! LONG LIVE THE BRIDE! - so that by this comedy they also
						congratulated our King and Queen in the most stately manner, which (as I
						well observed) pleased them most extraordinarily well.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 2: Paragraph 44

						At length they walked about the stage in this procession, till at last they
						began to sing altogether as follows:

						After this thanks were returned, and the comedy was finished with joy, and
						the particular enjoyment of the Royal Persons, so (the evening also drawing
						near already) they departed together in their aforementioned order.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						But we were to attend the Royal Persons up the winding stairs into the
						aforementioned hall, where the tables were already richly furnished, and
						this was the first time that we were invited to the King's table. The
						little altar was placed in the midst of the hall, and the six royal ensigns
						previously mentioned were laid upon it. At this time the young King behaved
						himself very graciously towards us, but yet he could not be heartily merry;
						although he now and then discoursed a little with us, yet he often sighed,
						at which the little Cupid only mocked, and played his waggish tricks. The
						old King and Queen were very serious; only the wife of one of the ancient
						Kings was gay enough, the reason for which I did not yet understand.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						During this time, the Royal Persons took up the first table, at the second
						only we sat. At the third, some of the principal virgins placed themselves.
						The rest of the virgins, and men, all had to wait. This was performed with
						such state and solemn stillness that I am afraid to say very much about it.
						But I cannot leave untouched upon here, how all the Royal Persons, before
						the meal, attired themselves in snow-white glittering garments, and so sat
						down at the table. Over the table hung the great golden crown, the precious
						stones of which would have sufficiently illuminated the hall without any
						other light. However, all the lights were kindled at the small taper upon
						the altar; what the reason was I did not know for sure. But I took very
						good notice of this, that the young King frequently sent meat to the white
						serpent upon the little altar, which caused me to muse.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						Almost all the prattle at this banquet was made by little Cupid, who could
						not leave us (and me, indeed, especially) untormented. He was perpetually
						producing some strange matter. However, there was no considerable mirth,
						all went silently on; from which I, myself, could imagine some great
						imminent peril. For there was no music at all heard; but if we were
						demanded anything, we had to give short round answers, and so let it rest.
						In short, all things had so strange a face, that the sweat began to trickle
						down all over my body; and I am apt to believe that the most stout-hearted
						man alive would then have lost his courage.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Supper being now almost ended, the young King commanded the book to be
						reached him from the little altar. This he opened, and caused it once again
						to be propounded to us by an old man, whether we resolved to abide by him
						in prosperity and adversity; which we having consented to with trembling,
						he further had us asked, whether we would give him our hands on it, which,
						when we could find no evasion, had to be so. Hereupon one after another
						arose, and with his own hand wrote himself down in this book.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						When this also had been performed, the little crystal fountain, together
						with a very small crystal glass, was brought near, out of which all the
						Royal Persons drank one after another. Afterwards it was held out to us
						too, and so to all persons; and this was called the Draught of Silence.
						Hereupon all the Royal Persons presented us their hands, declaring that if
						we did not now stick to them, we should nevermore from now on see them;
						which truly made our eyes run over. But our president engaged herself and
						promised a great deal on our behalf, which gave them satisfaction.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Meantime a little bell was tolled, at which all the Royal Persons became so
						incredibly bleak, that we were ready to despair utterly. They quickly took
						off their white garments again, and put on entirely black ones. The whole
						hall likewise was hung about with black velvet, the floor was covered with
						black velvet, with which also the ceiling above was overspread (all this
						being prepared beforehand). After that the tables were also removed, and
						all seated themselves round about upon the form, and we also put on black
						habits. In came our president again, who had before gone out, and she
						brought with her six black taffeta scarves, with which she bound the six
						Royal Persons' eyes. Now when they could no longer see, six covered coffins
						were immediately brought in by the servants, and set down in the hall; also
						a low black seat was placed in the middle. Finally, there came in a very
						coal-black, tall man, who bore in his hand a sharp axe. Now after the old
						King had first been brought to the seat, his head was instantly whipped
						off, and wrapped in a black cloth; but the blood was received into a great
						golden goblet, and placed with him in this coffin that stood by; which,
						being covered, was set aside. Thus it went with the rest also, so that I
						thought it would at length have come to me too, but it did not. For as soon
						as the six Royal Persons were beheaded, the black man went out again;
						another followed after him, and beheaded him too just before the door, and
						brought back his head together with the axe, which were laid in a little
						chest. This indeed seemed to me a bloody Wedding, but because I could not
						tell what was yet to happen, for the time being I had to suspend my
						understanding until I had further resolved things. For the Virgin too,
						seeing that some of us were faint-hearted and wept, bid us be content.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						"For", she said to us, "The life of these now stands in your hands, and if
						you follow me, this death shall make many alive."
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						With this she intimated that we should go to sleep, and trouble ourselves
						no further on their part, for they should be sure to have their due right.
						And so she bade us all goodnight, saying that she must watch the dead
						bodies this night. We did this, and were each of us conducted by our pages
						into our lodgings. My page talked with me of sundry and various matters
						(which I still remember very well) and gave me cause enough to admire his
						understanding. But his intention was to lull me to sleep, which at last I
						well observed; so I made as though I was fast asleep, but no sleep came
						into my eyes, and I could not put the beheaded out of my mind.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Now my lodging was directly over against the great lake, so that I could
						easily look upon it, the windows being near to the bed. About midnight, as
						soon as it had struck twelve, suddenly I saw a great fire on the lake, so
						out of fear I quickly opened the window to see what would become of it.
						Then from afar I saw seven ships making forward, which were all full of
						lights. Above each of them on the top hovered a flame that passed to and
						fro, and sometimes descended right down, so that I could easily judge that
						it must be the spirits of the beheaded. Now these ships gently approached
						land, and each of them had no more than one mariner. As soon as they had
						come to shore, I saw our Virgin with a torch going towards the ship, after
						whom the six covered coffins were carried, together with the little chest,
						and each of them was secretly laid in a ship.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						So I awakened my page too, who greatly thanked me, for, having run up and
						down a lot all day, he might have slept through this altogether, though he
						knew quite well about it. Now as soon as the coffins were laid in the
						ships, all the lights were extinguished, and the six flames passed back
						together over the lake, so that there was no more than one light in each
						ship for a watch. There were also some hundreds of watchmen who had
						encamped themselves on the shore, and sent the Virgin back again into the
						castle; she carefully bolted everything up again, so that I could judge
						that there was nothing more to be done this night, but that we must await
						the day.
					-
				-
					Chapter 4: Section 4: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						So we again took ourselves to rest. And I only of all my company had a
						chamber towards the lake, and saw this, so that now I was also extremely
						weary, and so fell asleep in my manifold speculations.

					Chapter 5: Section 1: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						The night was over, and the dear wished-for day broken, when hastily I got
						out of bed, more desirous to learn what might yet ensue, than that I had
						slept enough. Now after I had put on my clothes, and according to my custom
						had gone down the stairs, it was still too early, and I found nobody else
						in the hall; so I entreated my page to lead me about a little in the
						castle, and show me something rare. He was now (as always) willing, and led
						me down certain steps under ground, to a great iron door, on which the
						following words in great copper letters were fixed:
					-
			-
				Chapter 5: Section 2
			-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 2: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						(Here lies buried Venus, that beauty which has undone many a great man both
						in fortune, honour, blessing and prosperity.)
					-
			-
				Chapter 5: Section 3
			-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						This I thus copied, and set down in my table-book. Now after this door was
						opened, the page led me by the hand through a very dark passage, till we
						came again to a very little door, that was only now put to; for (as my page
						informed me) it was first opened yesterday when the coffins were taken out,
						and had not since been shut. Now as soon as we stepped in, I saw the most
						precious thing that Nature ever created, for this vault had no light other
						than that from certain huge great carbuncles, and this (as I was informed)
						was the King's Treasury. But the main and most glorious thing that I saw
						here was a sepulchre (which stood in the middle) so rich that I wondered
						that it was not better guarded. To which the page answered me, that I had
						good reason to be thankful to my planet, by whose influence it was that I
						had now seen certain pieces which no other human eye (except the King's
						family) had ever had a view of.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						This sepulchre was triangular, and had in the middle of it a vessel of
						polished copper; the rest was of pure gold and precious stones. In the
						vessel stood an angel, who held in his arms an unknown tree, which
						continually dropped fruit into the vessel; and as often as the fruit fell
						into the vessel, it turned into water, and ran out from there into three
						small golden vessels standing by. This little altar was supported by these
						three animals, an eagle, an ox and a lion, which stood on an exceedingly
						costly base.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						I asked my page what this might signify.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						"Here," he said, "lies buried Lady Venus, that beauty which has undone many
						a great man, both in fortune, honour, blessing and prosperity." After which
						he showed me a copper door on the pavement.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						"Here," he said, "if you please, we may go further down."
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						"I still follow you," I replied.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						So I went down the steps, where it was exceedingly dark, but the page
						immediately opened a little chest, in which stood a small ever-burning
						taper, at which he kindled one of the torches which lay by. I was greatly
						terrified, and seriously asked how he dared do this?
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						He said by way of answer "As long as the Royal Persons are still at rest,
						we have nothing to fear."
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 3: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Then I saw a rich bed ready made, hung about with curious curtains, one of
						which he drew aside, where I saw the Lady Venus stark naked (for he heaved
						up the coverlets too) lying there in such beauty, and in such a surprising
						fashion, that I was almost beside myself; neither do I yet know whether it
						was a piece thus carved, or a human corpse that lay dead there. For she was
						altogether immovable, and yet I dared not touch her. So she was again
						covered, and the curtain drawn before her, yet she was still (as it were)
						in my eye. But I soon saw behind the bed a tablet on which it was written
						as follows:
					-
			-
				Chapter 5: Section 4
			-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 4: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						(When the fruit of my tree shall be quite melted down then I shall awake
						and be the mother of a King.)
					-
			-
				Chapter 5: Section 5
			-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						I asked my page about this writing, but he laughed, with the promise that I
						should know it too. So, he putting out the torch, we ascended again. Then I
						had a better look at all the little doors, and first found that on every
						corner there burned a small taper of pyrites, of which I had before taken
						no notice, for the fire was so clear that it looked much more like a stone
						than a taper. From this heat the tree was forced continually to melt, yet
						it still produced new fruit. Now behold (said the page) what I heard
						revealed to the King by Atlas. When the tree (he said) shall be quite
						melted down, then shall Lady Venus awake, and be the mother of a King.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Whilst he was thus speaking, in flew the little Cupid, who at first was
						somewhat abashed at our presence, but seeing us both look more like the
						dead than the living, he could not in the end refrain from laughing,
						demanding what spirit had brought us there. I with trembling answered him,
						that I had lost my way in the castle, and had come here by chance, and that
						the page likewise had been looking up and down for me, and at last came
						upon me here, and I hoped he would not take it amiss.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						"Well then, that's well enough yet, my old busy grandsire," said Cupid,
						"but you might easily have served me a scurvy trick, had you been aware of
						this door. Now I must look better to it," and so he put a strong lock on
						the copper door where we had before descended.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						I thanked God that he had not come upon us sooner. My page too was happier,
						because I had helped him so well at this pinch.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						"Yet," said Cupid, "I cannot let it pass unrevenged that you were so near
						stumbling upon my dear mother."
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						With that he put the point of his dart into one of the little tapers, and
						heating it a little, pricked me with it on the hand, which at that time I
						paid little attention to, but was glad that it had gone so well for us, and
						that we came off without further danger.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Meantime my companions had got out of bed too, and had returned into the
						hall again. To them I also joined myself, making as if I had just risen.
						After Cupid had carefully made all fast again, he came to us too, and would
						have me show him my hand, where he still found a little drop of blood; at
						which he heartily laughed, and bade the rest have a care of me, as I would
						shortly end my days. We all wondered how Cupid could be so merry, and have
						no sense at all of yesterday's sad occurrences. But he was in no way
						troubled.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						Now our president had in the meantime made herself ready for the journey,
						coming in all in black velvet, yet she still carried her branch of laurel.
						Her virgins too had their branches. Now all things being ready, the Virgin
						asked us first to drink something, and then presently to prepare for the
						procession, so we did not tarry long but followed her out of the hall into
						the court. In the court stood six coffins, and my companions thought
						nothing other than that the six Royal Persons lay in them, but I well
						observed the device. Yet I did not know what was to be done with these
						others. By each coffin were eight muffled men. Now as soon as the music
						began (it was so mournful and dolesome a tune, that I was astonished at it)
						they took up the coffins, and we (as we were ordered) had to go after them
						into the aforementioned garden, in the middle of which was erected a wooden
						edifice, having round about the roof a glorious crown, and standing upon
						seven columns. Within it were formed six sepulchres, and by each of them
						was a stone; but in the middle was a round hollow rising stone. In these
						graves the coffins were quietly and with many ceremonies laid. The stones
						were shoveled over them, and they shut fast. But the little chest was to
						lie in the middle.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Herewith my companions were deceived, for they imagined nothing other but
						that the dead corpses were there. Upon the top of all there was a great
						flag, having a phoenix painted on it, perhaps the more to delude us. Here I
						had great occasion to thank God that I had seen more than the rest.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Now after the funerals were done, the Virgin, having placed herself upon
						the middlemost stone, made a short oration, that we should be constant to
						our engagements, and not repine at the pains we were hereafter to undergo,
						but be helpful in restoring the present buried Royal Persons to life again;
						and therefore without delay to rise up with her, to journey to the tower of
						Olympus, to fetch from there medicines useful and necessary for this
						purpose.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						This we soon agreed to, and followed her through another little door right
						to the shore. There the seven aforementioned ships stood all empty, on
						which the virgins stuck up their laurel branches, and after they had
						distributed us in the six ships, they caused us thus to begin our voyage in
						God's name, and looked upon us as long as they could have us in sight,
						after which they, with all the watchmen, returned into the castle. Our
						ships each had a peculiar device. Five of them indeed had the five regular
						bodies, each their own, but mine, in which the Virgin sat too, carried a
						globe. Thus we sailed on in a particular order, and each ship the Moor lay.
						In this were twelve musicians, who played excellently well, and its device
						was a pyramid. Next followed three abreast, B, C, and D, in which we were.
						I sat in C.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						In the middle behind these came the two fairest and stateliest ships, E and
						F, stuck about with many branches of laurel, having no passengers in them;
						their flags were the sun and moon. But in the rear was only one ship, G; in
						this were forty virgins.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 5: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Now having passed over this lake in this way, we first went through a
						narrow arm, into the right seas, where all the sirens, nymphs, and
						sea-goddesses were waiting for us; wherefore they immediately dispatched a
						sea-nymph to us to deliver their present and offering of honour to the
						Wedding. It was a costly, great, set, round and oriental pearl, the like of
						which has never been seen, neither in our world nor yet in the new world.
						Now the Virgin having friendlily received it, the nymph further entreated
						that audience might be given to their entertainments, and to make a little
						stand, which the Virgin was content to do, and commanded the two great
						ships to stand in the middle, and the rest to encompass them in a pentagon.
						After which the nymphs fell into a ring about, and with a most delicate
						sweet voice began to sing as follows:

						When they, with most admirable concert and melody, had finished this song,
						I no more wondered at Ulysses for stopping the ears of his companions, for
						I seemed to myself the most unhappy man alive, because nature had not made
						me, too, so trim a creature. But the Virgin soon dispatched them, and
						commanded us to set sail from there; so the nymphs went off too, after they
						had been presented with a long red scarf for a gratuity, and dispersed
						themselves in the sea.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 2

						I was at this time aware that Cupid began to work with me too, which yet
						tended by a very little towards my credit, and forasmuch as my giddiness is
						not likely to be beneficial to the reader, I am resolved to let it rest as
						it is. But this was the very wound that in the first book I received on the
						head in a dream. And let everyone take warning by me of loitering about
						Venus' bed, for Cupid can by no means brook it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						After some hours, having gone a good way in friendly discourses, we came
						within sight of the Tower of Olympus, so the Virgin commanded to give the
						signal of our approach by the discharge of some pieces, which was also
						done. And immediately we saw a great white flag thrust out, and a small
						gilded pinnace sent forth to meet us. Now as soon as this had come to us,
						we perceived in it a very ancient man, the Warder of the Tower, with
						certain guards clothed in white, by whom we were friendlily received, and
						so conducted to the Tower.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						This Tower was situated upon an island which was exactly square, and which
						was environed with a wall that was so firm and thick that I myself counted
						three hundred and sixty passes over. On the other side of the wall was a
						fine meadow with certain little gardens, in which grew strange, and to me
						unknown, fruits; and then again there was an inner wall about the Tower.
						The Tower itself was just as if seven round towers had been built one by
						another, yet the middlemost was somewhat the higher, and within they all
						entered one into another, and had seven storeys one above another. Being
						come in this way to the gates of the Tower, we were led a little aside by
						the wall, so that, as I well observed, the coffins might be brought into
						the Tower without our taking notice; of this the rest knew nothing.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						This being done, we were conducted into the Tower at the very bottom, which
						although it was excellently painted, yet we had little recreation there;
						for this was nothing but a laboratory, where we had to beat and wash
						plants, and precious stones, and all sorts of things, and extract their
						juice and essence, and put the same in glasses, and hand them over to be
						put aside. And truly our Virgin was so busy with us, and so full of her
						directions, that she knew how to give each of us enough employment, so that
						in this island we had to be mere drudges, till we had achieved all that was
						necessary for the restoring of the beheaded bodies.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Meantime (as I afterwards understood) three virgins were in the first
						apartment washing the bodies with all diligence. Now when we had at last
						almost finished this preparation of ours, nothing more was brought us but
						some broth with a little draught of wine, by which I well observed that we
						were not here for our pleasure. For when we had finished our day's work,
						too, everyone had only a mattress laid on the ground for him, with which we
						were to content ourselves.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						For my part I was not very much bothered about sleeping, and therefore
						walked out into the garden, and at length came as far as the wall; and
						because the heaven was at that time very clear, I could well drive away the
						time in contemplating the stars. By chance I came to a great pair of stone
						stairs, which led up to the top of the wall. And because the moon shone
						very bright, I was so much the more confident, and went up, and looked a
						little upon the sea too, which was now exceedingly calm.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						And thus having good opportunity to consider more about astronomy, I found
						that this present night there would occur a conjunction of the planets, the
						like of which was not otherwise usually to be observed. Now having looked a
						good while at the sea, and it being just about midnight, as soon as it had
						struck twelve I saw from afar the seven flames passing over the sea towards
						here, and taking themselves towards the top of the spire of the Tower. This
						made me somewhat afraid, for as soon as the flames had settled themselves,
						the winds arose, and began to make the sea very tempestuous. The moon also
						was covered with clouds, and my joy ended with such fear that I scarcely
						had enough time to find the stairs ended with such fear that I scarcely had
						enough time to find the stairs again, and take myself to the Tower again.
						Now whether the flames tarried any longer, or passed away again, I cannot
						say, for in this obscurity I did not dare venture abroad more.
					-
				-
					Chapter 5: Section 7: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						So I lay down on my mattress, and there being in the laboratory a pleasant
						and gently murmuring fountain, I fell asleep so much the sooner. And thus
						the fifth day too was concluded with wonders.

					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 1
				-
					-
						Next morning, after we had awakened one another, we sat together a while to
						discuss what might yet be the events to occur. For some were of the opinion
						that they should all be brought back to life again together. Others
						contradicted this, because the decease of the ancients was not only to
						restore life, but to increase it too to the young ones. Some imagined that
						they had not been put to death, but that others had been beheaded in their
						stead.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						We now having talked together a pretty long while, in came the old man, and
						first saluting us, looked about him to see if all things were ready, and
						the processes sufficiently completed. We had so conducted ourselves as
						regards this that he had no fault to find with our diligence, so he placed
						all the glasses together, and put them into a case. Presently in came
						certain youths bringing with them some ladders, ropes, and large wings,
						which they laid down before us.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Then the old man began as follows: "My dear sons, each of you must this day
						constantly bear one of these three things about with him. Now you are free
						either to make a choice of one of them, or to cast lots about it."
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						We replied, "we would choose".
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						"No," he said, "let it rather go by lot."
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Hereupon he made three little schedules. On one he wrote 'Ladder', on the
						second 'Rope', on the third 'Wings'. These he put in a hat, and each man
						must draw, and whatever he got, that was to be his. Those who got the ropes
						imagined themselves to have the best of it, but I chanced to get a ladder,
						which afflicted me greatly, for it was twelve feet long, and pretty
						weighty, and I was forced to carry it, whereas the others could handsomely
						coil their ropes about them. And as for the wings, the old man joined them
						so closely onto the third group, as if they had grown upon them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						Hereupon he turned the cock, and then the fountain no longer ran, and we
						had to remove it from the middle out of the way. After all things were
						carried off, he took leave, taking with him the casket with the glasses,
						and locked the door fast after him, so that we imagined nothing other but
						that we had been imprisoned in this Tower.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						But it was hardly a quarter of an hour before a round hole at the very top
						was uncovered, where we saw our Virgin, who called to us, and bade us good
						morrow, desiring us to come up. Those with the wings were instantly above
						and through the hole. Only those with the ropes were in an evil plight. For
						as soon as every one of us was up, he was commanded to draw up the ladder
						after him. At last each man's rope was hanged on an iron hook, so everyone
						had to climb up by his rope as well as he could, which indeed was not
						accomplished without blisters.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						Now as soon as we were all up, the hole was covered again, and we were
						friendlily received by the Virgin. This room was the whole breadth of the
						Tower itself, having six very stately vestries raised a little above the
						room, and were entered by an ascent of three steps. In these vestries we
						were placed, there to pray for the life of the King and Queen. Meanwhile
						the Virgin went in and out of the little door A, till we were ready.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						For as soon as our process was absolved, there was brought in by twelve
						persons (who were formerly our musicians), through the little door, and
						placed in the middle, a wonderful thing of longish shape, which my
						companions took only to be a fountain. But I well observed that the corpses
						lay in it, for the inner chest was of an oval figure, so large that six
						persons might well lie in it one by another. After which they again went
						forth, fetched their instruments, and conducted in our Virgin, together
						with her female attendants, with a most delicate sound of music. The Virgin
						carried a little casket, but the rest only branches and small lamps, and
						some lighted torches too. The torches were immediately given into our
						hands, and we were to stand about the fountain in this order.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						First stood the Virgin A with her attendants in a ring round about with the
						lamps and branches C. Next stood we with our torches B, then the musicians
						A in a long rank; last of all the rest of the virgins D in another long
						rank too. Now where the virgins came from, whether they lived in the
						castle, or whether they had been brought in by night, I do not know, for
						all their faces were covered with delicate white linen, so that I could not
						recognise any of them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						Hereupon the Virgin opened the casket, in which there was a round thing
						wrapped up in a piece of green double taffeta. This she laid in the
						uppermost vessel, and then covered it with the lid, which was full of
						holes, and which had besides a rim through which she poured in some of the
						water which we had prepared the day before. Then the fountain began
						immediately to run, and to flow into the little vessel through four small
						pipes. Beneath the underneath vessel there were many sharp points, on which
						the virgins stuck their lamps, so that the heat might reach the vessel, and
						make the water boil. Now the water beginning to simmer, it fell in upon the
						bodies by many little holes at A, and was so hot that it dissolved them
						all, and turned them into liquor. But what the above-mentioned round
						wrapped-up thing was, my companions did not know, but I understood that it
						was the Moor's head, from which the water drew so great a heat. At A, round
						about the great vessel, there were again many holes, in which they stuck
						their branches. Now whether this was done of necessity, or only for
						ceremony, I do not know. However, these branches were continually
						besprinkled by the fountain, and from them it afterwards dropped into the
						vessel something of a deeper yellow. This lasted for nearly two hours, the
						fountain still constantly running by itself; but the longer it ran, the
						fainter it was.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Meantime the musicians went their way, and we walked up and down in the
						room, and truly the room was made in such a way that we had opportunity
						enough to pass away our time. There were, for images, paintings,
						clockworks, organs, springing fountains, and the like, nothing forgotten.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						Now it was near the time when the fountain ceased, and would run no longer,
						when the Virgin commanded a round golden globe to be brought. But at the
						bottom of the fountain there was a tap, by which she let out all the matter
						that was dissolved by those hot drops (of which certain parts were then
						very red) into the globe. The rest of the water which remained above in the
						kettle was poured out. And so this fountain (which had now become much
						lighter) was again carried forth. Now whether it was opened elsewhere, or
						whether anything of the bodies that was further useful yet remained, I dare
						not say for certain. But this I know, that the water that was emptied into
						the globe was much heavier than six, or even more of us, were well able to
						bear, although going by its bulk it should have seemed not too heavy for
						one man. Now this globe having been got out of doors with much ado, we
						again sat alone, but I perceiving a trampling overhead, had an eye to my
						ladder.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						Here one might take notice of the strange opinions my companions had
						concerning this fountain, for they, imagining that the bodies lay in the
						garden of the castle, did not know what to make of this kind of working,
						but I thanked God that I had awakened at so opportune a time, and that I
						had seen that which helped me the better in all the Virgin's business.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						After one quarter of an hour the cover above was again lifted off, and we
						were commanded to come up, which was done as before with wings, ladders and
						ropes. And it vexed me not a little that whereas the virgins could go up
						another way, we had to take so much toil; yet I could well judge that there
						must be some special reason for it, and we must leave something for the old
						man to do too. For even those with wings had no advantage by them other
						than when they had to climb through the hole.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						Now we having got up there, and the hole having been shut again, I saw the
						globe hanging by a strong chain in the middle of the room. In this room was
						nothing but windows, and between two windows there was a door, which was
						covered with nothing other than a great polished looking-glass. And these
						windows and these looking-glasses were optically opposed to one another, so
						that although the sun (which was now shining exceedingly brightly) beat
						only upon one door, yet (after the windows towards the sun were opened, and
						the doors before the looking-glasses drawn aside) in all quarters of the
						room there were nothing but suns, which by artificial refractions beat upon
						the whole golden globe standing in the midst; and because (besides all this
						brightness) it was polished, it gave such a lustre, that none of us could
						open our eyes, but were forced to look out of the windows till the globe
						was well heated, and brought to the desired effect. Here I may well avow
						that in these mirrors I have seen the most wonderful spectacle that ever
						Nature brought to light, for there were suns in all places, and the globe
						in the middle shined still brighter, so that we could no more endure it
						than the sun itself, except for one twinkling of an eye.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						At length the Virgin commanded the looking-glasses to be shut up again, and
						the windows to be made fast, and so to let the globe cool again a little;
						and this was done about seven o'clock. This we thought good, since we might
						now have a little leisure to refresh ourselves with breakfast. This
						treatment was again right philosophical, and we had no need to be afraid of
						intemperance, yet we had no want. And the hope of the future joy (with
						which the Virgin continually comforted us) made us so jocund that we took
						no notice of any pains or inconvenience. And this I can truly say too
						concerning my companions of high quality, that their minds never ran after
						their kitchen or table, but their pleasure was only to attend upon this
						adventurous physick, and hence to contemplate the Creator's wisdom and
						omnipotency.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						After we had taken our meal, we again settled down to work, for the globe,
						which with toil and labour we were to lift off the chain and set upon the
						floor, was sufficiently cooled. Now the dispute was how to get the globe in
						half, for we were commanded to divide it in the middle. The conclusion was
						that a sharp pointed diamond would best do it. Now when we had thus opened
						the globe, there was nothing more of redness to be seen, but a lovely great
						snow-white egg. It made us rejoice most greatly that this had been brought
						to pass so well. For the Virgin was in perpetual care lest the shell might
						still be too tender. We stood round about this egg as jocund as if we
						ourselves had laid it. But the Virgin made it be carried forth, and
						departed herself, too, from us again, and (as always) locked the door. But
						what she did outside with the egg, or whether it were in some way privately
						handled, I do not know, neither do I believe it. Yet we were again to wait
						together for a quarter of an hour, till the third hole was opened, and we
						by means of our instruments came to the fourth stone or floor.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 1: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						In this room we found a great copper vessel filled with yellow sand, which
						was warmed by a gentle fire. Afterwards the egg was raked up in it, that it
						might therein come to perfect maturity. This vessel was exactly square;
						upon one side stood these two verses, written in great letters.

						Now whether the the egg were hereby meant, I leave to the learned to
						dispute; yet I do my part, and omit nothing undeclared. Our egg being now
						ready was taken out, but it needed no cracking, for the bird that was in it
						soon freed himself, and showed himself very jocund, yet he looked very
						bloody and unshapen. We first set him upon the warm sand, so the Virgin
						commanded that before we gave him anything to eat, we should be sure to
						make him fast, otherwise he would give us all work enough. This being done
						too, food was brought him, which surely was nothing else than the blood of
						the beheaded, diluted again with prepared water; by which the bird grew so
						fast under our eyes, that we saw well why the Virgin gave us such warning
						about him. He bit and scratched so devilishly about him, that could he have
						had his will upon any of us, he would have despatched him. Now he was
						wholly black, and wild, so other food was brought him, perhaps the blood of
						another of the Royal Persons; whereupon all his black feathers moulted
						again, and instead of them there grew out snow-white feathers. He was
						somewhat tamer too, and more docile. Nevertheless we did not yet trust him.
						At the third feeding his feathers began to be so curiously coloured that in
						all my life I never saw such beautiful colours. He was also exceedingly
						tame, and behaved himself so friendlily with us, that (the Virgin
						consenting) we released him from his captivity.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Our Virgin began: "Since by your diligence, and our old man's consent, the
						bird has attained both his life and the highest perfection, this is a good
						reason that he should also be joyfully consecrated by us."
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Herewith she commanded that dinner should be brought, and that we should
						again refresh ourselves, since the most troublesome part of our work was
						now over, and it was fitting that we should begin to enjoy our past
						labours. We began to make ourselves merry together. However, we still had
						all our mourning clothes on, which seemed somewhat reproachful to our
						mirth. Now the Virgin was perpetually inquisitive, perhaps to find to which
						of us her future purpose might prove serviceable. But her discourse was for
						the most part about Melting; and it pleased her well when one seemed expert
						in such compendious manuals as do particularly commend an artist. This
						dinner lasted not more than three quarters of an hour, which we still for
						the most part spent with our bird, and we had to constantly feed him with
						his food, but he still remained much the same size. After dinner we were
						not allowed long to digest our food, before the Virgin, together with the
						bird, departed from us.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						The fifth room was set open to us, where we went as before, and offered our
						services. In this room a bath was prepared for our bird, which was so
						coloured with a fine white powder that it had the appearance of milk. Now
						it was at first cool when the bird was set into it. He was mighty well
						pleased with it, drinking of it, and pleasantly sporting in it. But after
						it began to heat because of the lamps that were placed under it, we had
						enough to do to keep him in the bath. We therefore clapped a cover on the
						vessel, and allowed him to thrust his head out through a hole, till he had
						in this way lost all his feathers in the bath, and was as smooth as a
						new-born child; yet the heat did him no further harm, at which I much
						marveled, for the feathers were completely consumed in this bath, and the
						bath was thereby tinged blue. At length we gave the bird air, and he sprang
						out of the vessel of his own accord, and he was so glitteringly smooth that
						it was a pleasure to behold. But because he was still somewhat wild, we had
						to put a collar with a chain about his neck, and so led him up and down the
						room. Meanwhile a strong fire was made under the vessel, and the bath
						boiled away till it all came down to a blue stone, which we took out, and
						having first pounded it, ground it with a stone, and finally with this
						colour began to paint the bird's skin all over. Now he looked much more
						strange, for he was all blue, except the head, which remained white.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						Herewith our work on this storey was performed, and we (after the Virgin
						with her blue bird was departed from us) were called up through the hole to
						the sixth storey, where we were greatly troubled. For in the middle was
						placed a little altar, in every way like that in the King's hall above
						described. Upon this stood the six aforementioned particulars, and he
						himself (the bird) made the seventh. First of all the little fountain was
						set before him, out of which he drunk a good draught. Afterwards he pecked
						the white serpent until she bled a great deal. This blood we had to receive
						into a golden cup, and pour it down the bird's throat, who was greatly
						averse to it. Then we dipped the serpent's head in the fountain, upon which
						she revived again, and crept into her death's-head, so that I saw her no
						more for a long time after. Meantime the sphere turned constantly, until it
						made the desired conjunction. Immediately the watch struck one, upon which
						another conjunction was set going. Then the watch struck two. Finally,
						while we were observing the third conjunction, and this was indicated by
						the watch, the poor bird submissively laid down his neck upon the book of
						his own accord, and willingly allowed his head to be smitten off (by one of
						us chosen for this by lot). However, he yielded not a drop of blood until
						his breast was opened, and then the blood spurted out so fresh and clear as
						if it had been a fountain of rubies. His death went to our hearts, and yet
						we could well judge that a naked bird would stand us in little stead. So we
						let it be, and moved the little altar away and assisted the Virgin to burn
						the body to ashes (together with the little tablet hanging by) with fire
						kindled by the little taper; and afterwards to cleanse the same several
						times, and to lay them in a box of cypress wood.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						Here I cannot conceal what a trick was played on myself and three others.
						After we had thus diligently taken up the ashes, the Virgin began to speak
						as follows:
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						"My lords, here we are in the sixth room, and we have only one more before
						us, in which our trouble will be at an end, and then we shall return home
						again to our castle, to awaken our most gracious Lords and Ladies. Now I
						could heartily wish that all of you, as you are here together, had behaved
						yourselves in such a way that I might have commended to our most renowned
						King and Queen, and you might have obtained a suitable reward; yet contrary
						to my desire, I have found amongst you these four lazy and sluggish workers
						(herewith she pointed at me and three others). Yet, according to my
						goodwill to each and every one, I am not willing to deliver them up to
						deserved punishment. However, so that such negligence may not remain wholly
						unpunished, I am resolved thus concerning them, that they shall only be
						excluded from the future seventh and most glorious action of all the rest,
						and so they shall incur no further blame from their Royal Majesties."
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						In what a state we now were at this speech I leave others to consider. For
						the Virgin knew so well how to keep her countenance, that the water soon
						ran over our baskets, and we esteemed ourselves the most unhappy of all
						men. After this the Virgin caused one of her maids (of whom there were many
						always at hand) to fetch the musicians, who were to blow us out of doors
						with cornets, with such scorn and derision that they themselves could
						hardly blow for laughing. But it afflicted us particularly greatly that the
						Virgin so vehemently laughed at our weeping, anger and impatience, and that
						there might well perhaps be some amongst our companions who were glad of
						this misfortune of ours.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						But it proved otherwise, for as soon as we had come out of the door, the
						musicians told us to be of good cheer and follow them up the winding
						stairs. They led us up to the seventh floor under the roof, where we found
						the old man, whom we had not hitherto seen, standing upon a little round
						furnace. He received us friendlily, and heartily congratulated us that we
						had been chosen for this by the Virgin; but after he understood the fright
						we had received, his belly was ready to burst with laughing that we had
						taken such good fortune so badly.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						"Hence," said he, "my dear sons, learn that man never knows how well God
						intended him."
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						During this discourse the Virgin also came running in with her little box,
						and (after she had laughed at us enough) emptied her ashes into another
						vessel, and filled hers again with other stuff, saying she must now go and
						cast a mist before the other artists' eyes, and that we in the meantime
						should obey the old lord in whatsoever he commanded us, and not remit our
						former diligence. Herewith she departed from us into the seventh room into
						which she called our companions. Now what she did first with them there, I
						cannot tell, for not only were they most earnestly forbidden to speak of
						it, but we also, because of our work, did not dare peep on them through the
						ceiling.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 12
				-
					-
						But this was our work. We had to moisten the ashes with our previously
						prepared water until they became altogether like a very thin dough, after
						which we set the matter over the fire, till it was well heated. Then we
						cast it, hot like this, into two little forms or moulds, and let it cool a
						little.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 13
				-
					-
						Here we had leisure to look a while at our companions through certain
						crevices made in the floor. They were now very busy at a furnace, and each
						had to blow up the fire himself with a pipe, and they stood blowing about
						it like this, as if they were wondrously preferred before us in this. And
						this blowing lasted until our old man roused us to our work again, so that
						I cannot say what was done afterwards.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 14
				-
					-
						We opened our little forms, and there appeared two beautiful, bright and
						almost transparent little images, the like of which man's eye never saw, a
						male and a female, each of them only four inches long, and what surprised
						us most greatly was that they were not hard, but lithe and fleshy, like
						other human bodies, yet they had no life; so that I most assuredly believe
						that the Lady Venus's image was also made after some such manner.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 15
				-
					-
						These angelically fair babes we first laid upon two little satin cushions,
						and looked at them for a good while, till we were almost besotted by such
						exquisite objects. The old lord warned us to forbear, and continually to
						instil the blood of the bird (which had been received into a little golden
						cup) drop after drop into the mouths of the little images, from which they
						appeared to increase; and whereas they were before very small, they were
						now (according to proportion) much more beautiful, so that all painters
						ought to have been here, and would have been ashamed of their art in
						respect of these productions of nature. Now they began to grow so big that
						we lifted them from the little cushions, and had to lay them upon a long
						table, which was covered with white velvet. The old man also commanded us
						to cover them over up to the breast with a piece of the fine white double
						taffeta, which, because of their unspeakable beauty, almost went against
						us. But to be brief, before we had quite used up the blood in this way,
						they were already in their perfect full growth. They had golden-yellow,
						curly hair, and the above-mentioned figure of Venus was nothing to them.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 16
				-
					-
						But there was not yet any natural warmth or sensibility in them. They were
						dead figures, yet of a lively and natural colour; and since care was to be
						taken that they did not grow too big, the old man would not permit anything
						more to be given to them, but covered their faces too with the silk, and
						caused the table to be stuck round about with torches. Here I must warn the
						reader not to imagine these lights to have been put there out of necessity,
						for the old man's intent hereby was only that we should not observe when
						the soul entered into them; and indeed we should not have noticed it, had I
						not twice before seen the flames. However, I permitted the other three to
						remain with their own belief, neither did the old man know that I had seen
						anything more. Hereupon he asked us to sit down on a bench over against the
						table.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						Presently the Virgin came in too, with the music and all necessities, and
						carried two curious white garments, the like of which I had never seen in
						the castle, nor can I describe them, for I thought that they were nothing
						other than crystal; but they were soft, and not transparent; so that I
						cannot describe them. These she laid down on a table, and after she had
						disposed her virgins upon a bench round about, she and the old man began
						many slight-of-hand tricks about the table, which was done only to blind
						us. This (as I told you) was managed under the roof, which was wonderfully
						formed; for on the inside it was arched into seven hemispheres, of which
						the middlemost was somewhat the highest, and had at the top a little round
						hole, which was nevertheless shut, and was observed by no-one else.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						After many ceremonies six virgins came in, each of whom carried a large
						trumpet, around which were rolled a green, glittering and burning material
						like a wreath. The old man took one of these, and after he had removed some
						of the lights at the top of the table, and uncovered their faces, he placed
						one of the trumpets upon the mouth of one of the bodies in such a way that
						the upper and wider end of it was directed just towards the aforementioned
						hole. Here my companions always looked at the images, but I had other
						thoughts, for as soon as the foliage or wreath about the shank of the
						trumpet was kindled, I saw the hole at the top open, and a bright stream of
						fire shooting down the tube, and passing into the body; whereupon the hole
						was covered again, and the trumpet removed. With this device my companions
						were deluded, so that they imagined that life came into the image by means
						of the fire of the foliage, for as soon as he received the soul his eyes
						twinkled, although he hardly stirred. The second time he placed another
						tube upon its mouth, and kindled it again, and the soul was let down
						through the tube. This as repeated for each of them three times, after
						which all the lights were extinguished and carried away. The velvet
						coverings of the table were cast over them, and immediately a birthing bed
						was unlocked and made ready, into which, thus wrapped up, they were born.
						And after the coverings were taken off them, they were neatly laid by each
						other, and with the curtains drawn before them, they slept a good while.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						Now it was also time for the Virgin to see how other artists behaved
						themselves. They were well pleased because, as the Virgin afterwards
						informed me, they were to work in gold, which is indeed a piece of this
						art, but not the most principal, most necessary, and best. They had indeed
						too a part of these ashes, so that they imagined nothing other than that
						the whole bird was provided for the sake of gold, and that life must
						thereby be restored to the deceased.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						Meantime we sat very still, waiting for our married couple to awake. About
						half an hour was spent like this. Then the wanton Cupid presented himself
						again, and after he had saluted us all, flew to them behind the curtain,
						tormenting them until they awakened. This was a cause of great amazement to
						them, for they imagined that they had slept from the very hour in which
						they were beheaded until now. Cupid, after he had awakened them, and
						renewed their acquaintance with one another, stepped aside a little, and
						allowed them both to get themselves together a bit better, meantime playing
						his tricks with us; and at length he wanted to have the music brought in,
						to be somewhat merrier.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 21
				-
					-
						Not long after, the Virgin herself came in, and after she had most humbly
						saluted the young King and Queen (who found themselves rather faint) and
						kissed their hands, she brought them the two aforementioned strange
						garments, which they put on, and so stepped forth. Now there were already
						prepared two very strange chairs, in which they placed themselves. And they
						were congratulated with most profound reverence by us, for which the King
						himself most graciously returned his thanks, and again reassured us of all
						grace.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 22
				-
					-
						It was already about five o'clock, so they could no longer stay, but as
						soon as the best of their furniture could be laden, we had to attend the
						young Royal Persons down the winding stairs, through all doors and watches
						to the ship. In this they embarked, together with certain virgins and
						Cupid, and sailed so very swiftly that we soon lost sight of them; but they
						were met (as I was informed) by certain stately ships. Thus in four hours'
						time they had gone many leagues out to sea. After five o'clock the
						musicians were charged to carry all things back again to the ships, and to
						make themselves ready for the voyage. But because this took rather a long
						time, the old lord commanded a party of his concealed soldiers to come out.
						They had hitherto been planted in a wall, so that we had not noticed any of
						them, whereby I observed that this Tower was well provided against
						opposition. Now these soldiers made quick work with our stuff, so that
						nothing more remained to be done but to go to supper.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 23
				-
					-
						The table being completely furnished, the Virgin brought us again to our
						companions, where we were to carry ourselves as if we had truly been in a
						lamentable condition, and forbear laughing. But they were always smiling to
						one another, although some of them sympathised with us too. At this supper
						the old lord was also with us, who was a most sharp inspector over us; for
						no-one could propound anything so discreetly, but he knew either how to
						confute it, or to amend it, or at least to give some good information on
						it. I learned a great deal from this lord, and it would be very good if
						each one would apply themselves to him, and take notice of his procedure,
						for then things would not miscarry so often and so unfortunately.
					-
				-
					Chapter 6: Section 10: Paragraph 24
				-
					-
						After we had taken our nocturnal refreshment, the old lord took us into his
						closets of rarities, which were dispersed here and there amongst the
						bulwarks; where we saw such wonderful productions of Nature, and other
						things too which man's wit, in imitation of Nature, had invented, that we
						needed another year to survey them sufficiently. Thus we spent a good part
						of the night by candlelight. At last, because we were more inclined to
						sleep than to see many rarities, we were lodged in rooms in the wall, where
						we had not only costly and good beds, but also extraordinarily handsome
						chambers, which made us wonder all the more why we were forced to undergo
						so many hardships the day before. In this chamber I had good rest, and
						being for the most part without care, and weary with continual labour, the
						gentle rushing of the sea helped me to a sound and sweet sleep, for I
						continued in one dream from eleven o'clock till eight in the morning.

						After eight o'clock I woke up, and quickly made myself ready, wanting to
						return again into the Tower; but the dark passages in the wall were so many
						and various, that I wandered a good while before I could find the way out.
						The same happened to the rest too, till at last we all met again in the
						nethermost vault, and entirely yellow apparel was given to us, together
						with our golden fleeces. At this time the Virgin declared to us that we
						were Knights of the Golden Stone, of which we were before ignorant.

					Chapter 7: Section 1: Paragraph 2

						After we had made ourselves ready, and taken our breakfast, the old man

						He exhorted us moreover that we should try to take nothing more than this
						token of remembrance. Herewith we went forth to the sea, where our ships
						lay, so richly equipped that it was not possible but that such amazing
						things must first have been brought there. The ships were twelve in number,
						six of ours, and six of the old lord's, who caused his ships to be
						freighted with well appointed soldiers. But he himself came to us in our
						ship, where we were all together. In the first the musicians, of which the
						old lord also had a great number, seated themselves; they sailed before us
						to shorten the time. Our flags were the twelve celestial signs, and we sat
						in Libra. Besides other things our ship also had a noble and curious clock,
						which showed us all the minutes. The sea was so calm, too, that it was a
						singular pleasure to sail. But what surpassed all the rest was the old
						man's discourse; he knew so well how to pass away our time with wonderful
						stories, that I could have been content to sail with him all my life long.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						Meanwhile the ships passed on in haste, for before we had sailed two hours
						the mariner told us that he already saw the whole lake almost covered with
						ships, by which we could conjecture that they had come out to meet us,
						which proved true. For as soon as we had come out of the sea into the lake
						by the aforementioned river, there before us were five hundred ships, one
						of which sparkled with gold and precious stones, and in which sat the King
						and Queen, together with other lords, ladies, and virgins of high birth. As
						soon as they were well in sight of us the pieces were discharged on both
						sides, and there was such a din of trumpets, shalms, and kettle drums that
						all the ships upon the sea capered again. Finally, as soon as we came near
						they brought our ships together, and so made a stand.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Immediately the old Atlas stepped forth on the King's behalf, making a
						short but handsome oration, in which he welcomed us, and asked whether the
						Royal Presents were ready. The rest of my companions were in great
						amazement, where this King should come from, for they imagined nothing
						other than that they would have to awaken him again. We allowed them to
						continue in their amazement, and acted as if it seemed strange to us too.
						After Atlas' oration out stepped our old man, making a rather longer reply,
						in which he wished the King and Queen all happiness and increase, after
						which he delivered up a curious small casket. What was in it, I do not
						know, but it was committed to Cupid to keep, who hovered between the King
						and Queen.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						After the oration was finished, they again let off a joyful volley of shot,
						and so we sailed on a good time together, till at length we arrived at
						another shore. This was near the first gate at which I first entered. At
						this place again there attended a great multitude of the King's family
						together with some hundreds of horses. Now as soon as we came to shore, and
						disembarked, the King and Queen presented their hands to all of us, every
						one, with singular kindness; and so we were to get up on horseback.

						Here I wish to friendlily entreat the reader not to interpret the following
						narration as any vain glory or pride of mine, but to credit me this much,
						that if there had not been a special necessity for it, I could very well
						have utterly concealed this honour which was shown me. We were all one
						after another distributed amongst the lords. But our old lord, and I, most
						unworthy, were to ride alongside the King, each of us bearing a snow-white
						ensign with a red cross. Indeed, I was made use of because of my age, for
						we both had long grey beards and hair. I had also fastened my tokens about
						my hat, which the young King soon noticed, and asked if I were he who could
						redeem these tokens at the gate?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						I answered in most humble manner, "Yes".
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 7
				-
					-
						But he laughed at me, saying, "There was no need for ceremony; I was HIS
						father".
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 8
				-
					-
						Then he asked me with what I had redeemed them?
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 9
				-
					-
						I replied, "With Water and Salt".
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 10
				-
					-
						Whereupon he wondered who had made me so wise; upon which I grew a bit more
						confident, and recounted to him how it had happened with my bread, the Dove
						and the Raven, and he was pleased with it and said expressly that it must
						be that God had herein vouchsafed me a singular happiness.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 11
				-
					-
						With this we came to the first gate where the Porter with the blue clothes
						waited, bearing in his hand a supplication. Now as soon as he saw me
						alongside the King, he delivered me the supplication, most humbly
						beseeching me to mention his ingenuity to the King. Now in the first place
						I asked the King what the condition of this porter was. He friendlily
						answered me, that he was a very famous and rare astrologer, and always in
						high regard with the Lord his Father, but having once committed a fault
						against Venus, and seen her in her bed of rest, this punishment was
						therefore imposed upon him, that he should wait at the first gate for so
						long until someone should release him from it.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 12

					-
						I replied, "May he then be released?"

						"Yes," said the King, "if anyone can be found that has transgressed as
						highly as himself, he must take his place, and the other shall be free."

						This went to my heart, for my conscience convinced me that I was the
						offender, yet I kept quiet, and herewith delivered the supplication. As
						soon as he had read it, he was greatly terrified, so that the Queen (who
						with our virgins, and that other Duchess as well - whom I mentioned at the
						hanging of the weights - rode just behind us) observed this, and therefore
						asked him what this letter might mean. But he had no mind to take any
						notice of it, and putting away the paper, began to talk about other
						matters, till thus in about three hours' time we came to the castle, where
						we alighted, and waited upon the King as he went into his hall.

					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 15

						Immediately the King called for the old Atlas to come to him in a little
						closet, and showed him the writing, and Atlas did not tarry, but rode out
						again to the Porter to get more information on the matter. After this the
						young King, with his spouse, and the other lords, ladies and virgins, sat
						down. Then our Virgin began to highly commend the diligence we had shown,
						and the pains and labour we had undergone, requesting that we might be
						royally rewarded, and that she might be permitted to enjoy the benefit of
						her commission from then on. Then the old lord stood up too, and attested
						that all the Virgin had said was true, and that it was only just that we
						should both be contented on both our parts. Hereupon we were to step
						forward a little, and it was concluded that each man should make some
						possible wish, and accordingly obtain it; for it was not to be doubted that
						those of understanding would also make the best wish. So we were to
						consider it until after supper.

					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 16

					-
						Meantime the King and Queen, for recreation's sake, began to play together,
						at something which looked not unlike chess, only it had different rules;
						for it was the Virtues and Vices one against another, and it might
						ingeniously be observed with what plots the Vices lay in wait for the
						Virtues, and how to re-encounter them again. This was so properly and
						cleverly performed, that it is to be wished that we had the same game too.
						During the game, in came Atlas again, and made his report in private, but I
						blushed all over, for my conscience gave me no rest.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 17
				-
					-
						After this the King gave me the supplication to read, and the contents of
						it were much to this purpose. First he (the doorkeeper) wished the King
						prosperity, and increase, and that his seed might be spread abroad far and
						wide. Afterwards he remonstrated that the time was now come in which
						according to the royal promise he ought to be released, because Venus had
						already been uncovered by one of his guests, for his observations could not
						lie to him. And that if his Majesty would be pleased to make a strict and
						diligent enquiry, he would find that she had been uncovered, and if this
						should not prove to be so, he would be content to remain before the gate
						all the days of his life. Then he asked in the most humble manner, that
						upon peril of body and life he might be permitted to be present at this
						night's supper. He was hoping to seek out the very offender, and obtain his
						desired freedom. This was expressly and handsomely indicated, by which I
						could well perceive his ingenuity, but it was too sharp for me, and I would
						not have minded if I had never seen it. Now I was wondering whether he
						might perhaps be helped through my wish, so I asked the King whether he
						might not be released some other way.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 18
				-
					-
						"No," replied the King, "because there is a special consideration in the
						business. However, for this night, we may well gratify him in his desire."
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 19
				-
					-
						So he sent someone to fetch him in. Meanwhile the tables were prepared in a
						spacious room, in which we had never been before, which was so perfect, and
						contrived in such a manner, that it is not possible for me even to begin to
						describe it. We were conducted into this with singular pomp and ceremony.
						Cupid was not at this time present, for (as I was informed) the disgrace
						which had happened to his mother had somewhat angered him. In brief, my
						offence, and the supplication which was delivered, were an occasion of much
						sadness, for the King was in perplexity how to make inquisition amongst his
						guests, and the more so because through this, even they who were yet
						ignorant of the matter would come to know about it. So he caused the Porter
						himself, who had already arrived, to make his strict survey, and he himself
						acted as pleasantly as he was able.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 20
				-
					-
						However, eventually they all began to be merry again, and to talk to one
						another with all sorts of recreative and profitable discourses. Now, how
						the treatment and other ceremonies were then performed, it is not necessary
						to declare, since it is neither the reader's concern, nor serviceable to my
						design. But all exceeded more in art, and human invention, than we exceeded
						in drinking! And this was the last and noblest meal at which I was present.
						After the banquet the tables were suddenly taken away, and certain curious
						chairs placed round about in a circle, in which we, together with the King
						and Queen, and both their old men and the ladies and virgins, were to sit.

					Chapter 7: Section 4: Paragraph 21

						After this, a very handsome page opened the above-mentioned glorious little
						book, and Atlas immediately placed himself in the midst, and began to speak
						to this purpose: that his Royal Majesty had not forgotten the service we
						had done him, and how carefully we had attended to our duty, and therefore
						by way of retribution had elected all and each of us Knights of the Golden
						Stone. And that it was therefore further necessary not only once again to
						oblige ourselves towards his Royal Majesty, but also to vow to the
						following articles; and then his Royal Majesty would likewise know how to
						behave himself towards his liege people. Upon which he caused the page to
						read over the articles, which were these.

						You my lords the Knights shall swear that you shall at no time ascribe your

						That you will abominate all whoredom, incontinency and uncleanness, and not

						At this last article we could not choose but laugh, and it may well have
						been placed after the rest only for a conceit. Now after vowing to them all
						by the King's sceptre, we were afterwards installed Knights with the usual
						ceremonies, and amongst other privileges set over Ignorance, Poverty, and
						Sickness, to handle them at our pleasure. And this was afterwards ratified
						in a little chapel (to which we were conducted in procession) and thanks
						returned to God for it. I also hung up there at that time my golden fleece
						and hat, and left them there for an eternal memorial, to the honour of God.
						And because everyone had to write his name there, I wrote thus:

						Others wrote likewise, each as it seemed good to him. After this, we were
						again brought into the hall, where, having sat down, we were admonished
						quickly to think what we each one would wish. But the King and his party
						retired into a little closet, there to give audience to our wishes. Now
						each man was called in separately, so that I cannot speak of any man's own
						wish. I thought nothing could be more praiseworthy than to demonstrate some
						laudable virtue in honour of my order, and found too that none at present
						could be better, and cost me more trouble, than Gratitude. Wherefore in
						spite of the fact that I might well have wished something more dear and
						agreeable to myself, I vanquished myself, and concluded, even at my own
						peril, to free the Porter, my benefactor.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 8: Paragraph 2
				-
					-
						So as I was now called in, I was first of all asked whether, having read
						the supplication, I had observed or suspected nothing concerning the
						offender? Upon which I began undauntedly to relate how all the business had
						passed, how through ignorance I fell into that mistake, and so offered
						myself to undergo all that I had thereby deserved. The King, and the rest
						of the lords, wondered greatly at so unexpected a confession, and so asked
						me to step aside a little.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 8: Paragraph 3
				-
					-
						Now as soon as I was called in again, Atlas declared to me that although it
						was grievous to the King's Majesty that I, whom he loved above others, had
						fallen into such a mischance, yet because it was not possible for him to
						transgress his ancient usages, he did not know how to absolve me; the other
						must be at liberty, and I put in his place; yet he would hope that some
						other would be apprehended, so that I might be able to go home again.
						However, no release was to be hoped for, till the marriage feast of his
						future son.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 8: Paragraph 4
				-
					-
						This sentence had nearly cost me my life, and I first hated myself and my
						twaddling tongue, in that I could not keep quiet; yet at last I took
						courage, and because I thought there was no remedy, I related how this
						Porter had bestowed a token on me, and commended me to the other, by whose
						assistance I stood upon the scale, and so was made partaker of all the
						honour and joy already received. And therefore now it was but fair that I
						should show myself grateful to my benefactor, and because this could not be
						done in any other way, I returned thanks for the sentence, and was willing
						gladly to bear some inconvenience for the sake of he who had been helpful
						to me in coming to such a high place. But if by my wish anything might be
						effected, I wished myself at home again, so that he by me, and I by my wish
						might be at liberty. Answer was made me, that the wishing did not stretch
						so far. However, I might wish him free. Yet it was very pleasing to his
						Royal Majesty that I had behaved myself so generously in this, but he was
						afraid I might still be ignorant of what a miserable condition I had
						plunged myself into through my curiosity. Hereupon the good man was
						pronounced free, and I with a sad heart had to step aside.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 8: Paragraph 5
				-
					-
						After me the rest were called for too, and came jocundly out again, which
						pained me still more, for I imagined nothing other than that I must finish
						my life under the gate. I also had many pensive thoughts running up and
						down in my head, what I should do, and how to spend the time. At length I
						considered that I was now old, and according to the course of nature, had
						few years more to live. And that this anguished and melancholy life would
						quickly send me from this world, and then my door-keeping would be at an
						end, and by a most happy sleep I might quickly bring myself to the grave. I
						had many of these thoughts. Sometimes it vexed me that I had seen such
						gallant things, and must be robbed of them. Sometimes I rejoiced that
						still, before my end, I had been accepted to all joy, and should not be
						forced to depart shamefully. This was the last and worst shock that I
						sustained.
					-
				-
					Chapter 7: Section 8: Paragraph 6
				-
					-
						During my cogitations the rest had got ready. So after they had received a
						good night from the King and lords, each one was conducted into his
						lodging. But I, most wretched man, had nobody to show me the way, and must
						moreover suffer myself to be tormented; and so that I might be certain of
						my future function, I had to put on the ring which the other had worn
						before. Finally, the King exhorted me that since this was now the last time
						I was likely to see him in this manner, I should behave myself according to
						my place, and not against the order. Upon which he took me in his arms, and
						kissed me, all which I understood to mean that in the morning I must sit at
						my gate. Now after they had all spoken friendlily to me for a while, and at
						last given their hands, committing me to the Divine protection, I was
						conducted by both the old men, the Lord of the Tower, and Atlas, into a
						glorious lodging, in which stood three beds, and each of us lay in one of
						them, where we spent almost two, &c.....
