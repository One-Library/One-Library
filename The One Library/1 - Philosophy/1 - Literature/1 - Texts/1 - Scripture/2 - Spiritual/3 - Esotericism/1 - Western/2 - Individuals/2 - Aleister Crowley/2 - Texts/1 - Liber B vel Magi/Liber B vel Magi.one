			Item 1 - 00.
		-
			-
				One is the Magus; twain His forces; four His weapons. These are the Seven Spirits
				of Unrighteousness; seven vultures of evil. Thus is the art and craft of the Magus
				but glamour. How shall He destroy Himself?
			-
		-
			Item 2 - 0.
		-
			-
				Yet the Magus hath power upon the Mother both directly and through Love. And the
				Magus is Love, and bindeth together That and This in his conjuration.
			-
		-
			Item 3 - 1.
		-
			-
				In the beginning doth the Magus speak Truth, and send forth Illusion and Falsehood
				to enslave the soul. Yet therein is the Mystery of Redemption.
			-
		-
			Item 4 - 2.
		-
			-
				By His Wisdom made He the Worlds; the Word that is God is none other than He.
			-
		-
			Item 5 - 3.
		-
			-
				How then shall He end His speech with Silence? For He is Speech.
			-
		-
			Item 6 - 4.
		-
			-
				He is the first and the last. How shall He cease to number Himself?
			-
		-
			Item 7 - 5.
		-
			-
				By a Magus is this writing made known through the mind of a Magister. The one
				uttereth clearly, and the other understandeth; yet the Word is falsehood, and the
				Understanding darkness. And this saying is Of All Truth.
			-
		-
			Item 8 - 6.
		-
			-
				Nevertheless it is written; for there be times of darkness, and this as a lamp
				therein.
			-
		-
			Item 9 - 7.
		-
			-
				With the Wand createth He.
			-
		-
			Item 10 - 8.
		-
			-
				With the Cup preserveth He.
			-
		-
			Item 11 - 9.
		-
			-
				With the Dagger destroyeth He.
			-
		-
			Item 12 - 10.
		-
			-
				With the Coin redeemeth He.
			-
		-
			Item 13 - 11.
		-
			-
				His weapons fulfil the wheel; and on What Axle that turneth is not known unto Him.
			-
		-
			Item 14 - 12.
		-
			-
				From all these actions must He cease before the curse of His Grade is uplifted from
				Him. Before He attain to That which existeth without Form.
			-
		-
			Item 15 - 13.
		-
			-
				And if at this time He be manifested upon earth as a Man, and therefore is this
				present writing, let this be His method, that the curse of His grade, and the
				burden of His attainment, be uplifted from Him.
			-
		-
			Item 16 - 14.
		-
			-
				Let Him beware of abstinence from action. For the curse of His grade is that He
				must speak Truth, that the Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of men. Let him
				then utter that without Fear, that the Law may be fulfilled. And according to His
				Original Nature will that law be shapen, so that one may declare gentleness and
				quietness, being an Hindu; and another fierceness and servility, being a Jew; and
				yet another ardour and manliness, being an Arab. Yet this matter toucheth the
				mystery of Incarnation, and is not here to be declared.
			-
		-
			Item 17 - 15.
		-
			-
				Now the grade of a Magister teacheth the Mystery of Sorrow, and the grade of a
				Magus the Mystery of Change, and the grade of Ipsissimus the Mystery of
				Selflessness, which is called also the Mystery of Pan.
			-
		-
			Item 18 - 16.
		-
			-
				Let the Magus then contemplate each in turn, raising it to the ultimate power of
				Infinity. Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness is Self.
				For the interplay of the parts hath no action upon the whole. And this
				contemplation shall be performed not by simple meditation— how much less then by
				reason? but by the method which shall have been given unto Him in His Initiation to
				the Grade.
			-
		-
			Item 19 - 17.
		-
			-
				Following which method, it shall be easy for Him to combine that trinity from its
				elements, and further to combine Sat-Chit-Ananda, and Light, Love, Life, three by
				three into nine that are one, in which meditation success shall be That which was
				first adumbrated to Him in the grade of Practicus (which reflecteth Mercury into
				the lowest world) in Liber XXVII, “Here is Nothing under its three Forms.”
			-
		-
			Item 20 - 18.
		-
			-
				And this is the Opening of the Grade of Ipsissimus, and by the Buddhists it is
				called the trance Nerodha-Samapatti.
			-
		-
			Item 21 - 19.
		-
			-
				And woe, woe, woe, yea woe, and again woe, woe, woe unto seven times be His that
				preacheth not His law to men!
			-
		-
			Item 22 - 20.
		-
			-
				And woe also be unto Him that refuseth the curse of the grade of a Magus, and the
				burden of the Attainment thereof.
			-
		-
			Item 23 - 21.
		-
			-
				And in the word CHAOS let the Book be sealed; yea, let the Book be sealed.
