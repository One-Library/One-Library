	-
		Principles

		-
			An Ordinance for the government of the Territory of the United States northwest of the
			River Ohio.
		-
		-
			Section 1.
		-
			-
				Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled, That the said territory,
				for the purposes of temporary government, be one district, subject, however, to be
				divided into two districts, as future circumstances may, in the opinion of
				Congress, make it expedient.
			-
		-
			Sec 2.
		-
			-
				Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the estates, both of resident and
				nonresident proprietors in the said territory, dying intestate, shall descent to,
				and be distributed among their children, and the descendants of a deceased child,
				in equal parts; the descendants of a deceased child or grandchild to take the share
				of their deceased parent in equal parts among them: And where there shall be no
				children or descendants, then in equal parts to the next of kin in equal degree;
				and among collaterals, the children of a deceased brother or sister of the
				intestate shall have, in equal parts among them, their deceased parents' share; and
				there shall in no case be a distinction between kindred of the whole and half
				blood; saving, in all cases, to the widow of the intestate her third part of the
				real estate for life, and one third part of the personal estate; and this law
				relative to descents and dower, shall remain in full force until altered by the
				legislature of the district. And until the governor and judges shall adopt laws as
				hereinafter mentioned, estates in the said territory may be devised or bequeathed
				by wills in writing, signed and sealed by him or her in whom the estate may be
				(being of full age), and attested by three witnesses; and real estates may be
				conveyed by lease and release, or bargain and sale, signed, sealed and delivered by
				the person being of full age, in whom the estate may be, and attested by two
				witnesses, provided such wills be duly proved, and such conveyances be
				acknowledged, or the execution thereof duly proved, and be recorded within one year
				after proper magistrates, courts, and registers shall be appointed for that
				purpose; and personal property may be transferred by delivery; saving, however to
				the French and Canadian inhabitants, and other settlers of the Kaskaskies, St.
				Vincents and the neighboring villages who have heretofore professed themselves
				citizens of Virginia, their laws and customs now in force among them, relative to
				the descent and conveyance, of property.

				district, and have a freehold estate therein in 1,000 acres of land, while in the
				exercise of his office.

			Sec. 4.

				There shall be appointed from time to time by Congress, a secretary, whose
				commission shall continue in force for four years unless sooner revoked; he shall

				while in the exercise of his office. It shall be his duty to keep and preserve the
				acts and laws passed by the legislature, and the public records of the district,
				and the proceedings of the governor in his executive department, and transmit
				authentic copies of such acts and proceedings, every six months, to the Secretary
				of Congress: There shall also be appointed a court to consist of three judges, any
				two of whom to form a court, who shall have a common law jurisdiction, and reside
				in the district, and have each therein a freehold estate in 500 acres of land while
				in the exercise of their offices; and their commissions shall continue in force
				during good behavior.

				district such laws of the original States, criminal and civil, as may be necessary
				and best suited to the circumstances of the district, and report them to Congress
				from time to time: which laws shall be in force in the district until the
				organization of the General Assembly therein, unless disapproved of by Congress;
				but afterwards the Legislature shall have authority to alter them as they shall
				think fit.

				Previous to the organization of the general assembly, the governor shall appoint
				such magistrates and other civil officers in each county or township, as he shall
				find necessary for the preservation of the peace and good order in the same: After
				the general assembly shall be organized, the powers and duties of the magistrates
				and other civil officers shall be regulated and defined by the said assembly; but
				all magistrates and other civil officers not herein otherwise directed, shall
				during the continuance of this temporary government, be appointed by the governor.

				from time to time as circumstances may require, to lay out the parts of the
				district in which the Indian titles shall have been extinguished, into counties and
				townships, subject, however, to such alterations as may thereafter be made by the
				legislature.

			Sec. 9.

				male inhabitants, there shall be one representative, and so on progressively with
				the number of free male inhabitants shall the right of representation increase,
				until the number of representatives shall amount to twenty five; after which, the
				number and proportion of representatives shall be regulated by the legislature:
				Provided, That no person be eligible or qualified to act as a representative unless
				he shall have been a citizen of one of the United States three years, and be a
				resident in the district, or unless he shall have resided in the district three
				years; and, in either case, shall likewise hold in his own right, in fee simple,
				two hundred acres of land within the same; Provided, also, That a freehold in fifty
				acres of land in the district, having been a citizen of one of the states, and
				being resident in the district, or the like freehold and two years residence in the
				district, shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector of a representative.

			Sec. 10.

				The representatives thus elected, shall serve for the term of two years; and, in
				case of the death of a representative, or removal from office, the governor shall

				in his stead, to serve for the residue of the term.

				possessed of a freehold in five hundred acres of land, and return their names to
				Congress; five of whom Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as aforesaid;
				and, whenever a vacancy shall happen in the council, by death or removal from
				office, the house of representatives shall nominate two persons, qualified as
				aforesaid, for each vacancy, and return their names to Congress; one of whom
				congress shall appoint and commission for the residue of the term. And every five
				years, four months at least before the expiration of the time of service of the
				members of council, the said house shall nominate ten persons, qualified as
				aforesaid, and return their names to Congress; five of whom Congress shall appoint
				and commission to serve as members of the council five years, unless sooner
				removed. And the governor, legislative council, and house of representatives, shall
				have authority to make laws in all cases, for the good government of the district,
				not repugnant to the principles and articles in this ordinance established and
				declared. And all bills, having passed by a majority in the house, and by a
				majority in the council, shall be referred to the governor for his assent; but no
				bill, or legislative act whatever, shall be of any force without his assent. The
				governor shall have power to convene, prorogue, and dissolve the general assembly,
				when, in his opinion, it shall be expedient.

				provide also for the establishment of States, and permanent government therein, and
				for their admission to a share in the federal councils on an equal footing with the
				original States, at as early periods as may be consistent with the general
				interest:

			Sec. 14.

				by common consent, to wit:
			-
				-
					Art. 1.
				-
					-
						No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner, shall ever
						be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments, in
						the said territory.

						benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury; of a
						proportionate representation of the people in the legislature; and of
						judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law. All persons
						shall be bailable, unless for capital offenses, where the proof shall be
						evident or the presumption great. All fines shall be moderate; and no cruel
						or unusual punishments shall be inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his
						liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the
						land; and, should the public exigencies make it necessary, for the common
						preservation, to take any person's property, or to demand his particular
						services, full compensation shall be made for the same. And, in the just
						preservation of rights and property, it is understood and declared, that no
						law ought ever to be made, or have force in the said territory, that shall,
						in any manner whatever, interfere with or affect private contracts or
						engagements, bona fide, and without fraud, previously formed.
					-
				-
					Art. 3.
				-
					-
						Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and
						the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever
						be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the
						Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without
						their consent; and, in their property, rights, and liberty, they shall
						never be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized by
						Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity, shall from time to time
						be made for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace
						and friendship with them.
					-
				-
					Art. 4.

					-
						The said territory, and the States which may be formed therein, shall
						forever remain a part of this Confederacy of the United States of America,
						subject to the Articles of Confederation, and to such alterations therein
						as shall be constitutionally made; and to all the acts and ordinances of
						the United States in Congress assembled, conformable thereto. The
						inhabitants and settlers in the said territory shall be subject to pay a
						part of the federal debts contracted or to be contracted, and a
						proportional part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned on them
						by Congress according to the same common rule and measure by which
						apportionments thereof shall be made on the other States; and the taxes for
						paying their proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and
						direction of the legislatures of the district or districts, or new States,
						as in the original States, within the time agreed upon by the United States
						in Congress assembled. The legislatures of those districts or new States,
						shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United
						States in Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find
						necessary for securing the title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers.
						No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States; and, in
						no case, shall nonresident proprietors be taxed higher than residents. The
						navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the
						carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever
						free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens
						of the United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted
						into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.
					-
				-
					Art. 5.

					-
						There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three nor more
						than five States; and the boundaries of the States, as soon as Virginia
						shall alter her act of cession, and consent to the same, shall become fixed
						and established as follows, to wit: The western State in the said
						territory, shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and Wabash
						Rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and Post Vincents, due North,
						to the territorial line between the United States and Canada; and, by the
						said territorial line, to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The middle
						State shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash from Post
						Vincents to the Ohio, by the Ohio, by a direct line, drawn due north from
						the mouth of the Great Miami, to the said territorial line, and by the said
						territorial line. The eastern State shall be bounded by the last mentioned
						direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line:
						Provided, however, and it is further understood and declared, that the
						boundaries of these three States shall be subject so far to be altered,
						that, if Congress shall hereafter find it expedient, they shall have
						authority to form one or two States in that part of the said territory
						which lies north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend
						or extreme of Lake Michigan. And, whenever any of the said States shall
						have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted,
						by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal
						footing with the original States in all respects whatever, and shall be at
						liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided,
						the constitution and government so to be formed, shall be republican, and
						in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so far as
						it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such
						admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a
						less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.
					-
				-
					Art. 6.
				-
					-
						There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said
						territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party
						shall have been duly convicted: Provided, always, That any person escaping
						into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of
						the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed
						to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.
