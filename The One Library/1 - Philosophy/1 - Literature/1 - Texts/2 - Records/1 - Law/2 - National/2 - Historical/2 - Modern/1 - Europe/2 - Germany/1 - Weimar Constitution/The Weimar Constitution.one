						modifying the constitution.
					-
					-
						Where the states directly affected consent, an ordinary national law shall
						suffice.
					-

						affected does not consent, but where the alteration of a boundary or the
						creation of a new state is demanded by the wishes of the population and an
						overwhelming national interest requires it.
					-
					-
						The wishes of the population shall be ascertained by a referendum. The
						National Ministry shall order such a referendum to take place upon demand
						of one-third of the residents of the territory to be separated who are
						qualified to vote for members of the Reichstag.
					-
					-
						Three-fifths of the votes recorded, and at least a majority of the total
						number of electors, are necessary to effect any alteration of boundaries or
						the creation of a new state. Even for the separation of only a part of a
						Prussian governmental district or of a corresponding administrative
						district in any other state, the wishes of the population of the whole
						district affected must be ascertained. If there is no geographical
						connection between the portion to be separated and the whole district, a
						special national law may declare that the wishes of the population of the
						part to be separated shall be sufficient.
					-
					-
						When the wishes of the population have been ascertained, the National
						Ministry shall submit an appropriate law to the Reichstag for its
						acceptance.
					-
					-

						state, the Supreme Judicial Court of the German Reich shall decide the
						controversy on the appeal of either of the contesting parties, if no other
						court of the Reich is competent. The President of the Reich shall execute
						the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court.
