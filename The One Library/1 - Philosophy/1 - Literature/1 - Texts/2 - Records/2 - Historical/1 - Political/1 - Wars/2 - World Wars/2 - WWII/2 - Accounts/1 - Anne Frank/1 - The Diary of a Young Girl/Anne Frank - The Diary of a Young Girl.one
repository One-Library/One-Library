				Entry 1 - June 12, 1942: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able
					to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and
					support.

				Entry 1 - June 12, 1942: Paragraph 2 - COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1942
			-
				-
					So far you truly have been a great source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty,
					whom I now write to regularly. This way of keeping a diary is much nicer, and
					now I can hardly wait for those moments when I'm able to write in you. Oh, I'm
					so glad I brought you along!

				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					I'll begin from the moment I got you, the moment I saw you lying on the table
					among my other birthday presents. (I went along when you were bought, but that
					doesn't count.)
				-
			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					On Friday, June 12, I was awake at six o'clock, which isn't surprising, since
					it was my birthday. But I'm not allowed to get up at that hour, so I had to
					control my curiosity until quarter to seven. When I couldn't wait any longer, I
					went to the dining room, where Moortje (the cat) welcomed me by rubbing against
					my legs.
				-
			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					A little after seven I went to Daddy and Mama and then to the living room to
					open my presents, and you were the first thing I saw, maybe one of my nicest
					presents.
				-
			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Then a bouquet of roses, some peonies and a potted plant. From Daddy and Mama I
					got a blue blouse, a game, a bottle of grape juice, which to my mind tastes a
					bit like wine (after all, wine is made from grapes), a puzzle, a jar of cold
					cream, 2.50 guilders and a gift certificate for two books. I got another book
					as well, Camera Obscura (but Margot already has it, so I exchanged mine for
					something else), a platter of homemade cookies (which I made myself, of course,
					since I've become quite an expert at baking cookies), lots of candy and a
					strawberry tart from Mother. And a letter from Grammy, right on time, but of
					course that was just a coincidence.
				-
			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Then Hanneli came to pick me up, and we went to school. During recess I passed
					out cookies to my teachers and my class, and then it was time to get back to
					work. I didn't arrive home until five, since I went to gym with the rest of the
					class. (I'm not allowed to take part because my shoulders and hips tend to get
					dislocated.) As it was my birthday, I got to decide which game my classmates
					would play, and I chose volleyball. Afterward they all danced around me in a
					circle and sang "Happy Birthday." When I got home, Sanne Federmann was already
					there. Ilse Wagner, Hanneli Goslar and Jacqueline van Maarsen came home with me
					after gym, since we're in the same class. Hanneli and Sanne used to be my two
					best friends. People who saw us together used to say, "There goes Anne, Hanne
					and Sanne." I only met Jacqueline van Maarsen when I started at the Jewish
					Fyceum, and now she's my best friend. Ilse is Hanneli's best friend, and Sanne
					goes to another school and has friends there.

			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					They gave me a beautiful book, Dutch Sasas and Lesends, but they gave me Volume
					II by mistake, so I exchanged two other books for Volume I. Aunt Helene brought
					me a puzzle, Aunt Stephanie a darling brooch and Aunt Deny a terrific book:
					Daisy Goes to the Mountains.
				-
			-
				Entry 2 - SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					This morning I lay in the bathtub thinking how wonderful it would be if I had a
					dog like Rin Tin Tin. I'd call him Rin Tin Tin too, and I'd take him to school
					with me, where he could stay in the janitor's room or by the bicycle racks when
					the weather was good.

			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					I had my birthday party on Sunday afternoon. The Rin Tin Tin movie was a big
					hit with my classmates. I got two brooches, a bookmark and two books. I'll
					start by saying a few things about my school and my class, beginning with the
					students.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Betty Bloemendaal looks kind of poor, and I think she probably is. She lives on
					some obscure street in West Amsterdam, and none of us know where it is. She
					does very well at school, but that's because she works so hard, not because
					she's so smart. She's pretty quiet.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Jacqueline van Maarsen is supposedly my best friend, but I've never had a real
					friend. At first I thought Jacque would be one, but I was badly mistaken.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					D. Q.* [* Initials have been assigned at random to those persons who prefer to
					remain anonymous.] is a very nervous girl who's always forgetting things, so
					the teachers keep assigning her extra homework as punishment. She's very kind,
					especially to G.Z.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					E. S. talks so much it isn't funny. She's always touching your hair or fiddling
					with your buttons when she asks you something. They say she can't stand me, but
					I don't care, since I don't like her much either.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Henny Mets is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, except that she talks in
					a loud voice and is really childish when we're playing outdoors. Unfortunately,
					Henny has a girlfriend named Beppy who's a bad influence on her because she's
					dirty and vulgar.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					J.R. - I could write a whole book about her. J. is a detestable, sneaky,
					stuck-up, two-faced gossip who thinks she's so grown-up. She's really got
					Jacque under her spell, and that's a shame. J. is easily offended, bursts into
					tears at the slightest thing and, to top it all off, is a terrible show-off.
					Miss J. always has to be right. She's very rich, and has a closet full of the
					most adorable dresses that are way too old for her. She thinks she's gorgeous,
					but she's not. J. and I can't stand each other.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Use Wagner is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, but she's extremely
					finicky and can spend hours moaning and groaning about something. Ilse likes me
					a lot. She's very smart, but lazy.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Hanneli Goslar, or Lies as she's called at school, is a bit on the strange
					side. She's usually shy — outspoken at home, but reserved around other people.
					She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother. But she says what she thinks,
					and lately I've corne to appreciate her a great deal.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Nannie van Praag-Sigaar is small, funny and sensible. I think she's nice. She's
					pretty smart. There isn't much else you can say about Nannie. Eefje de Jong is,
					in my opinion, terrific. Though she's only twelve, she's quite the lady. She
					acts as if I were a baby. She's also very helpful, and I like her.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					G.Z. is the prettiest girl in our class. She has a nice face, but is kind of
					dumb. I think they're going to hold her back a year, but of course I haven't
					told her that.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 12 - COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE AT A LATER
				DATE
			-
				-
					To my areat surprise, G.Z. wasn't held back a year after all.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					And sitting next to G.Z. is the last of us twelve girls, me.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					There's a lot to be said about the boys, or maybe not so much after all.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					Maurice Coster is one of my many admirers, but pretty much of a pest. Sallie
					Springer has a filthy mind, and rumor has it that he's gone all the way. Still,
					I think he's terrific, because he's very funny.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					Emiel Bonewit is G.Z.'s admirer, but she doesn't care. He's pretty boring. Rob
					Cohen used to be in love with me too, but I can't stand him anymore. He's an
					obnoxious, two-faced, lying, sniveling little goof who has an awfully high
					opinion of himself.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					Max van de Velde is a farm boy from Medemblik, but eminently suitable, as
					Margot would say.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Herman Koopman also has a filthy mind, just like Jopie de Beer, who's a
					terrible flirt and absolutely girl-crazy.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					Leo Blom is Jopie de Beer's best friend, but has been ruined by his dirty mind.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					Albert de Mesquita came from the Montessori School and skipped a grade. He's
					really smart.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Leo Slager came from the same school, but isn't as smart.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					Ru Stoppelmon is a short, goofy boy from Almelo who transferred to this school
					in the middle of the year.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					C.N. does whatever he's not supposed to.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 24
			-
				-
					Jacques Kocernoot sits behind us, next to C., and we (G. and I) laugh ourselves
					silly. Harry Schaap is the most decent boy in our class. He's nice.
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 25
			-
				-
					Werner Joseph is nice too, but all the changes taking place lately have made
					him too quiet, so he seems boring. Sam Salomon is one of those tough guys from
					across the tracks. A real brat. (Admirer!)
				-
			-
				Entry 3 - MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942: Paragraph 26
			-
				-
					Appie Riem is pretty Orthodox, but a brat too.
				-

			Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942
		-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only
					because I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me
					that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a
					thirteen- year- old schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like
					writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my
					chest.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					"Paper has more patience than people." I thought of this saying on one of those
					days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin
					in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I
					finally stayed where I was, brooding. Yes, paper does have more patience, and
					since I'm not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook
					grandly referred to as a "diary," unless I should ever find a real friend, it
					probably won't make a bit of difference.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Now I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place:
					I don't have a friend.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen year-old
					girl is completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a
					sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends.
					I have a throng of admirers who can't keep their adoring eyes off me and who
					sometimes have to resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and catch a
					glimpse of me in the classroom. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home.
					No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I
					think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself
					to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able
					to get any closer, and that's the problem. Maybe it's my fault that we don't
					confide in each other. In any case, that's just how things are, and
					unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the diary.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't
					want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I
					want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend Kitty.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge
					right in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing
					so.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					My father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother
					until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister Margot was born in
					Frankfurt am
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Main in Germany in 1926. I was born on June 12, 1929. I lived in Frankfurt
					until I was four. Because we're Jewish, my father immigrated to Holland in
					1933, when he became the Managing Director of the Dutch Opekta Company, which
					manufactures products used in making jam. My mother, Edith Hollander Frank,
					went with him to Holland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen
					to stay with our grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I
					followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday
					present for Margot.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I started right away at the Montessori nursery school. I stayed there until I
					was six, at which time I started first grade. In sixth grade my teacher was
					Mrs. Kuperus, the principal. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we
					said a heartbreaking farewell, because I'd been accepted at the Jewish Lyceum,
					where Margot also went to school.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Our lives were not without anxiety, since our relatives in Germany were
					suffering under Hitler's anti-Jewish laws. After the pogroms in 1938 my two
					uncles (my mother's brothers) fled Germany, finding safe refuge in North
					America. My elderly grandmother came to live with us. She was seventy-three
					years old at the time.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					After May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first there was the
					war, then the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, which is when
					the trouble started for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a
					series of anti-Jewish decrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star: Jews
					were required to turn in their bicycles! Jews were forbidden to use
					street-cars! Jews were forbidden to ride in cars, even their own! Jews were
					required to do their shopping between 3 and 5 P.M.! Jews were required to
					frequent only Jewish-owned barbershops and beauty parlors! Jews were forbidden
					to be out on the streets between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.! Jews were forbidden to
					attend theaters, movies or any other forms of entertainment; Jews were
					forbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fields or any other
					athletic fields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidden to take
					part in any athletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their
					gardens or those of their friends after 8 P.M.; Jews were forbidden to visit
					Christians in their homes; Jews were required to attend Jewish schools, etc.
					You couldn't do this and you couldn't do that, but life went on. Jacque always
					said to me, "I don't dare do anything anymore, 'cause I'm afraid it's not
					allowed."
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					In the summer of 1941 Grandma got sick and had to have an operation, so my
					birthday passed with little celebration. In the summer of 1940 we didn't do
					much for my birthday either, since the fighting had just ended in Holland.
					Grandma died in January 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still
					love her. This birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the
					others, and Grandma's candle was lit along with the rest.
				-
			-
				Entry 4 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					The four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of
					June 20, 1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary.

				Entry 5 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Dearest Kitty! Let me get started right away; it's nice and quiet now. Father
					and Mother are out and Margot has gone to play Ping-Pong with some other young
					people at her friend Trees's. I've been playing a lot of Ping-Pong myself
					lately. So much that five of us girls have formed a club. It's called "The
					Little Dipper Minus Two." A really silly name, but it's based on a mistake. We
					wanted to give our club a special name; and because there were five of us, we
					came up with the idea of the Little Dipper. We thought it consisted of five
					stars, but we turned out to be wrong. It has seven, like the Big Dipper, which
					explains the "Minus Two." Ilse Wagner has a Ping-Pong set, and the Wagners let
					us play in their big dining room whenever we want. Since we five Ping-Pong
					players like ice cream, especially in the summer, and since you get hot playing
					Ping-Pong, our games usually end with a visit to the nearest ice-cream parlor
					that allows Jews: either Oasis or Delphi. We've long since stopped hunting
					around for our purses or money — most of the time it's so busy in Oasis that we
					manage to find a few generous young men of our acquaintance or an admirer to
					offer us more ice cream than we could eat in a week.
				-
			-
				Entry 5 - SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					You're probably a little surprised to hear me talking about admirers at such a
					tender age. Unfortunately, or not, as the case may be, this vice seems to be
					rampant at our school. As soon as a boy asks if he can bicycle home with me and
					we get to talking, nine times out of ten I can be sure he'll become enamored on
					the spot and won't let me out of his sight for a second. His ardor eventually
					cools, especially since I ignore his passionate glances and pedal blithely on
					my way. If it gets so bad that they start rambling on about "asking Father's
					permission," I swerve slightly on my bike, my schoolbag falls, and the young
					man feels obliged to get off his bike and hand me the bag, by which time I've
					switched the conversation to another topic. These are the most innocent types.
					Of course, there are those who blow you kisses or try to take hold of your arm,
					but they're definitely knocking on the wrong door. I get off my bike and either
					refuse to make further use of their company or act as if I'm insulted and tell
					them in no uncertain terms to go on home without me. There you are. We've now
					laid the basis for our friendship. Until tomorrow.

				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Our entire class is quaking in its boots. The reason, of course, is the
					upcoming meeting in which the teachers decide who'll be promoted to the next
					grade and who'll be kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.Z. and I laugh
					ourselves sick at the two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques Kocernoot, who have
					staked their entire vacation savings on their bet. From morning to night, it's
					"You're going to pass, No, I'm not," "Yes, you are," "No, I'm not." Even G.'s
					pleading glances and my angry outbursts can't calm them down. If you ask me,
					there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept
					back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth. Maybe this
					time they'll be unpredictable in the right direction for a change. I'm not so
					worried about my girlfriends and myself.
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					We'll make it. The only subject I'm not sure about is math. Anyway, all we can
					do is wait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men
					and two women. Mr. Keesing, the old fogey who teaches math, was mad at me for
					the longest time because I talked so much. After several warnings, he assigned
					me extra homework. An essay on the subject "A Chatterbox." A chatterbox, what
					can you write about that? I'd wbrry about that later, I decided. I jotted down
					the assignment in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					That evening, after I'd finished the rest of my homework, the note about the
					essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip
					of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the
					words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the
					necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I
					wrote the three pages Mr. Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued
					that talking is a female trait and that I would do my best to keep it under
					control, but that I would never be able to break myself of the habit, since my
					mother talked as much as I did, if not more, and that there's not much you can
					do about inherited traits.
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mr. Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my
					way through the next class, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was
					supposed to be on "An Incorrigible Chatterbox." I handed it in, and Mr. Keesing
					had nothing to complain about for two whole classes. However, during the third
					class he'd finally had enough. "Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class,
					write an essay entitled 'Quack, Quack, Quack,' said Mistress Chatterback.'"
				-
			-
				Entry 6 - SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The class roared. I had to laugh too, though I'd ) nearly exhausted my
					ingenuity on the topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with something
					else, j something original. My friend Sanne, who's good at poetry, offered to
					help me write the essay from beginning to end in verse. I jumped for joy.
					Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I'd
					make sure the joke was on him. I finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was
					about a mother duck and a father swan with three baby ducklings who were bitten
					to death by the father because they quacked too much. Luckily, Keesing took the
					joke the right way. He read the poem to the class, adding his own comments, and
					to several other classes as well. Since then I've been allowed to talk and
					haven't been assigned any extra homework. On the contrary, Keesing's always i
					making jokes these days.

					It's sweltering. Everyone is huffing and puffing, and in this heat I have to
					walk everywhere. Only now do I realize how pleasant a streetcar is, but we Jews
					are no longer allowed to make use of this luxury; our own two feet are good
					enough for us.

					Yesterday at lunchtime I had an appointment with the dentist on Jan
					Luykenstraat. It's a long way from our school on Stadstimmertuinen. That
					afternoon I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Fortunately, people automatically
					offer you something to drink. The dental assistant is really kind.

					I wish I didn't have to go to school. My bike was stolen during Easter

					Something unexpected happened yesterday morning. As I was passing the bicycle
					racks, I heard my name being called. I turned around and there was the nice boy
					I'd met the evening before at my friend Wilma's. He's Wilma's second cousin. I
					used to think Wilma was nice, which she is, but all she ever talks about is
					boys, and that gets to be a bore. He came toward me, somewhat shyly, and
					introduced himself as Hello Silberberg. I was a little surprised and wasn't
					sure what he wanted, but it didn't take me long to find out. He asked if I
					would allow him to accompany me to school. "As long as you're headed that way,
					I'll go with you," I said. And so we walked together. Hello is sixteen and good
					at telling all kinds of funny stories.

					Until today I honestly couldn't find the time to write you. I was with friends

			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Hello and I have gotten to know each other very well this past week, and he's
					told me a lot about his life. He comes from Gelsenkirchen and is living with
					his grandparents. His parents are in Belgium, but there's no way he can get
					there. Hello used to have a girlfriend named Ursula. I know her too. She's
					perfectly sweet and perfectly boring. Ever since he met me, Hello has realized
					that he's been falling asleep at Ursul's side. So I'm kind of a pep tonic. You
					never know what you're good for!

					Jacque spent Saturday night here. Sunday afternoon she was at Hanneli's, and I

			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Hello was supposed to come over that evening, but he called around six. I
					answered the phone, and he said, "This is Helmuth Silberberg. May I please
					speak to Anne?"
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 6

				-
					Oh, Hello. This is Anne.

				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 11

					I hung up, quickly changed my clothes and fixed my hair. I was so nervous I
					leaned out the window to watch for him. He finally showed up. Miracle of
					miracles, I didn't rush down the stairs, but waited quietly until he rang the
					bell. I went down to open the door, and he got right to the point.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					"Anne, my grandmother thinks you're too young for me to be seeing you on a
					regular basis. She says I should be going to the Lowenbachs', but you probably
					know that I'm not going out with Ursul anymore."
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					"No, I didn't know. What happened? Did you two have a fight?"
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					"No, nothing like that. I told Ursul that we weren't suited to each other and
					so it was
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					better for us not to go together anymore, but that she was welcome at my house
					and
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					I hoped I would be welcome at hers. Actually, I thought Ursul was hanging
					around with another boy, and I treated her as if she were. But that wasn't
					true. And then my uncle said I should apologize to her, but of course I didn't
					feel like it, and that's why I broke up with her. But that was just one of the
					reasons.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					"Now my grandmother wants me to see Ursul and not you, but I don't agree and
					I'm not going to. Sometimes old people have really old-fashioned ideas, but
					that doesn't mean I have to go along with them. I need my grandparents, but in
					a certain sense they need me too. From now on I'll be free on Wednesday
					evenings. You see, my grandparents made me sign up for a wood-carving class,
					but actually I go to a club organized by the Zionists. My grandparents don't
					want me to go, because they're anti-Zionists. I'm not a fanatic Zionist, but it
					interests me. Anyway, it's been such a mess lately that I'm planning to quit.
					So next Wednesday will be my last meeting. That means I can see you Wednesday
					evening, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon and maybe even
					more."
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					"But if your grandparents don't want you to, you? shouldn't go behind their

				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Just then we passed Blankevoort's Bookstore and there was Peter Schiff with two
					other boys! it was the first time he'd said hello to me in ages, and it really
					made me feel good.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					Monday evening Hello came over to meet Father and Mother. I had bought a cake
					and some candy, and we had tea and cookies, the works, but neither Hello nor I
					felt like sitting stiffly on our chairs. So we went out for a walk, and he
					didn't deliver me to my door until ten past eight. Father was furious. He said
					it was very wrong of me not to get home on time. I had to promise to be home by
					ten to eight in the future. I've been asked to Hello's on Saturday.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					Wilma told me that one night when Hello was at her house, she asked him, "Who
					do you like best, Ursul or Anne?"
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 24
			-
				-
					He said, "It's none of your business."
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 25
			-
				-
					But as he was leaving (they hadn't talked to each other the rest of the
					evening), he said, "Well, I like Anne better, but don't tell anyone. Bye!" And
					whoosh. . . he was out the door.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 26
			-
				-
					In everything he says or does, I can see that Hello is in love with me, and
					it's kind of nice for a change. Margot would say that Hello is eminently
					suitable. I think so too, but he's more than that. Mother is also full of
					praise: "A good-looking boy. Nice and polite." I'm glad he's so popular with
					everyone. Except with my girlfriends. He thinks they're very childish, and he's
					right about that. Jacque still teases me about him, but I'm not in love with
					him. Not really. It's all right for me to have boys as friends. Nobody minds.
				-
			-
				Entry 8 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942: Paragraph 27
			-
				-
					Mother is always asking me who I'm going to marry when I grow up, but I bet
					she'll never guess it's Peter, because I talked her out of that idea myself,
					without batting an eyelash. I love Peter as I've never loved anyone, and I tell
					myself he's only going around with all those other girls to hide his feelings
					for me. Maybe he thinks Hello and I are in love with each other, which we're
					not. He's just a friend, or as Mother puts it, a beau.

					Dear Kitty,

			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					The graduation ceremony in the Jewish Theater on Friday went as expected. My
					report card wasn't too bad. I got one D, a C— in algebra and all the rest B's,
					except for two B + 's and two B-'s. My parents are pleased, but they're not
					like other parents when it comes to grades. They never worry about report
					cards, good or bad. As long as I'm healthy and happy and don't talk back too
					much, they're satisfied. If these three things are all right, everything else
					will take care of itself.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I'm just the opposite. I don't want to be a poor student. I was accepted to the
					Jewish Lyceum on a conditional basis. I was supposed to stay in the seventh
					grade at the Montessori School, but when Jewish children were required to go to
					Jewish schools, Mr. Elte finally agreed, after a great deal of persuasion, to
					accept Lies Goslar and me. Lies also passed this year, though she has to repeat
					her geometry exam.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Poor Lies. It isn't easy for her to study at home; her baby sister, a spoiled
					little two-year-old, plays in her room all day. If Gabi doesn't get her way,
					she starts screaming, and if Lies doesn't look after her, Mrs. Goslar starts
					screaming. So Lies has a hard time doing her homework, and as long as that's
					the case, the tutoring she's been getting won't help much. The Goslar household
					is really a sight. Mrs. Goslar's parents live next door, but eat with the
					family. The there's a hired girl, the baby, the always absentminded and absent
					Mr. Goslar and the always nervous and irrita Ie Mrs. Goslar, who's expecting
					another baby. Lies, who's all thumbs, gets lost in the mayhem.

					My sister Margot has also gotten her report card.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Brilliant, as usual. If we had such a thing as "cum laude," she would have
					passed with honors, she's so smart.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Father has been home a lot lately. There's nothing for him to do at the office;
					it must be awful to feel you're not needed. Mr. Kleiman has taken over Opekta,
					and Mr. Kugler, Gies & Co., the company dealing in spices and spice substitutes
					that was set up in 1941.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					A few days ago, as we were taking a stroll around our neighborhood square,
					Father began to talk about going into hiding. He said it would be very hard for
					us to live cut off from the rest of the world. I asked him why he was bringing
					this up now.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"Well, Anne," he replied, "you know that for more than a year we've been
					bringing clothes, food and furniture to other people. We don't want our
					belongings to be seized by the Germans. Nor do we want to fall into their
					clutches ourselves. So we'll leave of our own accord and not wait to be hauled
					away."
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					"But when, Father?" He sounded so serious that I felt scared.
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					"Don't you worry. We'll take care of everything, just enjoy your carefree life
					while you can."
				-
			-
				Entry 9 - SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942: Paragraph 12

					That was it. Oh, may these somber words not come true for as long as possible.

					The doorbell's ringing, Hello's here, time to stop.

				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					It seems like years since Sunday morning. So much has happened it's as if the
					whole world had suddenly turned upside down. But as you can see, Kitty, I'm
					still alive, and that's the main thing, Father says. I'm alive all right, but
					don't ask where or how. You probably don't understand a word I'm saying today,
					so I'll begin by telling you what happened Sunday afternoon.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					At three o'clock (Hello had left but was supposed to come back later), the
					doorbell rang. I didn't hear it, since I was out on the balcony, lazily reading
					in the sun. A little while later Margot appeared in the kitchen doorway looking
					very agitated. "Father has received a call-up notice from the SS," she
					whispered. "Mother has gone to see Mr. van Daan" (Mr. van Daan is Father's
					business partner and a good friend.)
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I was stunned. A call-up: everyone knows what that means. Visions of
					concentration camps and lonely cells raced through my head. How could we let
					Father go to such a fate? "Of course he's not going," declared Margot as we
					waited for Mother in the living room. "Mother's gone to Mr. van Daan to ask
					whether we can move to our hiding place tomorrow. The van Daans are going with
					us. There will be seven of us altogether." Silence. We couldn't speak. The
					thought of Father off visiting someone in the Jewish Hospital and completely
					unaware of what was happening, the long wait for Mother, the heat, the suspense
					— all this reduced us to silence.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Suddenly the doorbell rang again. "That's Hello," I said.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Don't open the door!" exclaimed Margot to stop me. But it wasn't necessary,
					since we heard Mother and Mr. van Daan downstairs talking to Hello, and then
					the two of them came inside and shut the door behind them. Every time the bell
					rang, either Margot or I had to tiptoe downstairs to see if it was Father, and
					we didn't let anyone else in. Margot and I were sent from the room, as Mr. van
					Daan wanted to talk to Mother alone.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					When she and I were sitting in our bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was
					not for Father, but for her. At this second shock, I began to cry. Margot is
					sixteen — apparently they want to send girls her age away on their own. But
					thank goodness she won't be going; Mother had said so herself, which must be
					what Father had meant when he talked to me about our going into hiding. Hiding.
					. . where would we hide? In the city? In the country? In a house? In a shack?
					When, where, how. . . ? These were questions I wasn't allowed to ask, but they
					still kept running through my mind.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Margot and I started packing our most important belongings into a schoolbag.
					The first thing I stuck in was this diary, and then curlers, handkerchiefs,
					schoolbooks, a comb and some old letters. Preoccupied by the thought of going
					into hiding, I stuck the craziest things in the bag, but I'm not sorry.
					Memories mean more to me than dresses.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Father finally came hQme around five o'clock, and we called Mr. Kleiman to ask
					if he could come by that evening. Mr. van Daan left and went to get Miep. Miep
					arrived and promised to return later that night, taking with her a bag full of
					shoes, dresses, jackets, underwear and stockings. After that it was quiet in
					our apartment; none of us felt like eating. It was still hot, and everything
					was very strange.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					We had rented our big upstairs room to a Mr. Goldschmidt, a divorced man in his
					thirties, who apparently had nothing to do that evening, since despite all our
					polite hints he hung around until ten o'clock.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Miep and Jan Gies came at eleven. Miep, who's worked for Father's company since
					1933, has become a close friend, and so has her husband Jan. Once again, shoes,
					stockings, books and underwear disappeared into Miep's bag and Jan's deep
					pockets. At eleven-thirty they too disappeared.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					I was exhausted, and even though I knew it'd be my last night in my own bed, I
					fell asleep right away and didn't wake up until Mother called me at five-thirty
					the next morning. Fortunately, it wasn't as hot as Sunday; a warm rain fell
					throughout the day.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					The four of us were wrapped in so many layers of clothes it looked as if we
					were going off to spend the night in a refrigerator, and all that just so we
					could take more clothes with us. No Jew in our situation would dare leave the
					house with a suitcase full of clothes. I was wearing two undershirts, three
					pairs of underpants, a dress, and over that a skirt, a jacket, a raincoat, two
					pairs of stockings, heavy shoes, a cap, a scarf and lots more. I was
					suffocating even before we left the house, but no one bothered to ask me how I
					felt.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Margot stuffed her schoolbag with schoolbooks, went to get her bicycle and,
					with Miep leading the way, rode off into the great unknown. At any rate, that's
					how I thought of it, since I still didn't know where our hiding place was.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					At seven-thirty we too closed the door behind us; Moortje, my cat, was the only
					living creature I said good-bye to. According to a note we left for Mr.
					Goldschmidt, she was to be taken to the neighbors, who would give her a good
					home.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					The stripped beds, the breakfast things on the table, the pound of meat for the
					cat in the kitchen — all of these created the impression that we'd left in a
					hurry. But we weren't interested in impressions. We just wanted to get out of
					there, to get away and reach our destination in safety. Nothing else mattered.
				-
			-
				Entry 10 - WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942: Paragraph 17

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					So there we were, Father, Mother and I, walking in the pouring rain, each of us
					with a schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied
					assortment of items. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave us
					sympathetic looks; you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they
					couldn't offer us some kind of transportation; the conspicuous yellow star
					spoke for itself.
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Only when we were walking down the street did Father and Mother reveal, little
					by little, what the plan was. For months we'd been moving as much of our
					furniture and apparel out of the apartment as we could. It was agreed that we'd
					go into hiding on July 16. Because of Margot's call-up notice, the plan had to
					be moved up ten days, which meant we'd have to make do with less orderly rooms.
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The hiding place was located in Father's office building. That's a little hard
					for outsiders to understand, so I'll explain. Father didn't have a lot of
					people working in his office, just Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman, Miep and a twenty—
					three— year— old typist named Bep Voskuijl, all of whom were informed of our
					coming. Mr. Voskuijl, Bep's father, works in the warehouse, along with two
					assistants, none of whom were told anything.
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Here's a description of the building. The large warehouse on the ground floor
					is used as a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several different
					sections, such as the stockroom and the milling room, where cinnamon, cloves
					and a pepper substitute are ground.
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Next to the warehouse doors is another outside' door, a separate entrance to
					the office. Just inside the office door is a second door, and beyond that a
					stairway. At the top of the stairs is another door, with a frosted window on
					which the word "Office" is written in black letters. This is the big front
					office — very large, very light and very full. Bep, Miep and Mr. Kleiman work
					there during the day. After passing through an alcove containing a safe, a
					wardrobe and a big supply cupboard, you come to the small, dark, stuffy back
					office. This used to be shared by Mr. Kugler and Mr. van Daan, but now Mr.
					Kugler is its only occupant. Mr. Kugler's office can also be reached from the
					hallway, but only through a glass door that can be opened from the inside but
					not easily from the outside. If you leave Mr. Kugler's office and proceed
					through the long, narrow hallway past the coal bin and go up four steps, you
					find yourself in the private office, the showpiece of the entire building.
					Elegant mahogany furniture, a linoleum floor covered with throw rugs, a radio,
					a fancy lamp, everything first class. Next door is a spacious kitchen with a
					hot-water heater and two gas burners, and beside that a bathroom. That's the
					second floor.
				-
			-
				Entry 11 - THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-

					A wooden staircase leads from the downstairs hallway to the third floor. At the

					The door to the right of the landing leads to the "Secret Annex" at the back

					plain gray door. There's just one small step in front of the door, and then

					young ladies of the family, ro the right of the stairs is a windowless
					washroom, with a link. The door in the corner leads to the toilet and another
					one to Margot's and my room. If you go up the itairs and open the door at the
					top, you're surprised to see such a large, light and spacious room in an old
					canalside house like this. It contains a stove (thanks to the fact hat it used
					to be Mr. Kugler's laboratory) and a sink.

					Dearest Kitty, I've probably bored you with my long description of our house,
					but I still think you should know where I've ended up! how I ended up here is
					something you'll figure out from my next letters.
				-
			-
				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					But first, let me continue my story, because, as you know, I wasn't finished.
					After we arrived at 263 Prinsengracht, Miep quickly led us through the long
					hallway and up the wooden staircase to the next floor and into the Annex. She
					shut the door behind us, leaving us alone. Margot had arrived much earlier on
					her bike and was waiting for us.

				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 3

					Our living room and all the other rooms were so full of stuff that I can't find
					the

			-
				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 4

				-
					words to describe it. All the cardboard boxes that had been sent to the office
					in the last few months were piled on the floors and beds. The small room was
					filled from floor to cethng with linens. If we wanted to sleep in properly made
					beds that night,
				-
			-
				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					we had to get going and straighten up the mess. Mother and Margot were unable
					to move a muscle. They lay down on their bare mattresses, tired, miserable and
					I don't know what else. But Father and I, the two cleaner- uppers in the
					family, started in right away.
				-
			-
				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					All day long we unpacked boxes, filled cupboards, hammered nails and
					straightened up the mess, until we fell exhausted into our clean beds at night.
					We hadn't eaten a hot meal all day, but we didn't care! Mother and Margot were
					too tired and keyed up to eat, and Father and I were too busy.
				-
			-
				Entry 12 - FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Tuesday morning we started where we left off the night before. Bep and Miep
					went grocery shopping with our ration coupons, Father worked on our blackout
					screens, we scrubbed the kitchen floor, and were once again busy from sunup to
					sundown. Until Wednesday, I didn't have a chance to think about the enormous
					change in my life. Then for the first time since our arrival in the Secret
					Annex, I found a moment to tell you all about it and to realize what had
					happened to me and what was yet to happen.

				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Father, Mother and Margot still can't get used to the chiming of the
					Westertoren clock, which tells us the time every quarter of an hour. Not me, I
					liked it from the start; it sounds so reassuring, especially at night. You no
					doubt want to hear what I think of being in hiding. Well, all I can say is that
					I don't really know yet. I don't think I'll ever feel at home in this house,
					but that doesn't mean I hate it. It's more like being on vacation in some
					strange pension. Kind of an odd way to look at life in hiding, but that's how
					things are. The Annex is an ideal place to hide in. It may be damp and
					lopsided, but there's probably not a more comfortable hiding place in all of
					Amsterdam. No, in all of Holland.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Up to now our bedroom, with its blank walls, was very bare. Thanks to Father —
					who brought my entire postcard and movie-star collection here beforehand — and
					to a brush and a pot of glue, I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. It
					looks much more cheerful. When the van Daans arrive, we'll be able to build
					cupboards and other odds and ends out of the wood piled in the attic.

				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Margot and Mother have recovered somewhat. Yesterday Mother felt well enough to
					cook split-pea soup for the first time, but then she was downstairstalking and
					forgot all about it. The beans were scorched black, and no amount of scraping
					could get them out of the pan.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Last night the four of us went down to the private office and listened to
					England on the radio. I was so scared someone might hear it that I literally
					begged Father to take me back upstairs. Mother understood my anxiety and went
					with me. Whatever we do, we're very afraid the neighbors might hear or see us.
					We started off immediately the first day sewing curtains. Actually, you can
					hardly call them that, since they're nothing but scraps of fabric, varying
					greatly in shape, quality and pattern, which Father and I stitched crookedly
					together with unskilled fingers. These works of art were tacked to the windows,
					where they'll stay until we come out of hiding.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The building on our right is a branch of the Keg Company, a firm from Zaandam,
					and on the left is a furniture workshop. Though the people who work there are
					not on the premises after hours, any sound we make might travel through the
					walls. We've forbidden Margot to cough at night, even though she has a bad
					cold, and are giving her large doses of codeine.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I'm looking forward to the arrival of the van Daans, which is set for Tuesday.
					It will be much more fun and also not as quiet. You see, it's the silence that
					makes me so nervous during the evenings and nights, and I'd give anything to
					have one of our helpers sleep here.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					It's really not that bad here, since we can do our own cooking and can listen
					to the radio in Daddy's office.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Mr. Kleiman and Miep, and Bep Voskuijl too, have helped us so much. We've
					already canned loads of rhubarb, strawberries and cherries, so for the time
					being I doubt we'll be bored. We also have a supply of reading material, and
					we're going to buy lots of games. Of course, we can't ever look out the window
					or go outside. And we have to be quiet so the people downstairs can't hear us.
				-
			-
				Entry 13 - SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1942: Paragraph 10

					Yesterday we had our hands full. We had to pit two crates of cherries for Mr.

			-
				-
					They've all been so nice to me this last month because of my birthday, and yet
					every day I feel myself drifting further away from Mother and Margot. I worked
					hard today and they praised me, only to start picking on me again five minutes
					later.
				-
			-
				Entry 14 - SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					You can easily see the difference between the way they deal with Margot and the
					way they deal with me. For example, Margot broke the vacuum cleaner, and
					because of that we've been without light for the rest of the day. Mother said,
					"Well, Margot, it's easy to see you're not used to working; otherwise, you'd
					have known better than to yank the plug out by the cord." Margot made some
					reply, and that was the end of the story.
				-
			-
				Entry 14 - SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					But this afternoon, when I wanted to rewrite something on Mother's shopping
					list because her handwriting is so hard to read, she wouldn't let me. She
					bawled me out again, and the whole family wound up getting involved.
				-
			-
				Entry 14 - SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I don't fit in with them, and I've felt that clearly in the last few weeks.
					They're so sentimental together, but I'd rather be sentimental on my own.
					They're always saying how nice it is with the four of us, and that we get along
					so well, without giving a moment's thought to the fact that I don't feel that
					way.
				-
			-
				Entry 14 - SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Daddy's the only one who understands me, now and again, though he usually sides
					with Mother and Margot. Another thing I can't stand is having them talk about
					me in front of outsiders, telling them how I cried or how sensibly I'm
					behaving. It's horrible. And sometimes they talk about Moortje and I can't take
					that at all. Moortje is my weak spot. I miss her every minute of the day, and
					no one knows how often I think of her; whenever I do, my eyes fill with tears.
					Moortje is so sweet, and I love her so much that I keep dreaming she'll come
					back to us.
				-
			-
				Entry 14 - SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I have plenty of dreams, but the reality is that we'll have to stay here until
					the war is over. We can't ever go outside, and the only visitors we can have
					are Miep, her husband Jan, Bep Voskuijl, Mr. Voskuijl, Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman
					and Mrs. Kleiman, though she hasn't come because she thinks it's too dangerous.

				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I've deserted you for an entire month, but so little has happened that I can't
					find a newsworthy item to relate every single day. The van Daans arrived on
					July 13. We thought they were coming on the fourteenth, but from the thirteenth
					to sixteenth the Germans were sending out call-up notices right and left and
					causing a lot of unrest, so they decided it would be safer to leave a day too
					early than a day too late.
				-
			-
				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Peter van Daan arrived at nine-thirty in the morning (while we were still at
					breakfast). Peter's going on sixteen, a shy, awkward boy whose company won't
					amount to much. Mr. and Mrs. van Daan came half an hour later.
				-
			-
				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Much to our amusement, Mrs. van Daan was carrying a hatbox with a large chamber
					pot inside. "I just don't feel at home without my chamber pot," she exclaimed,
					and it was the first item to find a permanent place under the divan. Instead of
					a chamber pot, Mr. van D. was lugging a collapsible tea table under his arm.
				-
			-
				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					From the first, we ate our meals together, and after three days it felt as if
					the seven of us had become one big family. Naturally, the van Daans had much to
					tell about the week we'd been away from civilization. We were especially
					interested in what had happened to our apartment and to Mr. Goldschmidt.
				-
			-
				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan filled us in: "Monday morning at nine, Mr. Goldschmidt phoned and
					asked if I could come over. I went straightaway and found a very distraught Mr.
					Goldschmidt. He showed me a note that the Frank family had left behind. As
					instructed, he was planning to bring the cat to the neighbors, which I agreed
					was a good idea. He was afraid the house was going to be searched, so we w=nt
					through all the rooms, straightening up here and there and clearing the
					breakfast things off the table. Suddenly I saw a notepad on Mrs. Frank's desk,
					with an address in Maastricht written on it. Even though I knew Mrs. Frank had
					left it on purpose, I pretended to be surprised and horrified and begged Mr.
					Goldschmidt to burn this incriminating piece of paper. I swore up and down that
					I knew nothing about your disappearance, but that the note had given me an
					idea. 'Mr. Goldschmidt,' I said, 'I bet I know what this address refers to.
					About six months ago a high-ranking officer came to the office. It seems he and
					Mr. Frank grew up together. He promised to help Mr. Frank if it was ever
					necessary. As I recall, he was stationed in Maastricht. I think this officer
					has kept his word and is somehow planning to help them cross over to Belgium
					and then to Switzerland. There's no harm in telling this to any friends of the
					Franks who come asking about them. Of course, you don't need to mention the
					part about Maastricht.' And after that I left. This is the story most of your
					friends have been told, because I heard it later from several other people."
				-
			-
				Entry 15 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					We thought it was extremely funny, but we laughed even harder when Mr. van Daan
					told us that certain people have vivid imaginations. For example, one family
					living on our square claimed they sawall four of us riding by on our bikes
					early in the morning, and another woman was absolutely positive we'd been
					loaded into some kind of military vehicle in the middle of the night.

			-
				Entry 16 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Because so many houses are being searched for hidden bicycles, Mr. Kugler
					thought it would be better to have a bookcase built in front of the entrance to
					our hiding place. It swings out on its hinges and opens like a door. Mr.
					Voskuijl did the carpentry work. (Mr. Voskuijl has been told that the seven of
					us are in hiding, and he's been most helpful.)
				-
			-
				Entry 16 - FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Now whenever we want to go downstairs we have to duck and then jump. After the

					banging our heads against the low doorway. Then Peter cushioned it by nailing a
					towel stuffed with wood shavings to the doorframe. Let's see if it helps!

					There's little change in our lives here. Peter's hair was washed today, but
					that's nothing special. Mr. van Daan and I are always at loggerheads with each
					other. Mama always treats me like a baby, which I can't stand. For the rest,
					things are going better. I don't think Peter's gotten any nicer. He's an
					obnoxious boy who lies around on his bed all day, only rousing himself to do a

				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mr. and Mrs. van Daan have had a terrible fight. I've never seen anything like
					it, since Mother and Father wouldn't dream of shouting at each other like that.
					The argument was based on something so trivial it didn't seem worth wasting a
					single word on it. Oh well, to each his own.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Of course, it's very difficult for Peter, who gets caught in the middle, but no
					one takes Peter seriously anymore, since he's hypersensitive and lazy.
					Yesterday he was beside himself with worry because his tongue was blue instead
					of pink. This rare phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it came. Today he's
					walking around with a heavy scarf on because he's got a stiff neck. His
					Highness has been complaining of lumbago too. Aches and pains in his heart,
					kidneys and lungs are also par for the course. He's an absolute hypochondriac!
					(That's the right word, isn't it?)
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mother and Mrs. van Daan aren't getting along very well. There are enough
					reasons for the friction. To give you one small example, Mrs. van D. has
					removed all but three of her sheets from our communal linen closet. She's
					assuming that Mother's can be used for both families. She'll be in for a nasty
					surprise when she discovers that Mother has followed her lead.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Furthermore, Mrs. van D. is ticked off because we're using her china instead of
					ours. She's still trying to find out what we've done with our plates! they're a
					lot closer than she thinks, since they're packed in cardboard boxes in the
					attic, behind a load of Opekta advertising material. As long as we're in
					hiding, the plates will remain out of her reach. Since I'm always having
					accidents, it's just as well! Yesterday I broke one of Mrs. van D.'s soup
					bowls.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 6

				-
					"Oh!" she angrily exclaimed. "Can't you be more careful? That was my last one."
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Please bear in mind, Kitty, that the two ladies speak abominable Dutch (I don't
					dare comment on the gentlemen: they'd be highly insulted). If you were to hear
					their bungled attempts, you'd laugh your head off. We've given up pointing out
					their errors, since correcting them doesn't help anyway. Whenever I quote
					Mother or Mrs. van Daan, I'll write proper Dutch instead of trying to duplicate
					their speech.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Last week there was a brief interruption in our monotonous routine. This was
					provided by Peter — and a book about women. I should explain that Margot and
					Peter are allowed to read nearly all the books Mr. Kleiman lends us. But the
					adults preferred to keep this special book to themselves. This immediately
					piqued Peter's curiosity. What forbidden fruit did it contain? He snuck off
					with it when his mother was downstairs talking, and took himself and his booty
					to the loft. For two days all was well. Mrs. van Daan knew what he was up to,
					but kept mum until Mr. van Daan found out about it. He threw a fit, took the
					book away and assumed that would be the end of the business. However, he'd
					neglected to take his son's curiosity into account. Peter, not in the least
					fazed by his father's swift action, began thinking up ways to read the rest of
					this vastly interesting book.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					In the meantime, Mrs. van D. asked Mother for her opinion. Mother didn't think
					this particular book was suitable for Margot, but she saw no harm in letting
					her read most other books.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					You see, Mrs. van Daan, Mother Said, there's a big difference between Margot
					and Peter. To begin with, Margot's a girl, and girls are always more mature
					than boys. Second, she's already read many serious books and doesn't go looking
					for those which are no longer forbidden. Third, Margot's much more sensible and
					intellectually advanced, as a result of her four years at an excellent school."
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan agreed with her, but felt it was wrong as a matter of principle
					to let youngsters read books written for adults.
				-
			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Meanwhile, Peter had thought of a suitable time when no one would be interested
					in either him or the book. At seven— thirty in the evening, when the entire
					family was listening to the radio in the private office, he took his treasure
					and stole off to the loft again. He should have been back by eight-thirty, but
					he was so engrossed in the book that he forgot the time and was just coming
					down the stairs when his father entered the room. The scene that followed was
					not surprising: after a slap, a whack and a tug-of-war, the book lay on the
					table and Peter was in the loft.

					upstairs. No one gave him a moment's thought; he'd have to go to bed without
					his dinner. We continued eating, chatting merrily away, when suddenly we heard
					a piercing whistle. We lay down our forks and stared at each other, the shock
					clearly visible on our pale faces.

				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 16

					Mr. van Daan leapt up, his napkin falling to the floor, and shouted, with the

				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 17

					Father, afraid of what might happen, grabbed him by the arm and the two men

				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 19

					We protested that going without dinner was enough punishment. What if Peter

			-
				Entry 17 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942: Paragraph 20
			-

					Peter didn't apologize, and returned to the loft.

			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan decided to leave well enough alone, though he did note the next
					morning that Peter's bed had been slept in. At seven Peter went to the attic
					again, but was persuaded to come downstairs when Father spoke a few friendly
					words to him. After three days of sullen looks and stubborn silence, everything
					was back to normal.

			-
				-
					Today I'll tell you the general news here in the Annex. A lamp has been mounted
					above my divan bed so that in the future, when I hear the guns going off, I'll
					be able to pull a cord and switch on the light. I can't use it at the moment
					because we're keeping our window open a little, day and night.

			-
				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The male members of the van Daan contingent have built a very handy
					wood-stained food safe, with real screens. Up to now this glorious cupboard has
					been located in Peter's room, but in the interests of fresh air it's been moved
					to the attic. Where it once stood, there's now a shelf. I advised Peter to put
					his table underneath the shelf, add a nice rug and hang his own cupboard where
					the table now stands. That might make his little cubbyhole more comfy, though I
					certainly wouldn't like to sleep there.
				-
			-
				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan is unbearable. I'm continually being scolded for my incessant
					chatter when I'm upstairs. I simply let the words bounce right off me! Madame
					now has a new trick up her sleeve: trying to get out of washing the pots and
					pans. If there's a bit of food left at the bottom of the pan, she leaves it to
					spoil instead of transferring it to a glass dish. Then in the afternoon when
					Margot is stuck with cleaning all the pots and pans, Madame exclaims, "Oh, poor
					Margot, you have so much work to do!"

					Every other week Mr. Kleiman brings me a couple of books written for girls my

				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Father and I are currently working on our family tree, and he tells me
					something about each person as we go along. I've begun my schoolwork. I'm
					working hard at French, cramming five irregular verbs into my head every day.
					But I've forgotten much too much of what I learned in school.
				-
			-
				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Peter has taken up his English with great reluctance. A few schoolbooks have
					just arrived, and I brought a large supply of notebooks, pencils, erasers and
					labels from home. Pirn (that's our pet name for Father) wants me to help him
					with his Dutch lessons. I'm perfectly willing to tutor him in exchange for his

				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 8

				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					A few nights ago I was the topic of discussion, and we all decided I was an
					ignoramus. As a result, I threw myself into my schoolwork the next day, since I
					have little desire to still be a freshman when I'm fourteen or fifteen. The
					fact that I'm hardly allowed to read anything was also discussed. At the
					moment, Mother's reading Gentlemen, Wives and Servants, and of course I'm not
					allowed to read it (though Margot is!). First I have to be more intellectually
					developed, like my genius of a sister. Then we discussed my ignorance of
					philosophy, psychology and physiology (I immediately looked up these big words
					in the dictionary!). It's true, I don't know anything about these subjects. But
					maybe I'll be smarter next year!

				Entry 18 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I've come to the shocking conclusion that I have only one long-sleeved dress
					and three cardigans to wear in the winter. Father's given me permission to knit
					a white wool sweater: the yarn isn't very pretty, but it'll be warm, and that's
					what counts. Some of our clothing was left with friends, but unfortunately we
					won't be able to get to it until after the war. Provided it's still there, of
					course.

			-
				Entry 19 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Father has a friend, a man in his mid— seventies named Mr. Dreher, who's sick,
					poor and deaf as a post. At his side, like a useless appendage, is his wife,
					twenty- seven years younger and equally poor, whose arms and legs are loaded
					with real and fake bracelets and rings left over from more prosperous days.
					This Mr. Dreher has already been a great nuisance to Father, and I've always
					admired the saintly patience with which he handled this pathetic old man on the
					phone. When we were still living at home, Mother used to advise him to put a
					gramophone in front of the receiver, one that would repeat every three minutes,
					"Yes, Mr. Dreher" and "No, Mr. Dreher," since the old man never understood a
					word of Father's lengthy replies anyway.
				-
			-
				Entry 19 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Today Mr. Dreher phoned the office and asked Mr. Kugler to come and see him.
					Mr. Kugler wasn't in the mood and said he would send Miep, but Miep canceled
					the appointment. Mrs. Dreher called the office three times, but since Miep was
					reportedly out the entire afternoon, she had to imitate Bep's voice. Downstairs
					in the office as well as upstairs in the Annex, there was great hilarity. Now
					each time the phone rings, Bep says' 'That's Mrs. Dreher!" and Miep has to
					laugh, so that the people on the other end of the line are greeted with an
					impolite giggle. Can't you just picture it? This has got to be the greatest
					office in the whole wide world. The bosses and the office girls have such fun
					together!
				-
			-
				Entry 19 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Some evenings I go to the van Daans for a little chat. We eat "mothball
					cookies" (molasses cookies that were stored in a closet that was mothproofed)
					and have a good time. Recently the conversation was about Peter. I said that he
					often pats me on the cheek, which I don't like. They asked me in a typically
					grown-up way whether I could ever learn to love Peter like a brother, since he
					loves me like a sister. "Oh, no!" I said, but what I was thinking was, "Oh,
					ugh!" Just imagine! I added that Peter's a bit stiff, perhaps because he's shy.
					Boys who aren't used to being around girls are like that.
				-
			-
				Entry 19 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I must say that the Annex Committee (the men's section) is very creative.
					Listen to the scheme they've come up with to get a message to Mr. Broks, an
					Opekta Co. sales representative and friend who's surreptitiously hidden some of
					our things for us! They're going to type a letter to a store owner in southern
					Zealand who is, indirectly, one of Opekta' s customers and ask him to fill out
					a form and send it back in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Father will
					write the address on the envelope himself. Once the letter is returned from
					Zealand, the form can be removed and a handwritten message confirming that
					Father is alive can be inserted in the envelope. This way Mr. Broks can read
					the letter without suspecting a ruse. They chose the province of Zealand
					because it's close to Belgium (a letter can easily be smuggled across the
					border) and because no one is allowed to travel there without a special permit.
					An ordinary salesman like Mr. Broks would never be granted a permit.

				Entry 19 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1942: Paragraph 6

					Yesterday Father put on another act. Groggy with sleep, he stumbled off to bed.
					His feet were cold, so I lent him my bed socks. Five minutes later he flung
					them to the floor. Then he pulled the blankets over his head because the light
					bothered him. The lamp was switched off, and he gingerly poked his head out
					from under the covers. It was all very amusing. We started talking about the
					fact that Peter says Margot is a "buttinsky." Suddenly Daddy's voice was heard
					from the depths: "Sits on her butt, you mean.

			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mother and I had a so-called "discussion" today, but the annoying part is that
					I burst into tears. I can't help it. Daddy is always nice to me, and he also
					understands me much better. At moments like these I can't stand Mother. It's
					obvious that I'm a stranger to her; she doesn't even know what I think about
					the most ordinary things.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					We were talking about maids and the fact that you're supposed to refer to them
					as "domestic help" these days. She claimed that when the war is over, that's
					what they'll want to be called. I didn't quite see it that way. Then she added
					that I talk about' 'later" so often and that I act as if I were such a lady,
					even though I'm not, but I don't think building sand castles in the air is such
					a terrible thing to do, as long as you don't take it too seriously. At any
					rate, Daddy usually comes to my defense. Without him I wouldn't be able to
					stick it out here.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I don't get along with Margot very well either. Even though our family never
					has the same kind of outbursts they have upstairs, I find it far from pleasant.
					Margot's and Mother's personalities are so alien to me. I understand my
					girlfriends better than my own mother. Isn't that a shame?
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					For the umpteenth time, Mrs. van Daan is sulking. She's very moody and has been
					removing more and more of her belongings and locking them up. It's too bad
					Mother doesn't repay every van Daan "disappearing act" with a Frank
					"disappearing act."
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Some people, like the van Daans, seem to take special delight not only in
					raising their own children but in helping others raise theirs. Margot doesn't
					need it, since she's naturally good, kind and clever, perfection itself, but I
					seem to have enough mischief for the two of us. More than once the air has been
					filled with the van Daans' admonitions and my saucy replies. Father and Mother
					always defend me fiercely. Without them I wouldn't be able to jump back into
					the fray with my usual composure. They keep telling me I should talk less, mind
					my own business and be more modest, but I seem doomed to failure. If Father
					weren't so patient, I'd have long ago given up hope of ever meeting my parents'
					quite moderate expectations.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					If I take a small helping of a vegetable I loathe and eat potatoes instead, the
					van Daans, especially Mrs. van Daan, can't get over how spoiled I am. "Come on,
					Anne, eat some more vegetables," she says.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					"No, thank you, ma'am," I reply. "The potatoes are more than enough."
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"Vegetables are good for you; your mother says so too. Have some more," she
					insists, until Father intervenes and upholds my right to refuse a dish I don't
					like.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Then Mrs. van D. really flies off the handle: "You should have been at our
					house, where children were brought up the way they should be. I don't call this
					a proper upbringing. Anne is terribly spoiled. I'd never allow that. If Anne
					were my daughter. .
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					This is always how her tirades begin and end: "If Anne were my daughter. . ."
					Thank goodness I'm not.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					But to get back to the subject of raising children, yesterday a silence fell
					after Mrs. van D. finished her little speech. Father then replied, "I think
					Anne is very well brought up. At least she's learned not to respond to your
					interminable sermons. As far as the vegetables are concerned, all I have to say
					is look who's calling the kettle black."
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. was soundly defeated. The pot calling the ketde black refers of
					course to Madame herself, since she can't tolerate beans or any kind of cabbage
					in the evening because they give her "gas." But I could say the same. What a
					dope, don't you think? In any case, let's hope she stops talking about me.
				-
			-
				Entry 20 - SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1942: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					It's so funny to see how quickly Mrs. van Daan flushes. I don't, and it secredy
					annoys her no end.

					Dearest Kitty,

			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I had to stop yesterday, though I was nowhere near finished. I'm dying to tell
					you about another one of our clashes, but before I do I'd like to say this: I
					think it's odd that grown-ups quarrel so easily and so often and about such
					petty matters. Up to now I always thought bickering was just something children
					did and that they outgrew it. Often, of course, there's sometimes a reason to
					have a real quarrel, but the verbal exchanges that take place here are just
					plain bickering. I should be used to the fact that these squabbles are daily
					occurrences, but I'm not and never will be as long as I'm the subject of nearly
					every discussion. (They refer to these as "discussions" instead of "quarrels,"
					but Germans don't know the difference!) They criticize everything, and I mean
					everything, about me: my behavior, my personality, my manners; every inch of
					me, from head to toe and back again, is the subject of gossip and debate. Harsh
					words and shouts are constantly being flung at my head, though I'm absolutely
					not used to it. According to the powers that be, I'm supposed to grin and bear
					it. But I can't! I have no intention of taking their insults lying down. I'll
					show them that Anne Frank wasn't born yesterday. They'll sit up and take notice
					and keep their big mouths shut when I make them see they ought to attend to
					their own manners instead of mine. How dare they act that way! It's simply
					barbaric. I've been astonished, time and again, at such rudeness and most of
					all. . . at such stupidity (Mrs. van Daan). But as soon as I've gotten used to
					the idea, and that shouldn't take long, I'll give them a taste of their own
					medicine, and then they'll change their tune! Am I really as bad-mannered,
					headstrong, stubborn, pushy, stupid, lazy, etc., etc., as the van Daans say I
					am? No, of course not. I know I have my faults and shortcomings, but they blow
					them all out of proportion! If you only knew, Kitty, how I seethe when they
					scold and mock me. It won't take long before I explode with pent-up rage.
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					But enough of that. I've bored you long enough with my quarrels, and yet I
					can't resist adding a highly interesting dinner conversation.
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Somehow we landed on the subject of Pirn's extreme diffidence. His modesty is a
					well-known fact, which even the stupidest person wouldn't dream of questioning.
					All of a sudden Mrs. van Daan, who feels the need to bring herself into every
					conversation, remarked, "I'm very modest and retiring too, much more so than my
					husband!"
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? This sentence clearly illustrates
					that she's not exactly what you'd call modest!
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan, who felt obliged to explain the "much more so than my husband,"
					answered calmly, "I have no desire to be modest and retiring. In my experience,
					you get a lot further by being pushy!" And turning to me, he added, "Don't be
					modest and retiring, Anne. It will get you nowhere."
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Mother agreed completely with this viewpoint. But, as usual, Mrs. van Daan had
					to add her two cents. This time, however, instead of addressing me directly,
					she turned to my parents and said, "You must have a strange outlook on life to
					be able to say that to Anne. Things were different when I was growing up.
					Though they probably haven't changed much since then, except in your modern
					household!"
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					This was a direct hit at Mother's modern child-rearing methods, which she's
					defended on many occasions. Mrs. van Daan was so upset her face turned bright
					red. People who flush easily become even more agitated when they feel
					themselves getting hot under the collar, and they quickly lose to their
					opponents.
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					The nonflushed mother, who now wanted to have the matter over and done with as
					quickly as possible, paused for a moment to think before she replied. "Well,
					Mrs. van Daan, I agree that it's much better if a person isn't overmodest. My
					husband, Margot and Peter are all exceptionally modest. Your husband, Anne and
					I, though not exactly the opposite, don't let ourselves be pushed around."
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan: "Oh, but Mrs. Frank, I don't understand what you mean! Honestly,
					I'm extremely modest and retiring. How can you say that I'm pushy?"
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Mother: "I didn't say you were pushy, but no one would describe you as having a
					retiring disposition."
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D.: "I'd like to know in what way I'm pushy! If I didn't look out for
					myself here, no one else would, and I'd soon starve, but that doesn't mean I'm
					not as modest and retiring as your husband."
				-
			-
				Entry 21 - MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28,1942: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Mother had no choice but to laugh at this ridiculous self-defense, which
					irritated Mrs. van Daan. Not exactly a born debater, she continued her
					magnificent account in a mixture of German and Dutch, until she got so tangled
					up in her own words that she finally rose from her chair and was just about to
					leave the room when her eye fell on me. You should have seen her! As luck would
					have it, the moment Mrs. van D. turned around I was shaking my head in a
					combination of compassion and irony. I wasn't doing it on purpose, but I'd
					followed her tirade so intently that my reaction was completely involuntary.
					Mrs. van D. wheeled around and gave me a tongue-lashing: hard, Germanic, mean
					and vulgar, exactly like some fat, red-faced fishwife. It was a joy to behold.
					If I could draw, I'd like to have sketched her as she was then. She struck me
					as so comical, that silly little scatterbrain! I've learned one thing: you only
					really get to know a person after a fight. Only then can you judge their true
					character!

				-
					The strangest things happen to you when you're in hiding! Try to picture this.
					Because we don't have a bathtub, we wash ourselves in a washtub, and because
					there's only hot water in the office (by which I mean the entire lower floor),
					the seven of us take turns making the most of this great opportunity. But since
					none of us are alike and are all plagued by varying degrees of modesty, each
					member of the family has selected a different place to wash. Peter takes a bath
					in the office kitchen, even though it has a glass door. When it's time for his
					bath, he goes around to each of us in turn and announces that we shouldn't walk
					past the kitchen for the next half hour. He considers this measure to be
					sufficient. Mr. van D. takes his bath upstairs, figuring that the safety of his
					own room outweighs the difficulty of having to carry the hot water up all those
					stairs. Mrs. van D. has yet to take a bath; she's waiting to see which is the
					best place. Father bathes in the private office and Mother in the kitchen
					behind a fire screen, while Margot and I have declared the front office to be
					our bathing grounds. Since the curtains are drawn on Saturday afternoon, we
					scrub ourselves in the dark, while the one who isn't in the bath looks out the
					window through a chink in the curtains and gazes in wonder at the endlessly
					amusing people.

					A week ago I decided I didn't like this spot and have been on the lookout for
					more comfortable bathing quarters. It was Peter who gave me the idea of setting
					my washtub in the spacious office bathroom. I can sit down, turn on the light,
					lock the door, pour out the water without anyone's help, and all without the
					fear of being seen. I used my lovely bathroom for the first time on Sunday and,
					strange as it may seem, I like it better than any other place.

					The plumber was at work downstairs on Wednesday, moving the water pipes and
					drains from the office bathroom to the hallway so the pipes won't freeze during
					a cold winter. The plumber's visit was far from pleasant. Not only were we not
					allowed to run water during the day, but the bathroom was also off-limits. I'll
					tell you how we handled this problem; you may find it unseemly of me to bring
					it up, but I'm not so prudish about matters of this kind. On the day of our
					arrival, Father and I improvised a chamber pot, sacrificing a canning jar for
					this purpose. For the duration of the plumber's visit, canning jars were put
					into service during the daytime to hold our calls of nature. As far as I was
					concerned, this wasn't half as difficult as having to sit still all day and not
					say a word. You can imagine how hard that was for Miss Quack, Quack, Quack. On
					ordinary days we have to speak in a whisper; not being able to talk or move at
					all is ten times worse.

					The days here are very quiet. Mr. Levinsohn, a little Jewish pharmacist and

					entire building, we're in constant dread that he'll take it into his head to go
					have a look at what used to be the laboratory. We're as still as baby mice. Who

					Let me pause a moment on the subject of Mrs. van Daan and tell you that her

					pats him on the cheek and head, hikes up her skirt and makes so-called witty
					remarks in an effort to get's Pirn's attention. Fortunately, he finds her
					neither pretty nor charming, so he doesn't respond to her flirtations. As you
					know, I'm quite the jealous type, and I can't abide her behavior. After all,
					Mother doesn't act that way toward Mr. van D., which is what I told Mrs. van D.
					right to her face.

					Another reason I welcome the change is that Mama's always carping at me,
					especially at the table. Now Margot will have to bear the brunt of it. Or
					rather, won't, since Mother doesn't make such sarcastic remarks to her. Not to
					that paragon of virtue! I'm always teasing Margot about being a paragon of

					Yesterday Mother and I had another run-in and she really kicked up a fuss. She

					already had such an awful headache. I finally told Daddy that I love "him" more
					than I do Mother, to which he replied that it was just a passing phase, but I
					don't think so. I simply can't stand Mother, and I have to force myself not to
					snap at her all the time, and to stay calm, when I'd rather slap her across the
					face. I don't know why I've taken such a terrible dislike to her. Daddy says
					that if Mother isn't feeling well or has a headache, I should volunteer to help
					her, but I'm not going to because I don't love her and don't enjoy doing it. I
					can imagine Mother dying someday, but Daddy's death seems inconceivable. It's
					very mean of me, but that's how I feel. I hope Mother will never read this or
					anything else I've written.

					I've been allowed to read more grown-up books lately. Eva's Youth by Nico van
					Suchtelen is currently keeping me busy. I don't think there's much of a
					difference between this and books for teenage girls. Eva thought that children
					grew on trees, like apples, and that the stork plucked them off the tree when
					they were ripe and brought them to the mothers. But her girlfriend's cat had
					kittens and Eva saw them coming out of the cat, so she thought cats laid eggs
					and hatched them like chickens, and that mothers who wanted a child also went
					upstairs a few days before their time to lay an egg and brood on it. After the
					babies arrived, the mothers were pretty weak from all that squatting. At some
					point, Eva wanted a baby too. She took a wool scarf and spread it on the ground
					so the egg could fall into it, and then she squatted down and began to push.
					She clucked as she waited, but no egg came out. Finally, after she'd been
					sitting for a long time, something did come, but it was a sausage instead of an
					egg. Eva was embarrassed. She thought she was sick. Funny, isn't it? There are
					also parts of Eva's Youth that talk about women selling their bodies on the
					street and asking loads of money. I'd be mortified in front of a man like that.
					In addition, it mentions Eva's menstruation. Oh, I long to get my period — then
					I'll really be grown up. Daddy is grumbling again and threatening to take away
					my diary. Oh, horror of horrors! From now on, I'm going to hide it.

					Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish
					friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is
					treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork,
					the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us
					about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in
					Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water
					is available only one hour a day,
				-
			-
				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women
					sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved.
					Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by
					their shorn heads.
				-
			-
				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and
					uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of
					them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps
					that's the quickest way to die.
				-
			-
				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep
					is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an
					elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a
					car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns
					firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody
					would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.
				-
			-
				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time
					the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load
					on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or
					"One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is
					not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men
					depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small
					station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.
				-
			-
				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term
					"hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible
					thing you can imagine. Leading citizens — innocent people — are taken prisoner
					to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply
					grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the
					announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal
					accidents.'
				-

				Entry 26 - OCTOBER 9, 1942: Paragraph 8

					Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of

					besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.

					My hand's still shaking, though it's been two hours since we had the scare. I
					should explain that there are five fire extinguishers in the building. The

					be quiet until I heard the sound of hammering on the landing (across from the

					was eating lunch, that she couldn't go back downstairs. Father and I stationed
					ourselves at the door so we could hear when the man had left. After working for
					about fifteen minutes, he laid his hammer and some other tools on our bookcase
					(or so we thought!) and banged on our door. We turned white with fear. Had he
					heard something after all and now wanted to check out this mysterious-looking
					bookcase? It seemed so, since he kept knocking, pulling, pushing and jerking on
					it.

					I was so scared I nearly fainted at the thought of this total stranger managing
					to discover our wonderful hiding place. Just when I thought my days were
					numbered, we heard Mr. Kleiman's voice saying, "Open up, it's me." We opened
					the door at once. What had happened?
				-
			-
				Entry 28 - TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The hook fastening the bookcase had gotten stuck, which is why no one had been
					able to warn us about the carpenter. After the man had left, Mr. Kleiman came
					to get Bep, but couldn't open the bookcase. I can't tell you how relieved I
					was. In my imagination, the man I thought was trying to get inside the Secret
					Annex had kept growing and growing until he'd become not only a giant but also
					the cruelest Fascist in the world. Whew. Fortunately, everything worked out all
					right, at least this time.

				Entry 28 - TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					We had lots of fun on Monday. Miep and Jan spent the night with us. Margot and
					I slept in Father and Mother's room for the night so the Gieses could have our
					beds. The menu was drawn up in their honor, and the meal was delicious. The
					festivities were briefly interrupted when Father's lamp caused a short circuit
					and we were suddenly plunged into darkness. What were we to do? We did have
					fuses, but the fuse box was at the rear of the dark warehouse, which made this
					a particularly unpleasant job at night. Still, the men ventured forth, and ten
					minutes later we were able to put away the candles.

					I was up early this morning. Jan was already dressed. Since he had to leave at
					eight-thirty, he was upstairs eating breakfast by eight. Miep was busy getting
					dressed, and I found her in her undershirt when I came in. She wears the same
					kind of long underwear I do when she bicycles. Margot and I threw on our
					clothes as well and were upstairs earlier than usual. After a pleasant
					breakfast, Miep headed downstairs. It was pouring outside and she was glad she
					didn't have to bicycle to work. Daddy and I made the beds, and afterward I
					learned five irregular French verbs. Quite industrious, don't you think?

					Margot and Peter were reading in our room, with Mouschi curled up beside Margot

					almost finished.

					I'm very worried. Father's sick. He's covered with spots and has a high

					This morning Miep told us that the furniture has been removed from the van

					been so "nervenmassig"* [*nervous] lately, and we don't feel like hearing her
					moan and groan again about all the beautiful china and lovely chairs she had to

				Entry 29 - THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1942: Paragraph 4

				-
					Father wants me to start reading books by Hebbel and other well-known German

					taken the plays of Goethe and Schiller down from the big bookcase and is
					planning to read to me every evening. We've started off with Don Carlos.
					Encouraged by Father's good example, Mother pressed her prayer book into my
					hands. I read a few prayers in German, just to be polite. They certainly sound
					beautiful, but they mean very little to me. Why is she making me act so
					religious and devout?

					Now that I'm rereading my diary after a year and a half, I'm surprised at my

					about Margot, Mother and Father as if I'd written them only yesterday, but I
					can't imagine writina so openly about other matters. It embarrasses me greatly

			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mother's nerves are very much on edge, and that doesn't bode well for me. Is it
					just a coincidence that Father and Mother never scold Margot and always blame
					me for everything? Last night, for example, Margot was reading a book with
					beautiful illustrations; she got up and put the book aside for later. I wasn't
					doing anything, so I picked it up and began looking at the pictures. Margot
					carne back, saw' "her" book in my hands, knitted her brow and angrily demanded
					the book back. I wanted to look through it some more. Margot got madder by the
					minute, and Mother butted in: "Margot was reading that book; give it back to
					her."
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Father came in, and without even knowing what was going on, saw that Margot was
					being wronged and lashed out at me: "I'd like to see what you'd do if Margot
					was looking at one of your books!"
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I promptly gave in, put the book down and, according to them, left the room'
					'in a huff." I was neither huffy nor cross, but merely sad.
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					It wasn't right of Father to pass judgment without knowing what the issue was.
					I would have given the book to Margot myself, and a lot sooner, if Father and
					Mother hadn't intervened and rushed to take Margot's part, as if she were
					suffering some great injustice.
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Of course, Mother took Margot's side; they always take each other's sides. I'm
					so used to it that I've become completely indifferent to Mother's rebukes and
					Margot's moodiness. I love them, but only because they're Mother and Margot. I
					don't give a darn about them as people. As far as I'm concerned, they can go
					jump in a lake. It's different with Father. When I see him being partial to
					Margot, approving Margot's every action, praising her, hugging her, I feel a
					gnawing ache inside, because I'm crazy about him. I model myself after Father,
					and there's no one in the world I love more. He doesn't realize that he treats
					Margot differently than he does me: Margot just happens to be the smartest, the
					kindest, the prettiest and the best. But I have a right to be taken seriously
					too. I've always been the clown and mischief maker of the family; I've always
					had to pay double for my sins: once with scoldings and then again with my own
					sense of despair. I'm no longer satisfied with the meaningless affection or the
					supposedly serious talks. I long for something from Father that he's incapable
					of giving. I'm not jealous of Margot; I never have been. I'm not envious of her
					brains or her beauty. It's just that I'd like to feel that Father really loves
					me, not because I'm his child, but because I'm me, Anne.
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily and it's only
					through him that I'm able to retain the last ounce of family feeling I have
					left. He doesn't understand that I sometimes need to vent my feelings for
					Mother. He doesn't want to talk about it, and he avoids any discussion
					involving Mother's failings. And yet Mother, with all her shortcomings, is
					tougher for me to deal with. I don't know how I should act. I can't very well
					confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness, yet I
					can't continue to take the blame for everything.
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash. I don't mean to judge her; I
					don't have that right. I'm simply looking at her as a mother. She's not a
					mother to me — I have to mother myself. I've cut myself adrift from them. I'm
					charting my own course, and we'll see where it leads me. I have no choice,
					because I can picture what a mother and a wife should be and can't seem to find
					anything of the sort in the woman I'm supposed to call "Mother."
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I tell myself time and again to overlook Mother's bad example. I only want to
					see her good points, and to look inside myself for what's lacking in her. But
					it doesn't work, and the worst part is that Father and Mother don't realize
					their own inadequacies and how much I blame them for letting me down. Are there
					any parents who can make their children completely happy?
				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Sometimes I think God is trying to test me, both now and in the future. I'll

				-
			-
				Entry 32 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Who else but me is ever going to read these letters? Who else but me can I turn

					resolve to do better.

					goose who doesn't know a thing and yet imagines she's learned all she needs to
					know from books! I'm no longer the baby and spoiled little darling whose every
					deed can be laughed at. I have my own ideas, plans and ideals, but am unable to
					articulate them yet.

					Oh well. So much comes into my head at night when I'm alone, or during the day

					misinterpret my intentions. That's why I always wind up coming back to my diary
					— I start there and end there because Kitty's always patient. I promise her
					that, despite everything, I'll keep going, that I'll find my own way and choke
					back my tears. I only wish I could see some results or, just once, receive
					encouragement from someone who loves me.

					"This is the beginning of the end," everyone was saying, but Churchill, the

					Bread is delivered daily by a very nice baker, a friend of Mr. Kleiman's. Of

					purchase ration books on the black market. The price keeps going up; it's

			-
				Entry 33 - MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9,1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					To provide ourselves with a source of nutrition that will keep, aside from the
					hundred cans of food we've stored here, we bought three hundred pounds of
					beans. Not just for us, but for the office staff as well. We'd hung the sacks
					of beans on hooks in the hallway, just inside our secret entrance, but a few
					seams split under the weight. So we decided to move them to the attic, and
					Peter was entrusted with the heavy lifting. He managed to get five of the six
					sacks upstairs intact and was busy with the last one when the sack broke and a
					flood, or rather a hailstorm, of brown beans went flying through the air and
					down the stairs. Since there were about fifty pounds of beans in that sack, it
					made enough noise to raise the dead. Downstairs they were sure the house was
					falling down around their heads. Peter was stunned, but then burst into peals
					of laughter when he saw me standing at the bottom of the stairs, like an island
					in a sea of brown, with waves of beans lapping at my ankles. We promptly began
					picking them up, but beans are so small and slippery that they roll into every
					conceivable corner and hole. Now each time we go upstairs, we bend over and
					hunt around so we can present Mrs. van Daan with a handful of beans.

					Great news! We're planning to take an eighth person into hiding with us!
				-
			-
				Entry 34 - TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Yes, really. We always thought there was enough room and food for one more
					person, but we were afraid of placing an even greater burden on Mr. Kugler and
					Mr. Kleiman. But since reports of the dreadful things being done to the Jews
					are getting worse by the day, Father decided to sound out these two gentlemen,
					and they thought it was an excellent plan. "It's just as dangerous, whether
					there are seven or eight," they noted rightly. Once this was settled, we sat
					down and mentally went through our circle of acquaintances, trying to come up
					with a single person who would blend in well with our extended family. This
					wasn't difficult. After Father had rejected all the van Daan relatives, we
					chose a dentist named Alfred Dussel. He lives with a charming Christian lady
					who's quite a bit younger than he is. They're probably not married, but that's
					beside the point. He's known to be quiet and refined, and he seemed, from our
					superficial acquaintance with him, to be nice. Miep knows him as well, so
					she'll be able to make the necessary arrangements. If he comes, Mr. Dussel will
					have to sleep in my room instead of Margot, who will have to make do with the
					folding bed.* [After Dussel arrived, Margot slept in her parents' bedroom.]
					We'll ask him to bring along something to fill cavities with.

					Miep came to tell us that she'd been to see Dr. Dussel. He asked her the moment
					she entered the room if she knew of a hiding place and was enormously pleased
					when Miep said she had something in mind. She added "that he'd need to go into
					hiding as soon as possible, preferably Saturday, but he thought this was highly
					improbable, since he wanted to bring his records up to date, settle his
					accounts and attend to a couple of patients. Miep relayed the message to us
					this morning. We didn't think it was wise to wait so long. All these
					preparations require explanations to various people who we feel ought to be
					kept in the dark. Miep went to ask if Dr. Dussel couldn't manage to come on
					Saturday after all, but he said no, and now he's scheduled to arrive on Monday.

					I think it's odd that he doesn't jump at our proposal. If they pick him up on

					Mr. Dussel has arrived. Everything went smoothly. Miep told him to be at a
					certain place in front of the post office at 11 A.M., when a man would meet
					him, and he was at the appointed place at the appointed time. Mr. Kleiman went
					up to him, announced that the man he was expecting to meet was unable to come
					and asked him to drop by the office to see Miep. Mr. Kleiman took a streetcar
					back to the office while Mr. Dussel followed on foot.
				-
			-
				Entry 36 - TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					It was eleven-twenty when Mr. Dussel tapped on the office door. Miep asked him
					to remove his coat, so the yellow star couldn't be seen, and brought him to the
					private office, where Mr. Kleiman kept him occupied until the cleaning lady had
					gone. On the pretext that the private office was needed for something else,
					Miep took Mr. Dussel upstairs, opened the bookcase and stepped inside, while
					Mr. Dussellooked on in amazement.

				Entry 36 - TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1942: Paragraph 4

					In the meantime, the seven of us had seated ourselves around the dining table
					to await the latest addition to our family with coffee and cognac. Miep first
					led him into the Frank family's room. He immediately recognized our furniture,
					but had no idea we were upstairs, just above his head. When Miep told him, he
					was so astonished he nearly fainted. Thank goodness she didn't leave him in
					suspense any longer, but brought him upstairs. Mr. Dussel sank into a chair and
					stared at us in dumbstruck silence, as though he thought he could read the
					truth on our faces. Then he stuttered, "Aber... but are you nicht in Belgium?
					The officer, the auto, they were not coming? Your escape was not working?"

					come looking for us off the track. Mr. Dussel was speechless in the face of
					such ingenuity, and could do nothing but gaze around in surprise as he explored
					the rest of our lovely and ultrapractical Annex. We all had lunch together.
					Then he took a short nap, joined us for tea, put away the few belongings Miep
					had been able to bring here in advance and began to feel much more at home.
					Especially when we handed him the following typewritten rules and regulations
					for the Secret Annex (a van Daan production):

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Just as we thought, Mr. Dussel is a very nice man. Of course he didn't mind
					sharing a
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					room with me; to be honest, I'm not exactly delighted at having a stranger use
					my things, but you have to make sacrifices for a good cause, and I'm glad I can
					make this small one. "If we can save even one of our friends, the rest doesn't
					matter," said Father, and he's absolutely right.
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The first day Mr. Dussel was here, he asked me all sorts of questions — for
					example, what time the cleaning lady comes to the office, how we've arranged to
					use the washroom and when we're allowed to go to the toilet. You may laugh, but
					these things aren't so easy in a hiding place. During the daytime we can't make
					any noise that might be heard downstairs, and when someone else is there, like
					the cleaning lady, we have to be extra careful. I patiently explained all this
					to Mr. Dussel, but I was surprised to see how slow he is to catch on. He asks
					everything twice and still can't remember what you've told him.
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Maybe he's just confused by the sudden change and he'll get over it. Otherwise,
					everything is going fine.
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mr. Dussel has told us much about the outside world we've missed for so long.
					He had sad news. Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a
					dreadful fate. Night after night, green and gray military vehicles cruise the
					streets. They knock on every door, asking whether any Jews live there. If so,
					the whole family is immediately taken away. If not, they proceed to the next
					house. It's impossible to escape their clutches unless you go into hiding. They
					often go around with lists, knocking only on those doors where they know
					there's a big haul to be made. They frequently offer a bounty, so much per
					head. It's like the slave hunts of the olden days. I don't mean to make light
					ofthisj it's much too tragic for that. In the evenings when it's dark, I often
					see long lines of good, innocent people, accompanied by crying children,
					walking on and on, ordered about by a handful of men who bully and beat them
					until they nearly drop. No one is spared. The sick, the elderly, children,
					babies and pregnant women — all are marched to their death.
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					We're so fortunate here, away from the turmoil. We wouldn't have to give a
					moment's thought to all this suffering if it weren't for the fact that we're so
					worried about those we hold dear, whom we can no longer help. I feel wicked
					sleeping in a warm bed, while somewhere out there my dearest friends are
					dropping from exhaustion or being knocked to the ground.
				-
			-
				Entry 37 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1942: Paragraph 8

					I get frightened myself when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy

				-
			-
				Entry 38 - FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					We don't really know how to react. Up to now very little news about the Jews
					had reached us here, and we thought it best to stay as cheerful as possible.
					Every now and then Miep used to mention what had happened to a friend, and
					Mother or Mrs. van Daan would start to cry, so she decided it was better not to
					say any more. But we bombarded Mr. Dussel with questions, and the stories he
					had to tell were so gruesome and dreadful that we can't get them out of our
					heads. Once we've had time to digest the news, we'll probably go back to our
					usual joking and teasing. It won't do us or those outside any good if we
					continue to be as gloomy as we are now. And what would be the point of turning
					the Secret Annex into a Melancholy Annex?
				-
			-
				Entry 38 - FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					No matter what I'm doing, I can't help thinking about those who are gone. I
					catch myself laughing and remember that it's a disgrace to be so cheerful. But
					am I supposed to spend the whole day crying? No, I can't do that. This gloom
					will pass.
				-
			-
				Entry 38 - FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Added to this misery there's another, but of a more personal nature, and it
					pales in comparison to the suffering I've just told you about. Still, I can't
					help telling you that lately I've begun to feel deserted. I'm surrounded by too
					great a void. I never used to give it much thought, since my mind was filled
					with my friends and having a good time. Now I think either about unhappy things
					or about myself. It's taken a while, but I've finally realized that Father, no
					matter how kind he may be, can't take the place of my former world. When it
					comes to my feelings, Mother and Margot ceased to count long ago.
				-
			-
				Entry 38 - FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					But why do I bother you with this foolishness? I'm terribly ungrateful, Kitty,

					other woes to think about as well, my head begins to reel!

					We've been using too much electricity and have now exceeded our ration. The
					result:
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					excessive economy and the prospect of having the electricity cut off. No light
					for fourteen days; that's a pleasant thought, isn't it? But who knows, maybe it
					won't be so long! It's too dark to read after four or four-thirty, so we while
					away the time with all kinds of crazy activities: telling riddles, doing
					calisthenics in the dark, speaking English or French, reviewing books — after a
					while everything gets boring. Yesterday I discovered a new pastime: using a
					good pair of binoculars to peek into the lighted rooms of the neighbors. During
					the day our curtains can't be opened, not even an inch, but there's no harm
					when it's so dark.
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I never knew that neighbors could be so interesting. Ours are, at any rate.
					I've come across a few at dinner, one family making home movies and the dentist
					across the way working on a frightened old lady.
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Mr. Dussel, the man who was said to get along so well with children and to
					absolutely adore them, has turned out to be an old-fashioned disciplinarian and
					preacher of unbearably long sermons on manners. Since I have the singular
					pleasure (!) of sharing my far too narrow room with His Excellency, and since
					I'm generally considered to be the worst behaved of the three young people,
					it's all I can do to avoid having the same old scoldings and admonitions
					repeatedly flung at my head and to pretend not to hear. This wouldn't be so bad
					if Mr. Dussel weren't such a tattletale and hadn't
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					singled out Mother to be the recipient of his reports. If Mr. Dussel's just
					read me the riot act, Mother lectures me all over again, this time throwing the
					whole book at me. And if I'm really lucky, Mrs. van D. calls me to account five
					minutes later and lays down the law as well!
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 7

					Really, it's not easy being the badly brought -up center of attention of a

				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					In bed at night, as I ponder my many sins and exaggerated shortcomings, I get
					so confused by the sheer amount of things I have to consider that I either
					laugh or cry, depending on my mood. Then I fall asleep with the strange feeling
					of wanting to be different than I am or being different than I want to be, or
					perhaps of behaving differently than I am or want to be.
				-
			-
				Entry 39 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2g, 1942: Paragraph 9

					Oh dear, now I'm confusing you too. Forgive me, but I don't like crossing

				Entry 40 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Hanukkah and St. Nicholas Day nearly coincided this year; they were only one
					day apart. We didn't make much of a fuss with Hanukkah, merely exchanging a few
					small gifts and lighting the candles. Since candles are in short supply, we lit
					them for only ten minutes, but as long as we sing the song, that doesn't
					matter. Mr. van Daan made a menorah out of wood, so that was taken care of too.
				-
			-
				Entry 40 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					St. Nicholas Day on Saturday was much more fun. During dinner Bep and Miep were
					so busy whispering to Father that our curiosity was aroused and we suspected
					they were up to something. Sure enough, at eight o'clock we all trooped
					downstairs through the hall in pitch darkness (it gave me the shivers, and I
					wished I was safely back upstairs!) to the alcove. We could switch on the
					light, since this room doesn't have any windows. When that was done, Father
					opened the big cabinet.
				-
			-
				Entry 40 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 4

					"Oh, how wonderful!" we all cried.

				-
			-
				Entry 40 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1942: Paragraph 6

				-
					We quickly took the basket upstairs with us. Inside was a little gift for

					Mr. van Daan used to be in the meat, sausage and spice business. He was hired
					for his knowledge of spices, and yet, to our great delight, it's his sausage
					talents that have come in handy now.
				-
			-
				Entry 41 - THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					We ordered a large amount of meat (under the counter, of course) that we were
					planning to preserve in case there were hard times ahead. Mr. van Daan decided
					to make bratwurst, sausages and mettwurst. I had fun watching him put the meat
					through the grinder: once, twice, three times. Then he added the remaining
					ingredi ents to the ground meat and used a long pipe to force the mixture into
					the casings. We ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut for lunch, but the sausages,
					which were going to be canned, had to dry first, so we hung them over a pole
					suspended from the cethng. Everyone who came into the room burst into laughter
					when they saw the dangling sausages.lt was such a comical sight.
				-
			-
				Entry 41 - THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The kitchen was a shambles. Mr. van Daan, clad in his wife's apron and looking
					fatter than ever, was working away at the meat. What with his bloody hands, red
					face and spotted apron, he looked like a real butcher. Mrs. D. was trying to do
					everything at once: learning Dutch out of a book, stirring the soup, watching
					the meat, sighing and moaning about her broken rib. That's what happens when
					old (!) ladies do such stupid exercises to get rid of their fat behinds! Dussel
					had an eye infection and was sitting next to the stove dabbing his eye with
					camomile tea. Pirn, seated in the one ray of sunshine coming through the
					window, kept having to move his chair this way and that to stay out of the way.
					His rheumatism must have been bothering him because he was slightly hunched
					over and was keeping an eye on Mr. van Daan with an agonized expression on his
					face. He reminded me of those aged invalids you see in the poor-house. Peter
					was romping around the room with Mouschi, the cat, while Mother, Margot and I
					were peeling boiled potatoes. When you get right down to it, none of us were
					doing our work properly, because we were all so busy watching Mr. van Daan.
				-
			-
				Entry 41 - THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Dussel has opened his dental practice. Just for fun, I'll describe the session
					with his very first patient.
				-
			-
				Entry 41 - THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mother was ironing, and Mrs. van D., the first victim, sat down on a chair in
					the middle of the room. Dussel, unpacking his case with an air of importance,
					asked for some eau de cologne, which could be used as a disinfectant, and
					vaseline, which would have to do for wax. He looked in Mrs. van D.'s mouth and
					found two teeth that made her wince with pain and utter incoherent cries every
					time he touched them. After a lengthy examination (lengthy as far as Mrs. van
					D. was concerned, since it actually took no longer than two minutes), Dussel
					began to scrape out a cavity. But Mrs. van D. had no intention of letting him.
					She flailed her arms and legs until Dussel finally let go of his probe and
					it... remained stuck in Mrs. van D.'s tooth. That really did it! Mrs. van D.
					lashed out wildly in all directions, cried (as much as you can with an
					instrument like that in your mouth), tried to remove it, but only managed to
					push it in even farther. Mr. Dussel calmly observed the scene, his hands on his
					hips, while the rest of the audience roared with laughter. Of course, that was
					very mean of us. If it'd been me, I'm sure I would have yelled even louder.
					After a great deal of squirming, kicking, screaming and shouting, Mrs. van D.
					finally managed to yank the thing out, and Mr. Dussel went on with his work as
					if nothing had happened. He was so quick that Mrs. van D. didn't have time to
					pull any more shenanigans. But then, he had more help than he's ever had
					before: no fewer than two assis tants! Mr. van D. and I performed our job well.
					The whole scene resembled one of those engravings from the Middle Ages
					entitled" A Quack at Work." In the meantime, however, the patient was getting
					restless, since she had to keep an eye on "her" soup and "her" food. One thing
					is certain: it'll be a while before Mrs. van D. makes another dental
					appointment!

					It's really strange watching people walk past. They all seem to be in such a

					way, speaking of Jews, I saw two yesterday when I was peeking through ; the
					curtains. I felt as though I were gazing at one of the Seven Wonders of the
					World. It gave me such a funny feeling, as if I'd denounced them to the
					authorities and was now spying on their misfortune.

					Across from us is a houseboat. The captain lives there with his wife and
					children. He has a small yapping dog. We know the little dog only by its bark
					and by its tail, which we can see whenever it runs around the deck. Oh, what a
					shame, it's just started raining and most of the people are hidden under their
					umbrellas. All I can see are raincoats, and now and again the back of a
					stocking-capped head. Actually, I don't even need to look. By now I can
					recognize the women at a glance: gone to fat from eating potatoes, dressed in a
					red or green coat and worn-out shoes, a shopping bag dangling from their arms,
					with faces that are either grim or good-humored, depending on the mood of their
					husbands.

				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					The Annex was delighted to hear that we'll all be receiving an extra quarter
					pound of butter for Christmas. According to the newspaper, everyone is entitled
					to half a pound, but they mean those lucky souls who get their ration books
					from the government, not Jews in hiding like us who can only afford to buy four
					rather than eight ration books on the black market. Each of us is going to bake
					something with the butter. This morning I made two cakes and a batch of
					cookies. It's very busy upstairs, and Mother has informed me that I'm not to do
					any studying or reading until all the household chores have been finished.

			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan is lying in bed nursing her bruised rib. She complains all day
					long, constantly demands that the bandages be changed and is generally
					dissatisfied with everything. I'll be glad when she gets back on her feet and
					can clean up after herself because, I must admit, she's extraordinarily
					hardworking and neat, and as long as she's in good physical and mental
					condition, she's quite cheerful.
				-
			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					As if I don't hear "shh, shh" enough during the day because I'm always making
					"too much" noise, my dear roommate has come up with the idea of saying "shh,
					shh" to me all night too. According to him, I shouldn't even turn over. I
					refuse to take any notice of him, and the next time he shushes me, I'm going to
					shush him right back.
				-
			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					He gets more exasperating and egotistical as the days go by. Except for the
					first week, I haven't seen even one of the cookies he so generously promised
					me. He's partic ularly infuriating on Sundays, when he switches on the light at
					the crack of dawn to exercise for ten minutes.

			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					To me, the torment seems to last for hours, since the chairs I use to make my
					bed longer are constantly being jiggled under my sleepy head. After rounding
					off his limbering-up exercises with a few vigorous arm swings, His Lordship
					begins dressing. His underwear is hanging on a hook, so first he lumbers over
					to get it and then lumbers back, past my bed. But his tie is on the table, so
					once again he pushes and bumps his way past the chairs.
				-
			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					But I mustn't waste any more of your time griping about disgusting old men. It
					won't help matters anyway. My plans for revenge, such as unscrewing the
					lightbulb, locking the door and hiding his clothes, have unfortu nately had to
					be abandoned in the interests of peace.
				-
			-
				Entry 43 - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1942: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Oh, I'm becoming so sensible! We've got to be reasonable about everything we do
					here: studying, listen ing, holding our tongues, helping others, being kind,
					making compromises and I don't know what else! I'm afraid my common sense,
					which was in short supply to begin with, will be used up too quickly and I
					won't have any left by the time the war is over.

				-
			-
				Entry 44 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					We have a new pastime, namely, filling packages with powdered gravy. The gravy
					is one of Gies & Co.'s products. Mr. Kugler hasn't been able to find anyone
					else to fill the packages, and besides, it's cheaper if we do the job. It's the
					kind of work they do in prisons. It's incredibly boring and makes us dizzy and
					giggly.
				-
			-
				Entry 44 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Terrible things are happening outside. At any time of night and day, poor
					helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. They're allowed to take
					only a knapsack and a little cash with them, and even then, they're robbed of
					these possessions on the way. Families are torn apart; men, women and children
					are separated. Children come home from school to find that their parents have
					disap peared. Women return from shopping to find their houses sealed, their
					famthes gone. The Christians in Holland are also living in fear because their
					sons are being sent to Germany. Everyone is scared. Every night hundreds of
					planes pass over Holland on their way to German cities, to sow their bombs on
					German soil. Every hour hundreds, or maybe even thousands, of people are being
					killed in Russia and Africa. No one can keep out of the conflict, the entire
					world is at war, and even though the Allies are doing better, the end is
					nowhere in sight.
				-
			-
				Entry 44 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					As for us, we're quite fortunate. Luckier than millions of people. It's quiet
					and safe here, and we're using our money to buy food. We're so selfish that we
					talk about "after the war" and look forward to new clothes and shoes, when
					actually we should be saving every penny to help others when the war is over,
					to salvage whatever we can.
				-
			-
				Entry 44 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The children in this neighborhood run around in thin shirts and wooden shoes.
					They have no coats, no caps, no stockings and no one to help them. Gnawing on a
					carrot to still their hunger pangs, they walk from their cold houses through
					cold streets to an even colder classroom. Things have gotten so bad in Holland
					that hordes of children stop passersby in the streets to beg for a piece of
					bread.
				-
			-
				Entry 44 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I could spend hours telling you about the suffering the war has brought, but
					I'd only make myself more miserable. All we can do is wait, as calmly as
					possible, for it to end. Jews and Christians alike are waiting, the whole world
					is waiting, and many are waiting for death.

				Entry 45 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I'm seething with rage, yet I can't show it. I'd like to scream, stamp my foot,
					give Mother a good shaking, cry and I don't know what else because of the nasty
					words, mocking looks and accusations that she hurls at me day after day,
					piercing me like arrows from a tightly strung bow, which are nearly impossible
					to pull from my body. I'd like to scream at Mother, Margot, the van Daans,
					Dussel and Father too: "Leave me alone, let me have at least one night when I
					don't cry myself to sleep with my eyes burning and my head pounding. Let me get
					away, away from everything, away from this world!" But I can't do that. I can't
					let them see my doubts, or the wounds they've inflicted on me. I couldn't bear
					their sympathy or their good-humored derision. It would only make me want to
					scream even more.
				-
			-
				Entry 45 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Everyone thinks I'm showing off when I talk, ridicu lous when I'm silent,
					insolent when I answer, cunning when I have a good idea, lazy when I'm tired,
					selfish when I eat one bite more than I should, stupid, cowardly, calculating,
					etc., etc. All day long I hear nothing but what an exasperating child I am, and
					although I laugh it off and pretend not to mind, I do mind. I wish I could ask
					God to give me another personality, one that doesn't antagonize everyone.
				-
			-
				Entry 45 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					But that's impossible. I'm stuck with the character I was born with, and yet
					I'm sure I'm not a bad person. I do my best to please everyone, more than
					they'd ever suspect in a million years. When I'm upstairs, I try to laugh it
					off because I don't want them to see my troubles.
				-
			-
				Entry 45 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					More than once, after a series of absurd reproaches, I've snapped at Mother: "I
					don't care what you say. Why don't you just wash your hands of me — I'm a
					hopeless case." Of course, she'd tell me not to talk back and virtually ignore
					me for two days. Then suddenly all would be forgotten and she'd treat me like
					everyone else.
				-
			-
				Entry 45 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					It's impossible for me to be all smiles one day and venomous the next. I'd
					rather choose the golden mean, which isn't so golden, and keep my thoughts to
					myself. Perhaps sometime I'll treat the others with the same contempt as they
					treat me. Oh, if only I could.

				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Though it's been ages since I've written to you about the squabbles, there's
					still no change. In the begin ning Mr. Dussel took our soon-forgotten clashes
					very seriously, but now he's grown used to them and no longer tries to mediate.
				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Margot and Peter aren't exactly what you'd call "young"; they're both so quiet
					and boring. Next to them, I stick out like a sore thumb, and I'm always being
					told, "Margot and Peter don't act that way. Why don't you follow your sister's
					example!" I hate that.
				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I confess that I have absolutely no desire to be like Margot. She's too
					weak-willed and passive to suit me; she lets herself be swayed by others and
					always backs down under pressure. I want to have more spunk! But I keep ideas
					like these to myself. They'd only laugh at me if I offered this in my defense.
				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					During meals the air is filled with tension. Fortunately, the outbursts are

				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					This afternoon Mr. van Daan again brought up the fact that Margot eats so

				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 7

				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Still, we often have a good laugh. Not long ago Mrs. van D. was entertaining us
					with some bit of nonsense or another. She was talking about the past, about how
					well she got along with her father and what a flirt she was. "And you know,"
					she continued, "my father told me that if a gentleman ever got fresh, I was to
					say, 'Remem ber, sir, that I'm a lady,' and he'd know what I meant." We split
					our sides laughing, as if she'd told us a good joke.
				-
			-
				Entry 46 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Even Peter, though he's usually quiet, occasionally gives rise to hilarity. He
					has the misfortune of adoring foreign words without knowing what they mean. One
					afternoon we couldn't use the toilet because there were visitors in the office.
					Unable to wait, he went to the bathroom but didn't flush the toilet. To warn us
					of the unpleasant odor, he tacked a sign to the bathroom door: "RSVP — gas!" Of
					course, he meant "Danger — gas!" but he thought "RSVP" looked more elegant. He
					didn't have the faintest idea that it meant "please reply."

					Jan brought along the episcopal letter that the bishops addressed to their

					Guess what's happened to us now? The owner of the building sold it without

					an architect to look the place over. Thank goodness Mr. Kleiman was in the
					office. He showed the gentlemen all there was to see, with the exception of the
					Secret Annex. He claimed he'd left the key at home and the new owner asked no

					There's a new division of butter and margarine. Each person is to get their

					always make breakfast for everyone, give themselves one and a half times more
					than they do us. My parents are much too afraid of an argument to say anything,
					which is a shame, because I think people like that should always be given a

					Mrs. van D. has a new nickname — we've started calling her Mrs. Beaverbrook. Of
					course, that doesn't mean anything to you, so let me explain. A certain Mr.
					Beaverbrook often talks on the English radio about what he considers to be the
					far too lenient bombardment of Germany. Mrs. van Daan, who always contradicts
					everyone, including Churchill and the news reports, is in complete agreement
					with Mr. Beaverbrook. So we thought it would be a good idea for her to be
					married to him, and since she was flattered by the notion, we've decided to
					call her Mrs. Beaverbrook from now on.

					We're getting a new warehouse employee, since the old one is being sent to

					crawl into
				-
			-
				Entry 49 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Father's bed nearly every night for comfort. I know it sounds childish, but
					wait till it happens to you! The ack-ack guns make so much noise you can't hear
					your own voice. Mrs. Beaverbrook, the fatalist, practically burst into tears
					and said in a timid little voice, "Oh, it's so awful. Oh, the guns are so
					loud!" — which is another way of saying "I'm so scared."

			-
				-
					Father to relight the candle. He was adamant: there was to be no light.
					Suddenly we heard a burst of machine-gun fire, and that's ten times worse than
					antiaircraft guns. Mother jumped out of bed and, to Pirn's great annoyance, lit

					Have I told you any of Mrs. van D.'s other fears? I don't think so. To keep you
					up to date on the latest adventures in the Secret Annex, I should tell you this
					as well. One night Mrs. van D. thought she heard loud footsteps in the attic,
					and she was so afraid of burglars, she woke her husband. At that very same
					moment, the thieves disappeared, and the only sound Mr. van D. could hear was
					the frightened pounding of his fatalistic wife's heart. "Oh, Putti!" she cried.
					(Putti is Mrs. van D.'s pet name for her husband.) "They must have taken all
					our sausages and dried beans. And what about Peter? Oh, do you think Peter's
					still safe and sound in his bed?"

					A few evenings ago (it was seven-thirty and still light), Peter went up to the

					climb down the ladder. He put down his hand without looking, and nearly fell
					off the ladder from shock and pain. Without realizing it, he'd put his hand on
					a large rat, which had bitten him in the arm. By the time he reached us, white
					as a sheet and with his knees

			-
				Entry 49 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 10, 1943: Paragraph 12

					Co. had two cats: one for the warehouse and one for the attic. Their paths
					crossed from time to time, which invariably resulted in a fight. The warehouse
					cat was always the aggressor, while the attic cat was ultimately the victor,
					just as in politics. So the warehouse cat was named the German, or "Boche," and
					the attic cat the Englishman, or "Tommy." Sometime after that they got rid of
					Tommy, but Boche is always there to amuse us when we go downstairs.

				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					In less than an hour, joy was followed by disappoint ment. Turkey hasn't
					entered the war yet. It was only a cabinet minister talking about Turkey giving
					up its neu trality sometime soon. The newspaper vendor in Dam Square was
					shouting "Turkey on England's side!" and the papers were being snatched out of
					his hands. This was how we'd heard the encouraging rumor.

			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Thousand-guilder notes are being declared invalid. That'll be a blow to the

					anyone else with money that can't be accounted for. To turn in a
					thousand-guilder bill, you have to be able to state how you came by it and
					provide proof. They can still be used to pay taxes, but only until next week.
					The five-hundred notes will lapse at the same time. Gies & Co. still had some
					unaccounted-for thousand- guilder bills, which they used to pay their estimated
					taxes for the coming years, so everything seems to be aboveboard.

				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 4

					Dussel has received an old-fashioned, foot-operated dentist's drill. That means

				-
			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Dussel is terribly lax when it comes to obeying the rules of the house. Not
					only does he write letters to his Charlotte, he's also carrying on a chatty
					correspondence with various other people. Margot, the Annex's Dutch teacher,
					has been correcting these letters for him. Father has forbidden him to keep up
					the practice and Margot has stopped correcting the letters, but I think it
					won't be long before he starts up again.

				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The Fuhrer has been talking to wounded soldiers. We listened on the radio, and
					it was pathetic. The questions and answers went something like this:
				-
			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					"My name is Fleinrich Scheppel."
				-
			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					"Where were you wounded?"
				-
			-

					"Near Stalingrad."
				-
			-

			-
				-
					"What kind of wound is it?"
				-
			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 11

				-
					"Two frostbitten feet and a fracture of the left arm."
				-
			-
				Entry 52 - FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1943: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					This is an exact report of the hideous puppet show aired on the radio. The
					wounded seemed proud of their wounds — the more the better. One was so beside
					himself at the thought of shaking hands (I presume he still had one) with the
					Fuhrer that he could barely say a word.

					I happened to drop Dussel's soap on the floor and step on it. Now there's a

			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mother, Father, Margot and I were sitting quite pleasantly together last night
					when Peter suddenly came in and whispered in Father's ear. I caught the words
					"a barrel falling over in the warehouse" and "someone fiddling with the door."
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Margot heard it too, but was trying to calm me down, since I'd turned white as
					chalk and was extremely nervous. The three of us waited while Father and Peter
					went downstairs. A minute or two later Mrs. van Daan came up from where she'd
					been listening to the radio and told us that Pirn had asked her to turn it off
					and tiptoe upstairs. But you know what happens when you're trying to be quiet —
					the old stairs creaked twice as loud. Five minutes later Peter and Pirn, the
					color drained from their faces, appeared again to relate their experiences.
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					They had positioned themselves under the staircase and waited. Nothing
					happened. Then all of a sudden they heard a couple of bangs, as if two doors
					had been slammed shut inside the house. Pirn bounded up the stairs, while Peter
					went to warn Dussel, who finally pre sented himself upstairs, though not
					without kicking up a fuss and making a lot of noise. Then we all tiptoed in our
					stockinged feet to the van Daans on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold
					and had already gone to bed, so we gathered around his bedside and discussed
					our suspicions in a whisper. Every time Mr. van D. coughed loudly, Mrs. van D.
					and I nearly had a nervous fit. He kept coughing until someone came up with the
					bright idea of giving him codeine. His cough subsided immediately.
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Once again we waited and waited, but heard nothing. Finally we came to the
					conclusion that the burglars had taken to their heels when they heard footsteps
					in an otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the
					private office were neatly grouped around the radio, which was tuned to
					England. If the burglars had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to
					notice it and call the police, there could be very serious repercus sions. So
					Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat and pants, put on his hat and
					cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter (armed with a heavy
					hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies (including Margot
					and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes later and
					reported that there was no sign of any activity in the building. We agreed not
					to run any water or flush the toilet; but since everyone's stomach was churning
					from all the tension, you can imagine the stench after we'd each had a turn in
					the bathroom.
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no
					exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and I'd always
					found them so comforting. Number two: Mr. Voskuijlleft early last night, and we
					weren't sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door.
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					But that was of little importance now. The night had just begun, and we still
					weren't sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that
					between eight-fifteen — when the burglar had first entered the building and put
					our lives in jeopardy, and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we
					thought about it, the less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a
					door so early in the evening, when there were still people out on the streets.
					Besides that, it occurred to us that the warehouse manager at the Keg Company
					next door might still have been at work. What with the excitement and the thin
					walls, it's easy to mistake the sounds. Besides, your imagination often plays
					tricks on you in moments of danger.
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					So we went to bed, though not to sleep. Father and Mother and Mr. Dussel were
					awake most of the night, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I hardly got
					a wink of sleep. This morning the men went downstairs to see if the outside
					door was still locked, but all was well!
				-
			-
				Entry 53 - THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Of course, we gave the entire office staff a blow-by-blow account of the
					incident, which had been far from pleasant. It's much easier to laugh at these
					kinds of things after they've happened, and Bep was the only one who took us
					seriously.

					wooden pole and fish out several pounds of excrement and strawberry recipes
					(which is what we use for toilet paper these days). Afterward we burned the
					pole.

					We've finished our shorthand course and are now working on improving our speed.
					Aren't we smart! Let me tell you more about my "time killers" (this is what I
					call my courses, because all we ever do is try to make the days go by as
					quickly as possible so we are that much closer to the end of our time here). I
					adore mythology, espe dally the Greek and Roman gods. Everyone here thinks my

					an appreciation of mythology. Well then, I guess I'm the first!

				Entry 54 - SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-

					Mr. van Daan has a cold. Or rather, he has a scratchy throat, but he's making
					an enormous to-do over it. He gargles with camomile tea, coats the roof of his
					mouth with a tincture of myrrh and rubs Mentholatum over his chest, nose, gums
					and tongue. And to top it off, he's in a foul mood!
				-
			-
				Entry 54 - SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1943: Paragraph 4

				-
					Rauter, some German bigwig, recently gave a speech. "All Jews must be out of
					the German-occupied territories before July 1. The province of Utrecht will be
					cleansed of Jews [as if they were cockroaches] between April 1 and May 1, and
					the provinces of North and South Holland between May 1 and June 1." These poor
					people are being shipped off to filthiy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick and
					neglected cattle. But I'll say no more on the subject. My own thoughts give me

					On the contrary, today I can safely quote the saying" Misfortunes never come
					singly." First, Mr. Kleiman, our merry sunshine, had another bout of
					gastrointestinal hemorrhaging yesterday and will have to stay in bed for at
					least three weeks. I should tell you that his stomach has been bothering him
					quite a bit, and there's no cure. Second, Bep has the flu. Third, Mr. Voskuijl
					has to go to the hospital next week. He probably has an ulcer and will have to
					undergo surgery. Fourth, the managers of Pomosin Industries came from Frankfurt
					to discuss the new Opekta deliveries. Father had gone yer the important points

					briefing.
				-
			-
				Entry 55 - THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1943: Paragraph 4

					Father's face cleared, and yesterday morning at ten-thirty Margot and Pirn (two
					ears are better than one) took up their posts on the floor. By noon the talks
					weren't finished, but Father was in no shape to continue his listen ing
					campaign. He was in agony from having to lie for hours in such an unusual and
					uncomfortable position. At two-thirty we heard voices in the hall, and I took
					his place; Margot kept me company. The conversation was so long-winded and
					boring that I suddenly fell asleep on the cold, hard linoleum. Margot didn't
					dare touch me for fear they'd hear us, and of course she couldn't shout. I
					slept for a good half hour and then awoke with a start, having forgotten every
					word of the important discussion. Luckily, Margot had paid more attention.

					Oh my, another item has been added to my list of sins. Last night— was lying in
					bed, waiting for Father to tuck me in an say my prayers with me, when Mother
					came into the room, sat on my bed and asked very gently, "Anne, Daddy isn't
					ready. How about if I listen to your prayers tonight?"
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 3

					"No, Momsy," I replied.
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mother got up, stood beside my bed for a moment and then slowly walked toward
					the door. Suddenly she turned, her face contorted with pain, and said, "I don't
					want to be angry with you. I can't make you love me!" A few tears slid down her
					cheeks as she went out the door.
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I lay still, thinking how mean it was of me to reject her so cruelly, but I
					also knew that I was incapable of answering her any other way. I can't be a
					hypocrite and pray with her when I don't feel like it. It just doesn't work
					that way. I felt sorry for Mother — very, very sorry — because for the first
					time in my life I noticed she wasn't indifferent to my coldness. I saw the
					sorrow in her face when she talked about not being able to make me love her.
					It's hard to tell the truth, and yet the truth is that she's the one who's
					rejected me. She's the one whose tactless comments and cruel jokes about
					matters I don't think are funny have made me insensitive to any sign of love on
					her part. Just as my heart sinks every time I hear her harsh words, that's how
					her heart sank when she realized there was no more love between us.
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					She cried half the night and didn't get any sleep. Father has avoided looking

					"How can you be so unkind? How dare you make your mother so sad!"
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Everyone expects me to apologize, but this is not something I can apologize
					for, because I told the truth, and sooner or later Mothjr was bound to find out
					anyway. I seem to be indifferent to Mother's tears and Father's glances, and I
					am, because both of them are now feeling what I've always felt. I can only feel
					sorry for Mother, who will have to figure out what her attitude should be all
					by herself. For my part, I will
				-
			-
				Entry 56 - FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 1943: Paragraph 8

					Yesterday was Dussel's birthday. At first he acted as if he didn't want to
					celebrate it, but when Miep arrived with a large shopping bag overflowing with
					gifts, he was as excited as a little kid. His darling' 'Lotje" has sent him
					eggs, butter, cookies, lemonade, bread, cognac, spice cake, flowers, oranges,
					chocolate, books and writing paper. He piled his presents on a table and
					displayed them for no fewer than three days, the silly old goat!
				-
			-
				Entry 58 - SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1943: Paragraph 3

					You mustn't get the idea that he's starving. We found bread, cheese, jam and
					eggs in his cupboard. It's absolutely disgraceful that Dussel, whom we've
					treated with such kindness and whom we took in to save from destruction, should
					stuff himself behind our backs and not give us anything. After all, we've
					shared all we had with him! But what's worse, in our opinion, is that he's so
					stingy with respect to Mr. Kleiman, Mr. Voskuijl and Bep. He doesn't give them
					a thing. In Dussel's view the oranges that Kleiman so badly needs for his sick
					stomach will benefit his own stomach even more.

					When I think about our lives here, I usually come to the conclusion that we
					live in a paradise compared to the Jews who aren't in hiding. All the same,
					later on, when everything has returned to normal, I'll probably wonder how we,
					who always lived in such comfortable circumstances, could have "sunk" so low.
					With respect to manners, I mean. For example, the same oilcloth has covered the
					dining table ever since we've been here. After so much use, it's hardly what
					you'd call spotless. I do my best to clean it, but since the dishcloth was also
					purchased before we went into hiding and consists of more holes than cloth,
					it's a thankless task. The van Daans have been sleeping all winter long on the
					same flannel sheet, which can't be washed because detergent is rationed and in
					short supply. Besides, it's of such poor quality that it's practically useless.
					Father is walking around in frayed trousers, and his tie is also showing signs
					of wear and tear. Mama's corset snapped today and is beyond repair, while
					Margot is wearing a bra that's two sizes too small, Mother and Margot have
					shared the same three undershorts the entire winter, and mine are so small they
					don't even cover my stomach. These are all things that can be overcome, but I
					sometimes wonder: how can we, whose every possession, from my underpants to
					Father's shaving brush, is so old and worn, ever hope to regain the position we
					had before the war?

				Entry 60 - SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan. In the opinion of us all, this revered gentleman has great
					insight into politics. Nevertheless, he predicts we'll have to stay here until
					the end of '43. That's a very long time, and yet it's possible to hold out
					until then. But who can assure us that this war, which has caused nothing but
					pain and sorrow, will then be over? And that nothing will have happened to us
					and our helpers long before that time? No one! That's why each and every day is
					filled with tension. Expectation and hope generate tension, as does fear — for
					example, when we hear a noise inside or outside the house, when the guns go off
					or when we read new "proclamations" in the paper, since we're afraid our
					helpers might be forced to go into hiding themselves sometime. These days
					everyone is talking about having to hide. We don't know how many people are
					actually in hiding; of course, the number is relatively small compared to the
					general population, but later on we'll no doubt be astonished at how many good
					people in Holland were willing to take Jews and Christians, with or without
					money, into their homes. There're also an unbelievable number of people with
					false identity papers.

					Mrs. van Daan. When this beautiful damsel (by her own account) heard that it
					was getting easier these days to obtain false IDs, she immediately proposed
					that we each have one made. As if there were nothing to it, as if Father and
					Mr. van Daan were made of money.

				Entry 60 - SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1943: Paragraph 4

					Mrs. van Daan is always sating the most ridiculous things, and her Putti is

					I recently witnessed a fierce dogfight between German and English pilots.
					Unfortunately, a couple of Allied airmen had to jump out of their burning
					plane. Our milkman, who lives in Halfweg, saw four Canadians sitting along the
					side of the road, and one of them spoke fluent Dutch. He asked the milkman if
					he had a light for his cigarette, and then told him the crew had consisted of
					six men. The pilot had been burned to death, and the fifth crew member had
					hidden himself somewhere. The German Security Police came to pick up the four
					remaining men, none of whom were injured. After parachuting out of a flaming
					plane, how can anyone have such presence of mind?

					Although it's undeniably hot, we have to light a fire every other day to burn

					Eighty percent have decided to obey the dictates of their conscience, but the

					labor camp. What's to become of the youth of our country if they've all got to
					do hard labor in Germany?

					Last night the guns were making so much noise that Mother shut the window; I
					was in Pirn's bed. Suddenly, right above our heads, we heard Mrs. van D. leap
					up, as if she'd been bitten by Mouschi. This was followed by a loud boom, which
					sounded as if a firebomb had landed beside my bed. "Lights! Lights!" I
					screamed.

			-
				Entry 61 - TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1943: Paragraph 6

				-
					Pirn switched on the lamp. I expected the room to burst into flames any minute.
					Nothing happened. We all rushed upstairs to see what was going on. Mr. and Mrs.
					van D. had seen a red glow through the open window, and he thought there was a
					fire nearby, while she was certain our house was ablaze. Mrs. van D. was
					already standing beside her bed with her knees knocking when the boom came.
					Dussel stayed upstairs to smoke a cigarette, and we crawled back into bed. Less
					than fifteen minutes later the shooting started again. Mrs. van D. sprang out
					of bed and went downstairs to Dussel' s room to seek the comfort she was unable
					to find with her spouse. Dussel welcomed her with the words "Come into my bed,
					my child!"

					Mr. Voskuijl wasn't operated on for his ulcer after all. Once the doctors had
					him on the operating table and opened him up, they saw that he had cancer. It
					was in such an advanced stage that an operation was pointless. So they stitched
					him up again, kept him in the hospital for three weeks, fed him well and sent
					him back home. But they made an unforgivable error: they told the poor man
					exactly what was in store for him. He can't work anymore, and he's just sitting
					at home, surrounded by his eight children, brooding about his approaching
					death. I feel very sorry for him and hate not being able to go out; otherwise,
					I'd visit him as often as I could and help take his mind off matters. Now the
					good man can no longer let us know what's being said and done in the warehouse,
					which is a disaster for us. Mr. Voskuijl was our greatest source of help and
					suppor when it came to safety measures. We miss him very much.

					Next month it's our turn to hand over our radio to the authorities. Mr. Kleiman

				Entry 64 - SUNDAY, JULY 11, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					To get back to the subject of child-rearing (for the umpteenth time), let me
					tell you that I'm doing my best to be helpful, friendly and kind and to do all
					I can to keep the rain of rebukes down to a light drizzle. It's not easy trying
					to behave like a model child with people you can't stand, especially when you
					don't mean a word of it. But I can see that a little hypocrisy gets me a lot
					further than myoid method of saying exactly what I think (even though no one
					ever asks my opinion or cares one way or another). Of course, I often forget my
					role and find it impossible to curb my anger when they're unfair, so that they
					spend the next month saying the most impertinent girl in the world. Don't you
					think I'm to be pitied sometimes? It's a good thing I'm not the grouchy type,
					because then I might become sour and bad-tempered. I can usually see the
					humorous side of their scoldings, but it's easier when somebody else is being
					raked over the coals.
				-
			-
				Entry 64 - SUNDAY, JULY 11, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Further, I've decided (after a great deal of thought) to drop the shorthand.
					First, so that I have more time for my other subjects, and second, because of
					my eyes. That's a sad story. I've become very nearsighted and should have had
					glasses ages ago. (Ugh, won't I look like a dope!). But as you know, people in
					hiding can't. . .
				-
			-
				Entry 64 - SUNDAY, JULY 11, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Yesterday all anyone here could talk about was Anne's eyes, because Mother had
					suggested I go to the ophthalmologist with Mrs. Kleiman. Just hearing this made
					my knees weak, since it's no small matter. Going outside! Just think of it,
					walking down the street! I can't imagine it. I was petrified at first, and then
					glad. But it's not as simple as all that; the various authorities who had to
					approve such a step were unable to reach a quick decision. They first had to
					carefully weigh all the difficulties and risks, though Miep was ready to set
					off immediately with me in tow. In the meantime, I'd taken my gray coat from
					the closet, but it was so small it looked as if it might have belonged to my
					little sister. We lowered the hem, but I still couldn't button it. I'm really
					curious to see what they decide, only I don't think they'll ever work out a
					plan, because the British have landed in Sicily and Father's all set for a
					"quick finish."

					Bep's been giving Margot and me a lot of office work to do. It makes us both

					Miep has so much to carry she looks like a pack mule. She goes forth nearly

					The Best Little Table
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Yesterday afternoon Father gave me permission to ask Mr. Dussel whether he
					would please be so good as to allow me (see how polite I am?) to use the table
					in our room two afternoons a week, from four to five-thirty. I already sit
					there every day from two -thirty to four while Dussel takes a nap, but the rest
					of the time the room and the table are off-limits to me. It's impossible to
					study next door in the afternoon, because there's too much going on. Besides,
					Father sometimes likes to sit at the desk during the afternoon.
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					So it seemed like a reasonable request, and I asked Dussel very politely. What
					do you think the learned gentleman's reply was? "No." Just plain "No!"
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I was incensed and wasn't about to let myself be put off like that. I asked him
					the reason for his "No," but this didn't get me anywhere. The gist of his reply
					was: "I have to study too, you know, and if I can't do that in the afternoons,
					I won't be able to fit it in at all. I have to finish the task I've set for
					myself; otherwise, there's no point in starting. Besides, you aren't serious
					about your studies. Mythology — what kind of work is that? Reading and knitting
					don't count either. I use that table and I'm not going to give it up!"
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I replied, "Mr. Dussel, I do take my wsork seriously. I can't study next door
					in the afternoons, and I would appreciate it if you would reconsider my
					request!"
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Having said these words, the insulted Anne turned around and pretended the
					learned doctor wasn't there. I was seething with rage and felt that Dussel had
					been incredibly rude (which he certainly had been) and that I'd been very
					polite.
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					That evening, when I managed to get hold of Pirn, I told him what had happened
					and we discussed what my next step should be, because I had no intention of
					giving up and preferred to deal with the matter myself. Pirn gave me a rough
					idea of how to approach Dussel, but cautioned me to wait until the next day,
					since I was in such a flap. I ignored this last piece of advice and waited for
					Dussel after the dishes had been done. Pirn was sitting next door and that had
					a calming effect.
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I began, "Mr. Dussel, you seem to believe further discussion of the matter is
					pointless, but I beg you to reconsider."
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Dussel gave me his most charming smile and said, "I'm always prepared to
					discuss the matter, even though it's already been settled."
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I went on talking, despite Dussel's repeated interruptions. When you first came
					here," I said, "we agreed that the room was to be shared by the two of us. If
					we were to divide it fairly, you'd have the entire morning and I'd have the
					entire afternoon! I'm not asking for that much, but two afternoons a week does
					seem reasonable to me."
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Dussel leapt out of his chair as if he'd sat on a pin. "You have no business
					talking about your rights to the room. Where am I supposed to go? Maybe I
					should ask Mr. van Daan to build me a cubbyhole in the attic. You're not the
					only one who can't find a quiet place to work. You're always looking for a
					fight. If your sister Margot, who has more right to work space than you do, had
					come to me with the same request, I'd never even have thought of refusing, but
					you. .
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					And once again he brought up the business about the mythology and the knitting,
					and once again Anne was insulted. However, I showed no sign of it and let
					Dussel finish:
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					"But no, it's impossible to talk to you. You're shamefully self-centered. No
					one else matters, as long as you get your way. I've never seen such a child.
					But after all is said and done, I'll be obliged to let you have your way, since
					I don't want people saying later on that Anne Frank failed her exams because
					Mr. Dussel refused to relinquish his table!"
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					He went on and on until there was such a deluge of words I could hardly keep
					up. For one fleeting moment I thought, "Him and his lies. I'll smack his ugly
					mug so hard he'll go bouncing off the wall!" But the next moment I thought,
					"Calm down, he's not worth getting so upset about!"
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					At long last Mr. Dussel' s fury was spent, and he left the room with an
					expression of triumph mixed with wrath, his coat pockets bulging with food.
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 16
			-

					I went running over to Father and recounted the entire story, or at least those
					parts he hadn't been able to follow himself, rim decided to talk to Dussel that
					very same evening, and they spoke for more than half an hour.

			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					They first discussed whether Anne should be allowed to use the table, yes or
					no. Father said that he and Dussel had dealt with the subject once before, at
					which time he'd professed to agree with Dussel because he didn't want to
					contradict the elder in front of the younger, but that, even then, he hadn't
					thought it was fair. Dussel felt I had no right to talk as if he were an
					intruder laying claim to everything in sight. But Father protested strongly,
					since he himself had heard me say nothing of the kind. And so the conversation
					went back and forth, with Father defending my "selfishness" and my "busywork"
					and Dussel grumbling the whole time.
				-
			-
				Entry 65 - TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Dussel finally had to give in, and I was granted the opportunity to work
					without interruption two afternoons a week. Dussel looked very sullen, didn't
					speak to me for two days and made sure he occupied the table from five to
					five-thirty — all very childish, of course.

					There's been another break-in, but this time a real one! Peter went down to the
					warehouse this morning at seven, as usual, and noticed at once that both the

			-
				Entry 66 - FRIDAY, JULY 16, 1943: Paragraph 3

				-
					warehouse door and the street door were open. He immediately reported this to
					Pirn, who went to the private office, tuned the radio to a German station and
					locked the door. Then they both went back upstairs. In such cases our orders
					are not to wash ourselves or run any water, to be quiet, to be dressed by eight
					and not to go to the bathroom," and as usual we followed these to the letter.
					We were all glad we'd slept so well and hadn't heard anything. For a while we
					were indignant because no one from the office came upstairs the entire morning;
					Mr. Kleiman left us on tenterhooks until eleven-thirty. He told that the
					burglars had forced the outside door and the warehouse door with a crowbar, but
					when they didn't find anything worth stealing, they tried their luck on the
					next floor. They stole two cashboxes containing 40 guilders, blank checkbooks
					and, worst of all, coupons for 330 pounds of sugar, our entire allotment. It
					won't be easy to wangle new ones.

					Mr. Kugler thinks this burglar belongs to the same gang as the one who made an

					North Amsterdam was very heavily bombed on Sunday. There was apparently a great

					them to dig out all the bodies. So far there have been two hundred dead and
					countless wounded; the hospitals are bursting at the seams. We've been told of

			-
				-
					Yesterday was a very tumultuous day, and we're still all wound up. Actually,
					you may wonder if there's ever a day that passes without some kind of
					excitement.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The first warning siren went off in the morning while we were at breakfast, but
					we paid no attention, because it only meant that the planes were crossing the
					coast. I had a terrible headache, so I lay down for an hour after breakfast and
					then went to the office at around two.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					At two-thirty Margot had finished her office work and was just gathering her
					things together when the sirens began wailing again. So she and I trooped back
					upstairs. None too soon, it seems, for less than five minutes later the guns
					were booming so loudly that we went and stood in the hall. The house shook and
					the bombs kept falling. I was clutching my "escape bag," more because I wanted
					to have something to hold on to than because I wanted to run away. I know we
					can't leave here, but if we had to, being seen on the streets would be just as
					dangerous as getting caught in an air raid. After half an hour the drone of
					engines faded and the house began to hum with activity again. Peter emerged
					from his lookout post in the front attic, Dussel remained in the front office,
					Mrs. van D. felt safest in the private office, Mr. van Daan had been watching
					from the loft, and those of us on the landing spread out to watch the columns
					of smoke rising from the harbor. Before long the smell of fire was everywhere,
					and outside it looked as if the city were enveloped in a thick fog.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					A big fire like that is not a pleasant sight, but fortunately for us it was all
					over, and we went baCk to our various chores. Just as we were starting dinner:
					another air-raid alarm. The food was good, but I lost my appetite the moment I
					heard the siren. Nothing happened, however, and forty-five minutes later the
					all clear was sounded. After the dishes had been washed: another air-raid
					warning, gunfire and swarms of planes. "Oh, gosh, twice in one day," we
					thought, "that's twice in one day," we thought, "that's twice too many." Little
					good that did us, because once agai the bombs rained down, this time on the
					others of the city. According to British reports, Schiphol Airport was bombed.
					The planes dived and climbed, the air was abuzz with the drone of engines. It
					was very scary, and the whole time I kept thinking, "Here it comes, this is
					it."
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I can assure you that when I went to bed at nine, my legs were still shaking.
					At the stroke of midnight I woke up again: more planes! Dussel was undressing,
					but I took no notice and leapt up, wide awake, at the sound of the first shot.
					I stayed in Father's bed until one, in my own bed until one-thirty, and was
					back in Father's bed at two. But the planes kept on coming. At last they
					stopped firing and I was able to go back "home" again. I finally fell asleep at
					half past two.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Seven o'clock. I awoke with a start and sat up in bed. Mr. van Daan was with
					Father. My first thought was: burglars. "Everything," I heard Mr. van Daan say,
					and I thought everything had been stolen. But no, this time it was wonderful
					news, the best we've had in months, maybe even since the war began. Mussolini
					has resigned and the King of Italy has taken over the government.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					We jumped for joy. After the awful events of yesterday, finally something good
					happens and brings us. . . hope! Hope for an end to the war, hope for peace.
				-
			-
				Entry 69 - MONDAY, JULY 26, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Mr. Kugler dropped by and told us that the Fokker aircraft factory had been hit
					hard. Meanwhile, there was another air-raid alarm this morning, with planes
					flying over, and another warning siren. I've had it up to here with alarms.
					I've hardly slept, and the last thing I want to do is work. But now the
					suspense about Italy and the hope that the war will be over by the end of the
					year are keeping us awake. .

				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan, Dussel and I were doing the dishes, and I was extremely quiet.
					This is very unusual for me and they were sure to notice, so in order to avoid
					any questions, I quickly racked my brains for a neutral topic. I thought the
					book Henry from Across the Street might fit the bill, but I couldn't have been
					more wrong; if Mrs. van Daan doesn't jump down my throat, Mr. Dussel does. It
					all boiled down to this: Mr. Dussel had recommended the book to Margot and me
					as an example of excellent writing. We thought it was anything but that. The
					little boy had been portrayed well, but as for the rest. . . the less said the
					better. I mentioned something to that effect while we were doing the dishes,
					and Dussel launched into a veritable tirade.
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					"How can you possibly understand the psychology of a man? That of a child isn't
					so difficult [!]. But you're far too young to read a book like that. Even a
					twenty-year-old man would be unable to comprehend it." (So why did he go out of
					his way to recommend it to Margot and me?)
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. and Dussel continued their harangue: "You know way too much about
					things you're not supposed to. You've been brought up all wrong. Later on, when
					you're older, you won't be able to enjoy anything anymore. You'll say, 'Oh, I
					read that twenty years ago in some book.' You'd better hurry if you want to
					catch a husband or fall in love, since everything is bound to be a
					disappointment to you. You already know all there is to know in theory. But in
					practice? That's another story!"
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Can you imagine how I felt? I astonished myself by calmly replying, "You may
					think I haven't been raised properly, but many people would disagree!"
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					They apparently believe that good child-rearing includes trying to pit me
					against my parents, since that's all they ever do. And not telling a girl my
					age about grown-up subjects is fine. We can all see what happens when, people
					are raised that way.
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 7

				-
					At that moment I could have slapped them both for poking fun at me. I was
					beside myself with rage, and if I only knew how much longer we had to put up
					with each other's company, I'd start counting the days.
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan's a fine one to talk! She sets an example all right — a bad one!
					She's known to be exceedingly pushy, egotistical, cunning, calculating and
					perpetually dissatisfied. Add to that, vanity and coquettishness and there's no
					question about it: she's a thoroughly despicable person. I could write an
					entire book about Madame van Daan, and who knows, maybe someday I will. Anyone
					can put on a charming exterior when they want to. Mrs. van D. is friendly to
					strangers, especially men, so it's easy to make a mistake when you first get to
					know her.
				-
			-
				Entry 70 - THURSDAY, JULY 29, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Mother thinks that Mrs. van D. is too stupid for words, Margot that she's too
					unimportant, Pirn that she's too ugly (literally and figuratively!), and after
					long observation (I'm never prejudiced at the beginning), I've come to the
					conclusion that she's all three of the above, and lots more besides. She has so
					many bad traits, why should I single out just one of them?

					us all very jittery; we're forever imagining a bite on our arms and legs or
					other parts of our bodies, so we leap up and do a few exercises, since it gives
					us an excuse to take a better look at our arms or necks. But now we're paying
					the price for having had so little physical exercise; we're so stiff we can
					hardly turn our heads. The real calisthenics fell by the wayside long ago.

					Now that we've been in hiding for a little over a year, you know a great deal
					about our lives. Still, I can't possibly tell you everything, since it's all so
					different compared to ordinary times and ordinary people. Nevertheless, to give
					you a closer look into our lives, from time to time I'll describe part of an
					ordinary day. I'll start with the evening and night.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Nine in the evening. Bedtime always begins in the Annex with an enormous hustle
					and bustle. Chairs are shifted, beds pulled out, blankets unfolded — nothing
					stays where it is during the daytime. I sleep on a small divan, which is only
					five feet long, so we have to add a few chairs to make it longer. Comforter,
					sheets, pillows, blankets: everything has to be removed from Dussel' s bed,
					where it's kept during the day.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					In the next room there's a terrible creaking: that's Margot's folding bed being
					set up. More blankets and pillows, anything to make the wooden slats a bit more
					comfortable. Upstairs it sounds like thunder, but it's only Mrs. van D.'s bed
					being shoved against the window so that Her Majesty, arrayed in her pink bed
					jacket, can sniff the night air through her delicate little nostrils.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Nine o'clock. After Peter's finished, it's my turn for the bathroom. I wash
					myself from head to toe, and more often than not I find a tiny flea floating in
					the sink (only during the hot months, weeks or days). I brush my teeth, curl my
					hair, manicure my nails and dab peroxide on my upper lip to bleach the black
					hairs — all this in less than half an hour.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Nine-thirty. I throw on my bathrobe. With soap in one hand, and potty,
					hairpins, panties, curlers and a wad of cotton in the other, I hurry out of the
					bathroom. The next in line invariably calls me back to remove the gracefully
					curved but unsightly hairs that I've left in the sink.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Ten o'clock. Time to put up the blackout screen and say good-night. For the
					next fifteen minutes, at least, the house is filled with the creaking of beds
					and the sigh of broken springs, and then, provided our upstairs neighbors
					aren't having a marital spat in bed, all is quiet.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Eleven— thirty. The bathroom door creaks. A narrow strip of light falls into
					the room. Squeaking shoes, a large coat, even larger than the man inside it . .
					. Dussel is returning from his nightly work in Mr. Kugler's office. I hear him
					shuffiing back and forth for ten whole minutes, the rustle of paper (from the
					food he's tucking away in his cupboard) and the bed being made up. Then the
					figure disappears again, and the only sound is the occasional suspicious noise
					from the bathroom.
				-
			-
				Entry 72 - WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4,1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Approximately three o'clock. I have to get up to use the tin can under my bed,
					which, to be on the safe side, has a rubber mat underneath in case of leaks. I
					always hold my breath while I go, since it clatters into the can like a brook
					down a mountainside. The potty is returned to its place, and the figure in the
					white nightgown (the one that causes Margot to exclaim every evening, "Oh, that
					indecent nighty!") climbs back into bed. A certain somebody lies awake for
					about fifteen minutes, listening to the sounds of the night. In the first
					place, to hear whether there are any burglars downstairs, and then to the
					various beds — upstairs, next door and in my room — to tell whether the others
					are asleep or half awake. This is no fun, especially when it concerns a member
					of the family named Dr. Dussel. First, there's the sound of a fish gasping for
					air, and this is repeated nine or ten times. Then, the lips are moistened
					profusely. This is alternated with little smacking sounds, followed by a long
					period of tossing and turning and rearranging the pillows. After five minutes
					of perfect quiet, the same sequence repeats itself three more times, after
					which he's presumably lulled himself back to sleep for a while.

					Sometimes the guns go off during the night, between one and four. I'm never
					aware of it before it happens, but all of a sudden I find myself standing
					beside my bed, out of sheer habit. Occasionally I'm dreaming so deeply (of
					irregular French verbs or a quarrel upstairs) that I realize only when my dream
					is over that the shooting has stopped and that I've remained quietly in my
					room. But usually I wake up. Then I grab a pillow and a handkerchief, throw on
					my robe and slippers and dash next door to Father, just the way Margot
					described in this birthday poem:

				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Upstairs you can hear the thud of the vacuum cleaner on Mrs. van D.'s beautiful
					and only rug. Margot tucks a few books under her arm and heads for the class
					for "slow learners," which is what Dussel seems to be. Pirn goes and sits in a
					corner with his constant companion, Dickens, in hopes of finding a bit of peace
					and quiet. Mother hastens upstairs to help the busy little housewife, and I
					tidy up both the bathroom and myself at the same time.
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Twelve forty— five. One by one they trickle in: first Mr. Gies and then either
					Mr. Kleiman
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					or Mr. Kugler, followed by Bep and sometimes even Miep.
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					One. Clustered around the radio, they all listen raptly to the BBC. This is the
					only time the members of the Annex family don't interrupt each other, since
					even Mr. van Daan can't argue with the speaker.
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					One-fifteen. Food distribution. Everyone from downstairs gets a cup of soup,
					plus dessert, if there happens to be any. A contented Mr. Gies sits on the
					divan or leans against the desk with his newspaper, cup and usually the cat at
					his side. If one of the three is missing, he doesn't hesitate to let his
					protest be heard. Mr. Kleiman relates the latest news from town, and he's an
					excellent source. Mr. Kugler hurries up the stairs, gives a short but solid
					knock on the door and comes in either wringing his hands or rubbing them in
					glee, depending on whether he's quiet and in a bad mood or talkative and in a
					good mood.
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					One forty-five. Everyone rises from the table and goes about their business.
					Margot and Mother do the dishes, Mr. and Mrs. van D. head for the divan, Peter
					for the attic, Father for his divan, Dussel too, and Anne does her homework.
				-
			-
				Entry 73 - THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					What comes next is the quietest hour of the day; when they're all asleep, there
					are no disturbances. To judge by his face, Dussel is dreaming of food. But I
					don't look at him long, because the time whizzes by and before you know it,
					it'll be 4 P.M. and the pedantic Dr. Dussel will be standing with the clock in
					his hand because I'm one minute date clearing off the table.

				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					We now continue with a typical day in the Annex. Since we've already had lunch,
					it's time to describe dinner.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan. Is served first, and takes a generous portion of whatever he
					likes. Usually joins in the conversation, never fails to give his opinion. Once
					he's spoken, his word is final. If anyone dares to suggest otherwise, Mr. van
					D. can put up a good fight. Oh, he can hiss like a cat. . . but I'd rather he
					didn't. Once you've seen it, you never want to see it again. His opinion is the
					best, he knows the most about everything. Granted, the man has a good head on
					his shoulders, but it's swelled to no small degree.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Madame. Actually, the best thing would be to say nothing. Some days, especially
					when a foul mood is on the way, her face is hard to read. If you analyze the
					discussions, you realize she's not the subject, but the guilty party! A fact
					everyone prefers to ignore. Even so, you could call her the instigator.
					Stirring up trouble, now that's what Mrs. van Daan calls fun. Stirring up
					trouble between Mrs. Frank and Anne. Margot and Mr. Frank aren t qwte as easy.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					But let's return to the table. Mrs. van D. may think she doesn't always get
					enough, but that's not the case. The choicest potatoes, the tastiest morsel,
					the tenderest bit of whatever there is, that's Madame's motto. The others can
					all have their turn, as long as I get the best. (Exactly what she accuses Anne
					Frank of doing.) Her second watchword is: keep talking. As long as somebody's
					listening, it doesn't seem to occur to her to wonder whether they're
					interested. She must think that whatever Mrs. van Daan says will interest
					everyone.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Smile coquettishly, pretend you know everything, offer everyone a piece of
					advice and mother them — that's sure to make a good impression. But if you take
					a better look, the good impression fades. One, she's hardworking; two,
					cheerful; three, coquettish — and sometimes a cute face. That's Petronella van
					Daan.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The third diner. Says very little. Young Mr. van Daan is usually quiet and
					hardly makes his presence known. As far as his appetite is concerned, he's a
					Danaldean vessel that never gets full. Even after the most substantial meal, he
					can look you calmly in the eye and claim he could have eaten twice as much.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Number four — Margot. Eats like a bird and doesn't talk at all. She eats only
					vegetables and fruit. "Spoiled," in the opinion of the van Daans. "Too little
					exercise and fresh air," in ours.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Beside her — Mama. Has a hearty appetite, does her share of the talking. No one
					has the impression, as they do with Mrs. van Daan, that this is a housewife.
					What's the difference between the two? Well, Mrs. van D. does the cooking and
					Mother does the dishes and polishes the furniture.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Numbers six and seven. I won't say much about Father and me. The former is the
					most modest person at the table. He always looks to see whether the others have
					been served first. He needs nothing for himself; the best things are for the
					children. He's goodness personified. Seated next to him is the Annex's little
					bundle of nerves.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Dussel. Help yourself, keep your eyes on the food, eat and don't talk. And if
					you have to say something, then for goodness' sake talk about food. That
					doesn't lead to quarrels, just to bragging. He consumes enormous portions, and
					"no" is not part of his vocabulary, whether the food is good or bad.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Pants that come up to his chest, a red jacket, black patent-leather slippers
					and horn-rimmed glasses — that's how he looks when he's at work at the little
					table, always studying and never progressing. This is interrupted only by his
					afternoon nap, food and — his favorite spot — the bathroom. Three, four or five
					times a day there's bound to be someone waiting outside the bathroom door,
					hopping impatiently from one foot to another, trying to hold it in and barely
					managing. Does Dussel care? Not a whit. From seven— fifteen to seven— thirty,
					from twelve — thirty to one, from two to two — fifteen, from four to four —
					fifteen, from six to six — fifteen, from eleven — thirty to twelve. You can set
					your watch by them; these are the times for his "regular sessions." He never
					deviates or lets himself be swayed by the voices outside the door, begging him
					to open up before a disaster occurs.
				-
			-
				Entry 75 - MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1943: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Number nine is not part of our Annex family, although she does share our house
					and table. Hep has a healthy appetite. She cleans her plate and isn't choosy.
					Hep's easy to please and that pleases us. She can be characterized as follows:
					cheerful, good-humored, kind and willing.

				Entry 76 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					A new idea: during meals I talk more to myself than to the others, which has
					two advantages. First, they're glad they don't have to listen to my continuous
					chatter, and second, I don't have to get annoyed by their opinions. I don't
					think my opinions are stupid but other people do, so it's better to keep them
					to myself. I apply the same tactic when I have to eat something I loathe. I put
					the dish in front of me, pretend it's delicious, avoid looking at it as much as
					possible, and it's gone before I've had time to realize what it is. When I get
					up in the morning, another very disagreeable moment, I leap out of bed, think
					to myself, "You'll be slipping back under the covers soon," walk to the window,
					take down the blackout screen, sniff at the crack until I feel a bit of fresh
					air, and I'm awake. I strip the bed as fast as I can so I won't be tempted to
					get back in. Do you know what Mother calls this sort of thing? The art of
					living. Isn't that a funny expression?
				-
			-
				Entry 76 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					We've all been a little confused this past week because our dearly beloved
					Westertoren bells have been carted off to be melted down for the war, so we
					have no idea of the exact time, either night or day. I still have hopes that
					they'll come up with a substitute, made of tin or copper or some such thing, to
					remind the neighborhood of the clock.
				-
			-
				Entry 76 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Everywhere I go, upstairs or down, they all cast admiring glances at my feet,
					which are adorned by a pair of exceptionally beautiful (for times like these!)
					shoes. Miep managed to snap them up for 27.50 guilders. Burgundy-colored suede
					and leather with medium-sized high heels. I feel as if I were on stilts, and
					look even taller than I already am.
				-
			-
				Entry 76 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Yesterday was my unlucky day. I pricked my right thumb with the blunt end of a
					big needle. As a result, Margot had to peel potatoes for me (take the good with
					the bad), and writing was awkward. Then I bumped into the cupboard door so hard
					it nearly knocked me over, and was scolded for making such a racket. They
					wouldn't let me run water to bathe my forehead, so now I'm walking around with
					a giant lump over my right eye. To make matters worse, the little toe on my
					right foot got stuck in the vacuum cleaner. It bled and hurt, but my other
					ailments were already causing me so much trouble that I let this one slide,
					which was stupid of me, because now I'm walking around with an infected toe.
					What with the salve, the gauze and the tape, I can't get my heavenly new shoe
					on my foot.
				-
			-
				Entry 76 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Dussel has put us in danger for the umpteenth time. He actually had Miep bring
					him a book, an anti-Mussolini tirade, which has been banned. On the way here
					she was knocked down by an SS motorcycle. She lost her head and shouted "You
					brutes!" and went on her way. I don't dare think what would have happened if
					she'd been taken down to headquarters.

					A Daily Chore in Our Little Community: Peeling Potatoes!
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					One person goes to get some newspapers! another, the knives (keeping the best
					for himself, of course); the third, the potatoes; and the fourth, the water.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Mr. Dussel begins. He may not always peel them very well, but he does peel
					nonstop, glancing left and right to see if everyone is doing it the way he
					does. No, they're not!
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 4
			-
				-

				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					We go on peeling. I glance at Dussel out of the corner of my eye. Lost in
					thought, he shakes his head (over me, no doubt), but says no more.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I keep on peeling. Then I look at Father, on the other side of me. To Father,
					peeling potatoes is not a chore, but precision work. When he reads, he has a
					deep wrinkle in the back of his head. But when he's preparing potatoes, beans
					or vegetables, he seems to be totally absorbed in his task. Fie puts on his
					potato-peeling face, and when it's set in that particular way, it would be
					impossible for him to turn out anything less than a perfectly peeled potato.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I keep on working. I glance up for a second, but that's all the time I need.
					Mrs. van D. is trying to attract Dussel's attention. She starts by looking in
					his direction, but Dussel pretends not to notice. She winks, but Dussel goes on
					peeling. She laughs, but Dussel still doesn't look up. Then Mother laughs too,
					but Dussel pays them no mind. Having failed to achieve her goal, Mrs. van D. is
					obliged to change tactics. There's a brief silence. Then she says, "Putti, why
					don't you put on an apron? Otherwise, I'll have to spend all day tomorrow
					trying to get the spots out of your suit!"
				-

					Five-thirty. Bep's arrival signals the beginning of our nightly freedom. Things
					get going right away. I go upstairs with Bep, who usually has her dessert
					before the rest of us. The moment she sits down, Mrs. van D. begins stating her
					wishes. Her list usually starts with "Oh, by the way, Bep, something else I'd
					like. . ." Bep winks at me. Mrs. van D. doesn't miss a chance to make her
					wishes known to whoever comes upstairs. It must be one of the reasons none of
					them like to go up there.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 34

					Five forty-five. Bep leaves. I go down two floors to have a look around: first

					After a long tour of inspection, I wind up in Mr. Kugler's office. Mr. van Daan

					warehouse key; Pirn lugs the typewriters upstairs; Margot looks around for a
					quiet place to do her office work; Mrs. van D. puts a kettle of water on the

					jobs.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 37
			-
				-
					Soon Peter comes back from the warehouse. The first question they ask him is
					whether he's remembered the bread. No, he hasn't. He crouches before the door
					to the front office to make himself as small as possible and crawls on his
					hands and knees to the steel cabinet, takes out the bread and starts to leave.
					At any rate, that's what he intends to do, but before he knows what's happened,
					Mouschi has jumped over him and gone to sit under the desk.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 38
			-
				-
					Peter looks all around him. Aha, there's the cat! He crawls back into the
					office and grabs the cat by the tail. Mouschi hisses, Peter sighs. What has he
					accomplished? Mouschi's now sitting by the window licking herself, very pleased
					at having escaped Peter's clutches. Peter has no choice but to lure her with a
					piece of bread. Mouschi takes the bait, follows him out, and the door closes.

			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 40
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan is angry and slams the door. Margot and I exchange looks and think
					the same thing: he must have worked himself into a rage again because of some
					blunder on Mr. Kugler's part, and he's forgotten all about the Keg Company next
					door.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 41
			-
				-
					Another step is heard in the hallway. Dussel comes in, goes toward the window
					with an air of propriety, sniffs. . . coughs, sneezes and clears his throat.
					He's out of luck — it was pepper. He continues on to the front office. The
					curtains are open, which means he can't get at his writing paper. He disappears
					with a scowl.
				-
			-
				Entry 77 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 42

					Margot and I exchange another glance. "One less page for his sweetheart
					tomorrow," I hear her say. I nod in agreement.

					Come here, you can't run the water anymore. Walk softly!" A sample of what's

				Entry 78 - MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The ideal family scene has now reached its high point. I want to read or study
					and Margot does too. Father and Mother ditto. Father is sitting (with Dickens
					and the dictionary, of course) on the edge of the sagging, squeaky bed, which
					doesn't even have a decent mattress. Two bolsters can be piled on top of each
					other. "I don't need these," he thinks. "I can manage without them!"

					Mother sits on the folding bed, either reading, sewing, knitting or studying,

					reappearing I at the back of his head, and he buries himself in his book 1
					again; Mother starts chatting with Margot; and I get curious and listen too.
					Pirn is drawn into the conversation . . . Nine o'clock. Breakfast!

					Every time I write to you, something special has happened, usually unpleasant

				-
			-
				Entry 79 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					On Wednesday, September 8, we were listening to the seven o'clock news when we
					heard an announcement: "Here is some of the best news of the war so far: Italy
					has capitulated." Italy has unconditionally surrendered! The Dutch broadcast
					from England began at eight-fifteen with the news: "Listeners, an hour and
					fifteen minutes ago, just as I finished writing my daily report, we received
					the wonderful news of Italy's capitulation. I tell you, I never tossed my notes
					into the wastepaper basket with more delight than I did today!"

				Entry 79 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1943: Paragraph 4

					"God Save the King," the American national anthem and the Russian'

				Entry 79 - FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					The British have landed in Naples. Northern Italy is occupied by the Germans.
					The truce was signed on Friday, September 3, the day the British landed in
					Italy. The Germans are ranting and raving in all the newspapers at the
					treachery of Badoglio and the Italian king.

				-
					Still, there's bad news as well. It's about Mr. Kleiman. As you know, we all
					like him very much. He's unfailingly cheerful and amazingly brave, despite the
					fact that he's always sick and in pain and can't eat much or do a lot of
					walking. "When Mr. Kleiman enters a room, the sun begins to shine," Mother said
					recently, and she's absolutely right.

					Now it seems he has to go to the hospital for a very difficult operation on his

					seen him when he told us good-bye. He acted so normally, as though he were just
					off to do an errand.

				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Relationships here in the Annex are getting worse all the time. We don't dare
					open our mouths at mealtime (except to slip in a bite of food), because no
					matter what we say, someone is bound to resent it or take it the wrong way. Mr.
					Voskuijl occasionally comes to visit us. Unfortunately, he's not doing very
					well. He isn't making it any easier for his family, because his attitude seems
					to be: what do I care, I'm going to die anyway! When I think how touchy
					everyone is here, I can just imagine what it must be like at the Voskuijls'.
				-
			-
				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I've been taking valerian every day to fight the anxiety and depression, but it
					doesn't stop me from being even more miserable the next day. A good hearty
					laugh would help better than ten valerian drops, but we've almost forgotten how
					to laugh. Sometimes I'm afraid my face is going to sag with all this sorrow and
					that my mouth is going to permanently droop at the corners. The others aren't
					doing any better. Everyone here is dreading the great terror known as winter.
				-
			-
				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Another fact that doesn't exactly brighten up our days is that Mr. van Maaren,
					the man who works in the warehouse, is getting suspicious about the Annex. A
					person with any brains must have noticed by now that Miep sometimes says she's
					going to the lab, Bep to the file room and Mr. Kleiman to the Opekta supplies,
					while Mr. Kugler claims the Annex doesn't belong to this building at all, but
					to the one next door.
				-
			-
				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					We wouldn't care what Mr. van Maaren thought of the situation except that he's
					known to be unreliable and to possess a high degree of curiosity. He's not one
					who can be put off with a flimsy excuse.
				-
			-
				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					One day Mr. Kugler wanted to be extra cautious, so at twenty past twelve he put
					on his coat and went to the drugstore around the corner. Less than five minutes
					later he was back, and he sneaked up the stairs like a thief to visit us. At
					one-fifteen he started to leave, but Bep met him on the landing and warned him
					that van Maaren was in the office. Mr. Kugler did an about-face and stayed with
					us until one-thirty. Then he took off his shoes and went in his stockinged feet
					(despite his cold) to the front attic and down the other stairway, taking one
					step at a time to avoid the creaks. It took him fifteen minutes to negotiate
					the stairs, but he wound up safely in the office after having entered from the
					outside.
				-
			-
				Entry 80 - THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					In the meantime, Bep had gotten rid of van Maaren and come to get Mr. Kugler
					from the Annex. But he'd already left and at that moment was still tiptoeing
					down the stairs. What must the passersby have thought when they saw the manager
					putting on his shoes outside? Hey, you there, in the socks!

				-
					It's Mrs. van Daan's birthday. Other than one ration stamp each for cheese,
					meat and bread, all she received from us was a jar of jam. Her husband, Dussel
					and the office staff gave her nothing but flowers and also food. Such are the
					times we live in!
				-
			-
				Entry 81 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Bep had a nervous fit last week because she had so many errands to do. Ten
					times a day people were sending her out for something, each time insisting she
					go right away or go again or that she'd done it all wrong. And when you think
					that she has her regular office work to do, that Mr. Kleiman is sick, that Miep
					is home with a cold and that Bep herself has a sprained ankle, boyfriend
					troubles and a grouchy father, it's no wonder she's at the end of her tether.
					We comforted her and told her that if she'd put her foot down once or twice and
					say she didn't have the time, the shopping lists would shrink of their own
					accord.
				-
			-
				Entry 81 - WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Saturday there was a big drama, the likes of which have never been seen here
					before. It started with a discussion of van Maaren and ended in a general
					argument and tears. Dussel complained to Mother that he was being treated like
					a leper, that no one was friendly to him and that, after all, he hadn't done
					anything to deserve it. This was followed by a lot of sweet talk, which luckily
					Mother didn't fall for this time. She told him we were disappointed in him and
					that, on more than one occasion, he'd been a source of great annoyance. Dussel
					promised her the moon, but, as usual, we haven't seen so much as a beam.

					There's trouble brewing with the van Daans, I can tell! Father's furious

					Oh, what kind of bombshell is about to burst now? If only I weren't so involved
					in all these skirmishes! If only I could leave here! They're driving us crazy!

			-
				-
					Mr. Kleiman is back, thank goodness! He looks a bit pale, and yet he cheerfully
					set off to sell some clothes for Mr. van Daan. The disagreeable fact is that
					Mr. van Daan has run out of money. He lost his last hundred guilders in the
					warehouse, which is still creating trouble for us: the men are wondering how a
					hundred guilders could wind up in the warehouse on a Monday morning. Suspicion
					abounds. Meanwhile, the hundred guilders have been stolen. Who's the thief?
				-
			-
				Entry 82 - SUNDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					But I was talking about the money shortage. Mrs. van D. has scads of dresses,
					coats and shoes, none of which she feels she can do without. Mr. van D.'s suit
					is difficult to sell, and Peter's bike was put on the block, but is back again,
					since nobody wanted it. But the story doesn't end there. You see, Mrs. van D.
					is going to have to part with her fur coat. In her opinion, the firm should pay
					for our upkeep, but that's ridiculous. They just had a flaming row about it and
					have entered the "oh, my sweet Putti" and "darling Kerli" stage of
					reconciliation.
				-
			-
				Entry 82 - SUNDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					My mind boggles at the profanity this honorable house has had to endure in the
					past month. Father walks around with his lips pressed together, and whenever he
					hears his name, he looks up in alarm, as ifhe's afraid he'll be called upon to
					resolve another delicate problem. Mother's so wrought up her cheeks are
					blotched with red, Margot complains of headaches, Dussel can't sleep, Mrs. van
					D. frets and fumes all day long, and I've gone completely round the bend. To
					tell you the truth, I sometimes forget who we're at odds with and who we're
					not. The only way to take my mind off it is to study, and I've been doing a lot
					of that lately.

			-
				-
					Mr. Kleiman is out again; his stomach won't give him a moment's peace. He
					doesn't even know whether it's stopped bleeding. He came to tell us he wasn't
					feeling well and was going home, and for the first time he seemed really down.
				-
			-
				Entry 83 - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29,1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Mr. and Mrs. van D. have had more raging battles. The reason is simple: they're
					broke. They wanted to sell an overcoat and a suit of Mr. van D. 's, but were
					unable to find any buyers. His prices were way too high.
				-
			-
				Entry 83 - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29,1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Some time ago Mr. Kleiman was talking about a furrier he knows. This gave Mr.
					van D. the idea of selling his wife's fur coat. It's made of rabbit skin, and
					she's had it for seventeen years. Mrs. van D. got 325 guilders for it, an
					enormous amount. She wanted to keep the money herself to buy new clothes after
					the war, and it took some doing before Mr. van D. could make her understand
					that it was desperately needed to cover household expenses.
				-
			-
				Entry 83 - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29,1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					You can't imagine the screaming, shouting, stamping of feet and swearing that
					went on. It was terrifying. My family stood holding its breath at the bottom of
					the stairs, in case it might be necessary to drag them apart. All the
					bickering, tears and nervous tension have become such a stress and strain that
					I fall into my bed at night crying and thanking my lucky stars that I have half
					an hour to myself.
				-
			-
				Entry 83 - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29,1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I'm doing fine, except I've got no appetite. I keep hearing: "Goodness, you
					look awful!" I must admit they're doing their best to keep me in condition:
					they're plying me with dextrose, cod-liver oil, brewer's yeast and calcium. My
					nerves often get the better of me, especially on Sundays: that's when I really
					feel miserable. The atmosphere is stifling, sluggish, leaden. Outside, you
					don't hear a single bird, and a deathly, oppressive silence hangs over the
					house and clings to me as if it were going to drag me into the deepest regions
					of the underworld. At times like these, Father, Mother and Margot don't matter
					to me in the least. I wander from room to room, climb up and down the stairs
					and feel like a songbird whose wings have been ripped off and who keeps hurling
					itself against the bars of its dark cage. "Let me out, where there's fresh air
					and laughter!" a voice within me cries. I don't even bother to reply anymore,
					but lie down on the divan. Sleep makes the silence and the terrible fear go by
					more quickly, helps pass the time, since it's impossible to kill it.

					To take our minds off matters as well as to develop them, Father ordered a
					catalog from a correspondence school. Margot pored through the thick brochure
					three times without finding anything to her liking and within her budget.
					Father was easier to satisfy and decided to write and ask for a trial lesson in
					"Elementary Latin." No sooner said than done. The lesson arrived, Margot set to
					work enthusiastically and decided to take the course, despite the expense. It's
					much too hard for me, though I'd really like to learn Latin.
				-

				Entry 84 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1943: Paragraph 3

					Since the vacuum cleaner's broken, I have to take an old brush to the rug every
					night. The window's closed, the light's on, the stove's burning, and there I am
					brushing away at the rug. "That's sure to be a problem," I thought to myself
					the first time. "There're bound to be complaints." I was right: Mother got a
					headache from the thick clouds of dust whirling around the room, Margot's new
					Latin dictionary was caked with dirt, and rim grumbled that the floor didn't
					look any different anyway. Small thanks for my pains.

					We've decided that from now on the stove is going to be lit at seven-thirty on

				Entry 84 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1943: Paragraph 8

					It's the same with the curtains. Ever since we first went into hiding, they've
					been tacked firmly to the windows. Sometimes one of the ladies or gentlemen
					can't resist the urge to peek outside. The result: a storm of reproaches. The
					response: "Oh, nobody will notice." That's how every act of carelessness begins
					and ends. No one will notice, no one will hear, no one will pay the least bit
					of attention. Easy to say, but is it true?

					At the moment, the tempestuous quarrels have subsided; only Dussel and the van

					If you were to read all my letters in one sitting, you'd be struck by the fact
					that they were written in a variety of moods. It annoys me to be so dependent
					on the moods here in the Annex, but I'm not the only one: we're all subject to
					them. If I'm engrossed in a book, I have to rearrange my thoughts before I can
					mingle with other people, because otherwise they might think I was strange. As
					you can see, I'm currently in the middle of a depression. I couldn't really
					tell you what set it off, but I think it stems from my cowardice, which
					confronts me at every turn. This evening, when Bep was still here, the doorbell
					rang long and loud. I instantly turned white, my stomach churned, and my heart
					beat wildly — and all because I was afraid.
				-

				Entry 85 - MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 8,1943: Paragraph 3

				-
					At night in bed I see myself alone in a dungeon, without Father and Mother. Or

					everything as if it were actually taking place. And to think it might all

					standing is still safe, but the clouds are moving in on us, and the ring
					between us and the approaching danger is being pulled tighter and tighter.
					We're surrounded by darkness and danger, and in our desperate search for a way
					out we keep bumping into each other. We look at the fighting down below and the
					peace and beauty up above. In the meantime, we've been cut off by the dark mass
					of clouds, so that we can go neither up nor down. It looms before us like an
					impenetrable wall, trying to crush us, but not yet able to. I can only cry out
					and implore, "Oh, ring, ring, open wide and let us out!"

				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					My fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions; I valued it
					highly, especially because it had a thick nib, and I can only write neatly with
					thick nibs. It has led a long and interesting fountain-pen life, which I will
					summarize below.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					When I was nine, my fountain pen (packed in cotton) arrived as a "sample of no
					commercial value" all the way from Aachen, where my grandmother (the kindly
					donor) used to live. I lay in bed with the flu, while the February winds howled
					around the apartment house. This splendid fountain pen came in a red leather
					case, and I showed it to my girlfriends the first chance I got. Me, Anne Frank,
					the proud owner of a fountain pen.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					When I was ten, I was allowed to take the pen to school, and to my surprise,
					the teacher even let me write with it. When I was eleven, however, my treasure
					had to be tucked away again, because my sixth-grade teacher allowed us to use
					only school pens and inkpots. When I was twelve, I started at the Jewish Fyceum
					and my fountain pen was given a new case in honor of the occasion. Not only did
					it have room for a pencil, it also had a zipper, which was much more
					impressive. When I was thirteen, the fountain pen went with me to the Annex,
					and together we've raced through countless diaries and compositions. I'd turned
					fourteen and my fountain pen was enjoying the last year of its life with me
					when . . .
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					It was just after five on Friday afternoon. I came out of my room and was about
					to sit down at the table to write when I was roughly pushed to one side to make
					room for Margot and Father, who wanted to practice their Latin. The fountain
					pen remained unused on the table, while its owner, sighing, was forced to make
					do with a very tiny corner of the table, where she began rubbing beans. That's
					how we remove mold from the beans and restore them to their original state. At
					a quarter to six I swept the floor, dumped the dirt into a news paper, along
					with the rotten beans, and tossed it into the stove. A giant flame shot up, and
					I thought it was wonderful that the stove, which had been gasping its last
					breath, had made such a miraculous recovery.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					All was quiet again. The Latin students had left, and I sat down at the table
					to pick up where I'd left off. But no matter where I looked, my fountain pen
					was nowhere in sight. I took another look. Margot looked, Mother looked, Father
					looked, Dussel looked. But it had vanished.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-

					"Maybe it fell in the stove, along with the beans!" Margot suggested.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					"No, it couldn't have!" I replied.
				-
			-
				Entry 86 - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1943: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					But that evening, when my fountain pen still hadn't turned up, we all assumed
					it had been burned, especially because celluloid is highly inflammable. Our
					darkest fears were confirmed the next day when Father went to empty the stove
					and discovered the clip, used to fasten it to a pocket, among the ashes. Not a
					trace of the gold nib was left. "It must have melted into stone," Father
					conjectured.

				Entry 87 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Recent events have the house rocking on its foundations. Owing to an outbreak
					of diphtheria at Bep's, she won't be allowed to come in contact with us for six
					weeks. Without her, the cooking and shopping will be very difficult, not to
					mention how much we'll miss her company. Mr. Kleiman is still in bed and has
					eaten nothing but gruel for three weeks. Mr. Kugler is up to his neck in work.

			-
				-
					Margot sends her Latin lessons to a teacher, who corrects and then returns

					too. I bet he's glad to have such a smart student.

				Entry 87 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Dussel is in a turmoil and we don't know why. It all began with Dussel's saying
					nothing when he was upstairs; he didn't exchange so much as a word with either
					Mr. or Mrs. van Daan. We all noticed it. This went on for a few days, and then
					Mother took the opportunity to warn him about Mrs. van D., who could make life
					miserable for him. Dussel said Mr. van Daan had started the silent treatment
					and he had no intention of breaking it. I should explain that yesterday was
					November 16, the first anniversary of his living in the Annex. Mother received
					a plant in honor of the occasion, but Mrs. van Daan, who had alluded to the
					date for weeks and made no

			-
				Entry 87 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					bones about the fact that she thought Dussel should treat us to dinner,
					received nothing. Instead of making use of the opportunity to thank us — for
					the first time — for unselfishly taking him in, he didn't utter a word. And on
					the morning of the sixteenth, when I asked him whether I should offer him my
					congratulations or my condolences, he replied that either one would do. Mother,
					having cast herself in the role of peacemaker, made no headway whatsoever, and
					the situation finally ended in a draw.
				-
			-
				Entry 87 - WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I can say without exaggeration that Dussel has definitely got a screw loose. We
					often laugh to ourselves because he has no memory, no fixed opinions and no
					common sense. He's amused us more than once by trying to pass on the news he's
					just heard, since the message invariably gets garbled in transmission.
					Furthermore, he answers every reproach or accusation with a load of fine 1\
					promises, which he never manages to keep.

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Last night, just as I was falling asleep, Hanneli suddenly appeared before me.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I saw her there, dressed in rags, her face thin and worn. She looked at me with
					such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes that I could read the message in
					them: "Oh, Anne, why have you deserted me? Help me, help me, rescue me from
					this hell!"
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					And I can't help her. I can only stand by and watch while other people suffer
					and die. All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us. I saw Hanneli,
					and no one else, and I understood why. I misjudged her, wasn't mature enough to
					understand how difficult it was for her. She was devoted to her girlfriend, and
					it must have seemed as though I were trying to take her away. The poor thing,
					she must have felt awful! I know, because I recognize the feeling in myself! I
					had an occasional flash of understanding, but then got selfishly wrapped up
					again in my own problems and pleasures.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					It was mean of me to treat her that way, and now she was looking at me, oh so
					helplessly, with her pale face and beseeching eyes. If only I could help her!
					Dear God, I have everything I could wish for, while fate has her in its deadly
					clutches. She was as devout as I am, maybe even more so, and she too wanted to
					do what was right. But then why have I been chosen to live, while she's
					probably going to die? What's the difference between us? Why are we now so far
					apart?
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					To be honest, I hadn't thought of her for months — no, for at least a year. I
					hadn't forgotten her entirely, and yet it wasn't until I saw her before me that
					I thought of all her suffering.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Oh, Hanneli, I hope that if you live to the end of the war and return to us,
					I'll be able to take you in and make up for the wrong I've done you.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					But even if I were ever in a position to help, she wouldn't need it more than
					she does now. I wonder if she ever thinks of me, and what she's feeling?
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Merciful God, comfort her, so that at least she won't be alone. Oh, if only You
					could tell her I'm thinking of her with compassion and love, it might help her
					go on.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I've got to stop dwelling on this. It won't get me anywhere. I keep seeing her
					enormous eyes, and they haunt me. Does Hanneli really and truly believe in God,
					or has religion merely been foisted upon her? I don't even know that. I never
					took the trouble to ask.
				-
			-
				Entry 88 - SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1943: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Hanneli, Hanneli, if only I could take you away, if only I could share
					everything I have with you. It's too late. I can't help, or undo the wrong I've
					done. But I'll never forget her again and I'll always pray for her!

				-
			-
				Entry 89 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					More than anyone, I thought it would be terrible to skip a celebration this

					I consulted rim, and a week ago we set to work writing a verse for each person.
				-
			-
				Entry 89 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Sunday evening at a quarter to eight we trooped upstairs carrying the big
					laundry basket, which had been decorated with cutouts and bows made of pink and
					blue carbon paper. On top was a large piece of brown wrapping paper with a note
					attached. Everyone was rather amazed at the sheer size of the gift. I removed
					the note and read it aloud:

					Then we were hopeful, no reason to doubt

				Entry 89 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1943: Paragraph 10

					That optimism would win the bout,

				-
					And by the time this year came round,
				-

				-
					We'd all be free, and s* and sound.
				-
			-

					Still, let's not Jorget it's St. Nicholas Day,

			-

			-
				-
					Though we've nothing left to give away.
				-
			-
				Entry 89 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1943: Paragraph 15

					We'll have to find something else to do:

				-
			-
				Entry 89 - MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1943: Paragraph 17

					As each person took their own shoe out of the basket, there was a roar of
					laughter. Inside each shoe was a little wrapped package addressed to its owner.

					A bad case of flu has prevented me from writing to you until today. Being sick

					twice, three times — and try to keep from coughing anymore.
				-
			-
				Entry 90 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED]: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Most of the time the tickle refused to go away, so I had to drink milk with
					honey, sugar or cough drops. I get dizzy just thinking about all the cures I've
					been subjected to: sweating out the fever, steam treatment, wet compresses, dry
					compresses, hot drinks, swabbing my throat, lying still, heating pad, hot-water
					bottles, lemonade and, every two hours, the thermometer. Will these remedies
					really make you better? The worst part was when Mr. Dussel decided to play
					doctor and lay his pomaded head on my bare chest to listen to the sounds. Not
					only did his hair tickle, but I was embarrassed, even though he went to school
					thirty years ago and does have some kind of medical degree. Why should he lay
					his head on my heart? After all, he's not my boyfriend! For that matter, he
					wouldn't be able to tell a healthy sound from an unhealthy one.
				-
			-

					He'd have to have his ears cleaned first, since he's becoming alarmingly hard

					Dear Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					As I've written you many times before, moods have a tendency to affect us quite
					a bit here, and in my case it's been getting worse lately. "Himmelhoch
					jauchzend, zu Tode betru'bt"* [* A famous line from Goethe: "On top of the
					world, or in the depths of despair."] certainly applies to me. I'm "on top of
					the world" when I think of how fortunate we are and compare myself to other
					Jewish children, and "in the depths of despair" when, for example, Mrs. Kleiman
					comes by and talks about Jopie's hockey club, canoe trips, school plays and
					afternoon teas with friends.
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I don't think I'm jealous of Jopie, but I long to have a really good time for
					once and to laugh so hard it hurts.
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					We're stuck in this house like lepers, especially during winter and the
					Christmas and New Year's holidays. Actually, I shouldn't even be writing this,
					since it makes me seem so ungrateful, but I can't keep everything to myself, so
					I'll repeat what I said at the beginning: "Paper is more patient than people."
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Whenever someone comes in from outside, with the wind in their clothes and the
					cold on their cheeks, I feel like burying my head under the blankets to keep
					from thinking, "When will we be allowed to breathe fresh air again?" I can't do
					that — on the contrary, I have to hold my head up high and put a bold face on
					things, but the thoughts keep coming anyway. Not just once, but over and over.
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Believe me, if you've been shut up for a year and a half, it can get to be too
					much for you sometimes. But feelings can't be ignored, no matter how unjust or
					ungrateful they seem. I long to ride a bike, dance, whistle, look at the world,
					feel young and know that I'm free, and yet I can't let it show, just imagine
					what would happen if all eight of us were to feel sorry for ourselves or walk
					around with the discontent clearly visible on our faces. Where would that get
					us? I sometimes wonder if anyone will ever understand what I mean, if anyone
					will ever overlook my ingratitude and not worry about whether or not I'm Jewish
					and merely see me as a teenager badly in need of some good plain fun. I don't
					know, and I wouldn't be able to talk about it with anyone, since I'm sure I'd
					start to cry. Crying can bring relief, as long as you don't cry alone. Despite
					all my theories and efforts, I miss — every day and every hour of the day —
					having a mother who understands me. That's why with everything I do and write,
					I imagine the kind of mom I'd like to be to my children later on. The kind of
					mom who doesn't take everything people say too seriously, but who does take me
					seriously. I find it difficult to describe what I mean, but the word' 'mom"
					says it all. Do you know what I've come up with? In order to give me the
					feeling of calling my mother something that sounds like "Mom," I often call
					her" Momsy." Sometimes I shorten it to "Moms": an imperfect "Mom." I wish I
					could honor her by removing the "s." It's a good thing she doesn't realize
					this, since it would only make her unhappy.
				-
			-
				Entry 91 - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1943: Paragraph 7

					Well, that's enough of that. My writing has raised me somewhat from "the depths

					It's the day after Christmas, and I can't help thinking about Pirn and the

				-
			-
				Entry 92 - [SUNDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1943]: Paragraph 2

					I think Pim told me because he, who knows the "intimate secrets" of so many

					himself, and I don't think Margot has any inkling of what he's been through.
					Poor Pim, he can't fool me into thinking he's forgotten that girl. He never
					will. It's made him very accommodating, since he's not blind to Mother's
					faults. I hope I'm going to be a little like him, without having to go through

					Grandma, oh, my sweet Grandma. How little we understood what she suffered, how

					secret. * [*Anne's grandmother was terminally ill.]

					Grandma was always so loyal and good. She would never have let any of us down.
					Whatever happened, no matter how much I misbehaved, Grandma always stuck up for

					what goes on here?
				-

				Entry 94 - WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1943: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Shouldn't I be happy, contented and glad, except when I'm thinking of Hanneli
					and those suffering along with her? I'm selfish and cowardly. Why do I always
					think and dream the most awful things and want to scream in terror? Because, in
					spite of everything, I still don't have enough faith in God. He's given me so

					Since the last raging quarrels, things have settled down here, not only between
					ourselves, Dussel and "upstairs," but also between Mr. and Mrs. van D.
					Nevertheless, a few dark thunderclouds are heading this way, and all because of
					. . . food. Mrs. van D. came up with the ridiculous idea of frying fewer
					potatoes in the morning and saving them for later in the day. Mother and Dussel
					and the rest of us didn't agree with her, so now we're dividing up the potatoes
					as well. It seems the fats and oils aren't being doled out fairly, and Mother's
					going to have to put a stop to it. I'll let you know if there are any
					interesting developments. For the last few months now we've been splitting up
					the meat (theirs with fat, ours without), the soup (they eat it, we don't), the
					potatoes (theirs peeled, ours not), the extras and now the fried potatoes too.

					with so much anger and hate that I had to confide it all to you. I tried to
					understand the Anne of last year and make apologies for her, because as long as
					I leave you with these accusations and don't attempt to explain what prompted
					them, my conscience won't be clear. I was suffering then (and still do) from
					moods that kept my head under water (figuratively speaking) and allowed me to
					see things only from my own perspective, without calmly considering what the
					others — those whom I, with my mercurial temperament, had hurt or offended —
					had said, and then acting as they would have done.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I hid inside myself, thought of no one but myself and calmly wrote down all my
					joy, sarcasm and sorrow in my diary. Because this diary has become a kind of
					memory book, it means a great deal to me, but I could easily write "over and
					done with" on many of its pages.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I was furious at Mother (and still am a lot of the time). It's true, she didn't
					understand me, but I didn't understand her either. Because she loved me, she
					was tender and affectionate, but because of the difficult situations I put her
					in, and the sad circumstances in which she found herself, she was nervous and
					irritable, so I can understand why she was often short with me.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I was offended, took it far too much to heart and was insolent and beastly to
					her, which, in turn, made her unhappy. We were caught in a vicious circle of
					unpleasantness and sorrow. Not a very happy period for either of us, but at
					least it's coming to an end. I didn't want to see what was going on, and I felt
					very sorry for myself, but that's understandable too.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Those violent outbursts on paper are simply expressions of anger that, in
					normal life, I could have worked off by locking myself in my room and stamping
					my foot a few times or calling Mother names behind her back.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					The period of tearfully passing judgment on Mother is over. I've grown wiser
					and Mother's nerves are a bit steadier. Most of the time I manage to hold my
					tongue when I'm annoyed, and she does too; so on the surface, we seem to be
					getting along better. But there's one thing I can't do, and that's to love
					Mother with the devotion of a child.
				-
			-
				Entry 96 - SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I soothe my conscience with the thought that it's better for unkind words to be
					down on paper than for Mother to have to carry them around in her heart.

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Today I have two things to confess. It's going to take a long time, but I have
					to tell them to someone, and you're the most likely candidate, since I know
					you'll keep a secret, no matter what happens.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The first is about Mother. As you know, I've frequently complained about her
					and then tried my best to be nice. I've suddenly realized what's wrong with
					her. Mother has said that she sees us more as friends than as daughters. That's
					all very nice, of course, except that a friend can't take the place of a
					mother. I need my mother to set a good example and be a person I can respect,
					but in most matters she's an example of what not to do. I have the feeling that
					Margot thinks so differently about these things that she'd never be able to
					understand what I've just told you. And Father avoids all conversations having
					to do with Mother.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I imagine a mother as a woman who, first and foremost, possesses a great deal
					of tact, especially toward her adolescent children, and not one who, like
					Momsy, pokes fun at me when I cry. Not because I'm in pain, but because of
					other things.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					This may seem trivial, but there's one incident I've never forgiven her for. It
					happened one day when I had to go to the dentist. Mother and Margot planned to
					go with me and agreed I should take my bicycle. When the dentist was finished
					and we were back outside, Margot and Mother very sweetly informed me that they
					were going downtown to buy or look at something, I don't remember what, and of
					course I wanted to go along. But they said I couldn't come because I had my
					bike with me. Tears of rage rushed to my eyes, and Margot and Mother began
					laughing at me. I was so furious that I stuck my tongue out at them, right
					there on the street. A little old lady happened to be passing by, and she
					looked terribly shocked. I rode my bike home and must have cried for hours.
					Strangely enough, even though Mother has wounded me thousands of times, this
					particular wound still stings whenever I think of how angry I was.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I find it difficult to confess the second one because it's about myself. I'm
					not prudish, Kitty, and yet every time they give a blow-by-blow account of
					their trips to the bathroom, which they often do, my whole body rises in
					revolt.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Yesterday I read an article on blushing by Sis Heyster. It was as if she'd
					addressed it directly to me. Not that I blush easily, but the rest of the
					article did apply. What she basically says is that during puberty girls
					withdraw into themselves and begin thinking about the wondrous changes taking
					place in their bodies. I feel that too, which probably accounts for my recent
					embarrassment over Margot, Mother and Father. On the other hand, Margot is a
					lot shyer than I am, and yet she's not in the least embarrassed.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I think that what's happening to me is so wonderful, and I don't just mean the
					changes taking place on the outside of my body, but also those on the inside. I
					never discuss myself or any of these things with others, which is why I have to
					talk about them to myself. Whenever I get my period (and that's only been three
					times), I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, discomfort and mess,
					I'm carrying around a sweet secret. So even though it's a nuisance, in a
					certain way I'm always looking forward to the time when I'll feel that secret
					inside me once again.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Sis Heyster also writes that girls my age feel very insecure about themselves
					and are just beginning to discover that they're individuals with their own
					ideas, thoughts and habits. I'd just turned thirteen when I came here, so I
					started thinking about myself and realized that I've become an "independent
					person" sooner than most girls. Sometimes when I lie in bed at night I feel a
					terrible urge to touch my breasts and listen to the quiet, steady beating of my
					heart.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Unconsciously, I had these feelings even before I came here. Once when I was
					spending the night at Jacque's, I could no longer restrain my curiosity about
					her body, which she'd always hidden from me and which I'd never seen. I asked
					her whether, as proof of our friendiship, we could touch each other's breasts.
					Jacque refused.
				-
			-
				Entry 97 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I also had a terrible desire to kiss her, which I did. Every time I see a
					female nude, such as the Venus in my art history book, I go into ecstasy.
					Sometimes I find them so exquisite I have to struggle to hold back my tears. If
					only I had a girlfriend!

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					My longing for someone to talk to has become so unbearable that I somehow took
					it into my head to select Peter for this role. On the few occasions when I have
					gone to Peter's room during the day, I've always thought it was nice and cozy.
					But Peter's too polite to show someone the door when they're bothering him, so
					I've never dared to stay long. I've always been afraid he'd think I was a pest.
					I've been looking for an excuse to linger in his room and get him talking
					without his noticing, and yesterday I got my chance. Peter, you see, is
					currently going through a crossword-puzzle craze, and he doesn't do anything
					else all day. I was helping him, and we soon wound up sitting across from each
					other at his table, Peter on the chair and me on the divan.
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					It gave me a wonderful feeling when I looked into his dark blue eyes and saw
					how bashful my unexpected visit had made him. I could read his innermost
					thoughts, and in his face I saw a look of helplessness and uncertainty as to
					how to behave, and at the same time a flicker of awareness of his masculinity.
					I saw his shyness, and I melted. I wanted to say, "Tell me about yourself. Look
					beneath my chatty exterior." But I found that it was easier to think up
					questions than to ask them.
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The evening came to a close, and nothing happened, except that I told him about
					the article on blushing. Not what I wrote you, of course, just that he would
					grow more secure as he got older. "
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					That night I lay in bed and cried my eyes out, all the i while making sure no
					one could hear me. The idea that I had to beg Peter for favors was simply
					revolting. But people will do almost anything to satisfy their longings; take
					me, for example, I've made up my mind to visit Peter more often and, somehow,
					get him to talk to me.
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					You mustn't think I'm in love with Peter, because I'm not. If the van Daans had
					had a daughter instead of a son, I'd have tried to make friends with her.
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					This morning I woke up just before seven and immediately remembered what I'd
					been dreaming about. I was sitting on a chair and across from me was Peter. . .
					Peter Schiff. We were looking at a book of drawings by Mary Bos. The dream was
					so vivid
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I can even remember some of the drawings. But that wasn't all — the dream went
					on. Peter's eyes suddenly met mine, and I stared for a long time into those
					velvety brown eyes. Then he said very softly, "If I'd only known, I'd have come
					to you long ago!" I turned abruptly away, overcome by emotion. And then I felt
					a soft, oh-so-cool and gentle cheek against mine, and it felt so good, so good
					. . .
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					At that point I woke up, still feeling his cheek against mine and his brown
					eyes staring deep into my heart, so deep that he could read how much I'd loved
					him and how much I still do. Again my eyes filled with tears, and I was sad
					because I'd lost him once more, and yet at the same time glad because I knew
					with certainty that Peter is still the only one for me. '
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					It's funny, but I often have such vivid images in my dreams. One night I saw
					Grammy* [*Grammy is Anne's grandmother on her father's side, and Grandma her
					grandmother on her mother's side.] so clearly that I could even make out her
					skin of soft, crinkly velvet. Another time Grandma appeared to me as a guardian
					angel. After that it was Hanneli, who still symbolizes to me the suffering of
					my friends as well as that of Jews in general, so that when I'm praying for
					her, I'm also praying for all the Jews and all those in need.
				-
			-
				Entry 98 - THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1944: Paragraph 11

					And now Peter, my dearest Peter. I've never had such a clear mental image of

				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 2

					I'm such an idiot. I forgot that I haven't yet told you the story of my one
					true love.
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					When I was a little girl, way back in kindergarten, I took a liking to Sally
					Kimmel. His father was gone, and he and his mother lived with an aunt. One of
					Sally's cousins was a good-looking, slender, dark-haired boy named Appy, who
					later turned out to look like a movie idol and aroused more admiration than the
					short, comical, chubby Sally. For a long time we went everywhere together, but
					aside from that, my love was unrequited until Peter crossed my path. I had an
					out-and-out crush on him. He liked me too, and we were inseparable for one
					whole summer. I can still see us walking hand in hand through our neighborhood,
					Peter in a white cotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the
					summer vacation he went to the seventh grade at the middle school, while I was
					in the sixth grade at the grammar school. He'd pick me up on the way home, or
					I'd pick him up. Peter was the ideal boy: tall, good-looking and slender, with
					a serious, quiet and intelligent face. He had dark hair, beautiful brown eyes,
					ruddy cheeks and a nicely pointed nose. I was crazy about his smile, which made
					him look so boyish and mischievous.
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I'd gone away to the countryside during summer vacation, and when I came back,
					Peter was no longer at his old address; he'd moved and was living with a much
					older boy, who apparently told him I was just a kid, because Peter stopped
					seeing me. I loved him so much that I didn't want to face the truth. I kept
					clinging to him until the day I finally realized that if I continued to chase
					after him, people would say I was boy-crazy.
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					The years went by. Peter hung around with girls his own age and no longer
					bothered to say hello to me. I started school at the Jewish Lyceum, and several
					boys in my class were in love with me. I enjoyed it and felt honored by their
					attentions, but that was all. Later on, Hello had a terrible crush on me, but
					as I've already told you, I never fell in love again.
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					There's a saying: "Time heals all wounds." That's how it was with me. I told
					myself I'd forgotten Peter and no longer liked him in the least. But my
					memories of him were so strong that I had to admit to myself that the only
					reason I no longer liked him was that I was jealous of the other girls. This
					morning I realized that nothing has changed; on the contrary, as I've grown
					older and more mature, my love has grown along with me. I can understand now
					that Peter thought I was childish, and yet it still hurts to think he'd
					forgotten me completely. I saw his face so clearly; I knew for certain that no
					one but Peter could have stuck in my mind that way.
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I've been in an utter state of confusion today. When Father kissed me this
					morning, I wanted to shout, "Oh, if only you were Peter!" I've been thinking of
					him constantly, and all day long I've been repeating to myself, "Oh, Petel, my
					darling, darling Petel . .
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Where can I find help? I simply have to go on living and praying to God that,
					if we ever get out of here, Peter's path will cross mine and he'll gaze into my
					eyes, read the love in them and say, "Oh, Anne, if I'd only known, I'd have
					come to you long ago."
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Once when Father and I were talking about sex, he said I was too young to
					understand that kind of desire. But I thought I did understand it, and now I'm
					sure I do. Nothing is as dear to me now as my darling Petel!
				-
			-
				Entry 99 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I saw my face in the mirror, and it looked so different. My eyes were clear and
					deep, my cheeks were rosy, which they hadn't been in weeks, my mouth was much
					softer. I looked happy, and yet there was something so sad in my expression
					that the smile immediately faded from my lips. I'm not happy, since I know
					Petel's not thinking of me, and yet I can still feel his beautiful eyes gazing
					at me and his cool, soft cheek against mine. . . Oh, Petel, Petel, how am I
					ever going to free myself from your image? Wouldn't anyone who took your place
					be a poor substitute? I love you, with a love so great that it simply couldn't
					keep growing inside my heart, but had to leap out and reveal itself in all its
					magnitude.

					I'm currently going through a dance and ballet craze and am diligently

					out of a lacy lavender slip belonging to Momsy. Bias tape is threaded through
					the top and tied just above the bust. A pink corded ribbon completes the
					ensemble. I tried to turn my tennis shoes into ballet slippers, but with no
					success. My stiff limbs are well on the way to becoming as limber as they used
					to be. A terrific exercise is to sit on the floor, place a heel in each hand

					Everyone here is reading a book called A Cloudless Morning. Mother thought it

				Entry 100 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944: Paragraph 5

				-
					I think Mother believes that Margot and I have a better relationship with our

					involved in the lives of her children than she is. She must have my sister in
					mind, since I don't believe Margot has the same problems and thoughts as I do.
					Far be it from me to point out to Mother that one of her daughters is not at
					all what she imagines. She'd be completely bewildered, and anyway, she'd never
					be able to change; I'd like to spare her that grief, especially since I know
					that everything would remain the same. Mother does sense that Margot loves her
					much more than I do, but she thinks I'm just going through a phase.

				Entry 100 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Before I came here, when I didn't think about things as much as I do now, I
					occasionally had the feeling that I didn't belong to Momsy, Pirn and Margot and
					that I would always be an outsider. I sometimes went around for six months at a
					time pretending I was an orphan. Then I'd chastise myself for playing the
					victim, when really, I'd always been so fortunate. After that I'd force myself
					to be friendly for a while. Every morning when I heard footsteps on the stairs,
					I hoped it would be Mother coming to say good morning. I'd greet her warmly,
					because I honesly did look forward to her affectionate glance. But then she'd
					snap at me for having made some comment or other (and I'd go off to school
					feeling completely discouraged.
				-
			-
				Entry 100 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					On the way home I'd make excuses for her, telling myself that she had so many
					worries. I'd arrive home in high spirits, chatting nineteen to the dozen, until
					the events of the morning would repeat themselves and I'd leave the room with
					my schoolbag in my hand and a pensive look on my face. Sometimes I'd decide to
					stay angry, but then I always had so much to talk about after school that I'd
					forget my resolution and want Mother to stop whatever she was doing and lend a
					willing ear. Then the time would come once more when I no longer listened for
					the steps on the stairs and felt lonely and cried into my pillow every night.

				Entry 100 - WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944: Paragraph 10

					Everything has gotten much worse here. But you already knew that. Now God has

					I can rise above every nasty remark. Which of the people here would suspect
					that so much is going on in the mind of a teenage girl?

					There's no reason for me to go on describing all our quarrels and arguments

					Mother's birthday is rapidly approaching. She received some extra sugar from

					Or have we just had a stroke of bad luck? At mealtime, when Dussel helps

					I (there I go again!) don't know what's happened, but since my dream I keep
					noticing how I've changed. By the way, I dreamed about Peter again last night
					and once again I felt his eyes penetrate mine, but this dream was less vivid

					You know that I always used to be jealous of Margot's relationship with Father.
					There's not a trace of my jealousy left now; I still feel hurt when Father's
					nerves cause him to be unreasonable toward me, but then I think, "I can't blame
					you for being the way you are. You talk so much about the minds of children and
					adolescents, but you don't know the first thing about them!" I long for more
					than Father's affection, more than his hugs and kisses. Isn't it awful of me to
					be so preoccupied with myself? Shouldn't I, who want to be good and kind,
					forgive them first? I forgive Mother too, but every time she makes a sarcastic
					remark or laughs at me, it's all I can do to control myself.

					P.S. Father asked if I told you about the cake. For Mother's birthday, she

				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Can you tell me why people go to such lengths to hide their real selves? Or why
					I always behave very differently when I'm in the company of others? Why do
					people have so little trust in one another? I know there must be a reason, but
					sometimes I think it's horrible that you can't ever confide in anyone, not even
					those closest to you.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					It seems as if I've grown up since the night I had that dream, as if I've
					become more independent. You'll be amazed when I tell you that even my attitude
					toward the van Daans has changed. I've stopped looking at all the discussions
					and arguments from my family's biased point of view. What's brought on such a
					radical change? Well, you see, I suddenly realized that if Mother had been
					different, if she'd been a real mom, our relationship would have been very,
					very different. Mrs. van Daan is by no means a wonderful person, yet half the
					arguments could have been avoided if Mother hadn't been so hard to deal with
					every time they got onto a tricky subject. Mrs. van Daan does have one good
					point, though: you can talk to her. She may be selfish, stingy and underhanded,
					but she'll readily back down as long as you don't provoke her and make her
					unreasonable. This tactic doesn't work every time, but if you're patient, you
					can keep trying and see how far you get.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					All the conflicts about our upbringing, about not pampering children, about the
					food — about everything, absolutely everything — might have taken a different
					turn if we'd remained open and on friendly terms instead of always seeing the
					worst side.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I know exactly what you're going to say, Kitty.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"But, Anne, are these words really coming from your lips? From you, who have
					had to put up with so many unkind words from upstairs? From you, who are aware
					of all the injustices?"
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					And yet they are coming from me. I want to take a fresh look at things and form
					my own opinion, not just ape my parents, as in the proverb "The apple never
					falls far from the tree." I want to reexamine the van Daans and decide for
					myself what's true and what's been blown out of proportion. If I wind up being
					disappointed in them, I can always side with Father and Mother. But if not, I
					can try to change their attitude. And if that doesn't work, I'll have to stick
					with my own opinions and judgment. I'll take every opportunity to speak openly
					to Mrs. van D. about our many differences and not be afraid — despite my
					reputation as a smart aleck — to offer my impartial opinion. I won't say
					anything negative about my own family, though that doesn't mean I won't defend
					them if somebody else does, and as of today, my gossiping is a thing of the
					past.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Up to now I was absolutely convinced that the van Daans were entirely to blame
					for the quarrels, but now I'm sure the fault was largely ours. We were right as
					far as the subject matter was concerned, but intelligent people (such as
					ourselves!) should have more insight into how to deal with others.
				-
			-
				Entry 103 - SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1944: Paragraph 9

					I hope I've got at least a touch of that insight, and that I'll find an
					occasion to put it to good use.

					Dearest Kitty,

			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					A very strange thing has happened to me. (Actually, "happened" isn't quite the
					right word.)
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Before I came here, whenever anyone at home or at school talked about sex, they
					were either secretive or disgusting. Any words having to do with sex were
					spoken in a low whisper, and kids who weren't in the know were often laughed
					at. That struck me as odd, and I often wondered why people were so mysterious
					or obnoxious when they talked about this subject. But because I couldn't change
					things, I said as little as possible or asked my girlfriends for information.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					After I'd learned quite a lot, Mother once said to me, "Anne, let me give you
					some good advice. Never discuss this with boys, and if they bring it up, don't
					answer them."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I still remember my exact reply. "No, of course not," I exclaimed. "Imagine!"
					And nothing more was said.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					When we first went into hiding, Father often told me about things I'd rather
					have heard from Mother, and I learned the rest from books or things I picked up
					in conversations.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Peter van Daan wasn't ever as obnoxious about this subject as the boys at
					school. Or maybe just once or twice, in the beginning, though he wasn't trying
					to get me to talk. Mrs. van Daan once told us she'd never discussed these
					matters with Peter, and as far as she knew, neither had her husband. Apparently
					she didn't even know how much Peter knew or where he got his information.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Yesterday, when Margot, Peter and I were peeling potatoes, the conversation
					somehow turned to Boche. "We're still not sure whether Boche is a boy or a
					girl, are we?" I asked.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Yes we are, he answered. "Boche is a tomcat."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I began to laugh. "Some tomcat if he's pregnant."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Peter and Margot joined in the laughter. You see, a month or two ago Peter
					informed us that Boche was sure to have kittens before long, because her
					stomach was rapidly swelling. However, Boche's fat tummy turned out to be due
					to a bunch of stolen bones. No kittens were growing inside, much less about to
					be born.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Peter felt called upon to defend himself against my accusation. "Come with me.
					You can see for yourself. I was horsing around with the cat one day, and I
					could definitely see it was a 'he.' "
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Unable to restrain my curiosity, I went with him to the warehouse. Boche,
					however, wasn't receiving visitors at that hour, and was nowhere in sight. We
					waited for a while, but when it got cold, we went back upstairs.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Later that afternoon I heard Peter go downstairs for the second time. I
					mustered the courage to walk through the silent house by myself and reached the
					warehouse. Boche was on the packing table, playing with Peter, who was getting
					ready to put him on the scale and weigh him.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					"Hi, do you want to have a look?" Without any preliminaries, he picked up the
					cat, turned him over on his back, deftly held his head and paws and began the
					lesson. "This is the male sexual organ, these are a few stray hairs, and that's
					his backside."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					The cat flipped himself over and stood up on his little white feet.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					If any other boy had pointed out the "male sexual organ" to me, I would never
					have given him a second glance. But Peter went on talking in a normal voice
					about what is otherwise a very awkward subject. Nor did he have any ulterior
					motives. By the time he'd finished, I felt so much at ease that I started
					acting normally too. We played with Boche, had a good time, chatted a bit and
					finally sauntered through the long warehouse to the door. "Were you there when
					Mouschi was fixed?"
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					"Yeah, sure. It doesn't take long. They give the cat an anesthetic, of course."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					"Do they take something out?"
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					"No, the vet just snips the tube. There's nothing to see on the outside."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					I had to get up my nerve to ask a question, since it wasn't as "normal" as I
					thought. "Peter, the German word Geschlechtsteil means 'sexual organ,' doesn't
					it? But then the male and female ones have different names."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					"I know that."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					"The female one is a vagina, that I know, but I don't know what it's called in
					males."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 24
			-
				-
					"Oh well," I said. "How are we supposed to know these words? Most of the time
					you just come across them by accident."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 25
			-
				-
					"Why wait? I'll ask my parents. They know more than I do and they've had more
					experience."
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 26
			-
				-
					We were already on the stairs, so nothing more was said.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 27
			-
				-
					Yes, it really did happen. I'd never have talked to a girl about this in such a
					normal tone of voice. I'm also certain that this isn't what Mother meant when
					she warned me about boys.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 28
			-
				-
					All the same, I wasn't exactly my usual self for the rest of the day. When I
					thought back to our talk, it struck me as odd. But I've learned at least one
					thing: there are young people, even those of the opposite sex, who can discuss
					these things naturally, without cracking jokes.
				-
			-
				Entry 104 - MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1944: Paragraph 29

					Is Peter really going to ask his parents a lot of questions? Is he really the

					In recent weeks I've developed a great liking for family trees and the

					Although I'm extremely diligent when it comes to my schoolwork and can pretty

					sorting out and looking over my movie -star collection, which has grown to a
					very respectable size. Mr. Kugler makes me happy every Monday by bringing me a
					copy of Cinema & Theater magazine. The less worldly members of our household
					often refer to this small indulgence as a waste of money, yet they never fail
					to be surprised at how accurately I can list the actors in any given movie,
					even after a year. Bep, who often goes to the movies with her boyfriend on her
					day off, tells me on

					Whenever I come sailing in with a new hairstyle, I I can read the disapproval

					As for the hairdo, it doesn't hold its set for ~ more than half an hour. By
					that time I'm so sick and tired i of their remarks that I race to the bathroom
					and restore my hair to its normal mass of curls.

			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					This morning I was wondering whether you ever felt like a cow, having to chew
					my stale news over and over again until you're so fed up with the monotonous
					fare that you yawn and secretly wish Anne would dig up something new.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Sorry, I know you find it dull as ditchwater, but imagine how sick and tired I
					am of hearing the same old stuff. If the talk at mealtime isn't about politics
					or good food, then Mother or Mrs. van D. trot out stories about their childhood
					that we've heard a thousand times before, or Dussel goes on and on about
					beautiful racehorses, his Charlotte's extensive wardrobe, leaky rowboats, boys
					who can swim at the age of four, aching muscles and frightened patients. It all
					boils down to this: whenever one of the eight of us opens his mouth, the other
					seven can finish the story for him. We know the punch line of every joke before
					it gets told, so that whoever's telling it is left to laugh alone. The various
					milkmen, grocers and butchers of the two former housewives have been praised to
					the skies or run into the ground so many times that in our imaginations they've
					grown as old as Methuselah; there's absolutely no chance of anything new or
					fresh being brought up for discussion in the Annex.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Still, all this might be bearable if only the grown-ups weren't in the habit of
					repeating the stories we hear from Mr. Kleiman, jan or Miep, each time
					embellishing them with a few details of their own, so that I often have to
					pinch my arm under the table to keep myself from setting the enthusiastic
					storyteller on the right track. Little children, such as Anne, must never, ever
					correct their elders, no matter how many blunders they make or how often they
					let their imaginations run away with them.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Jan and Mr. Kleiman love talking about people who have gone underground or into
					hiding; they know we're eager to hear about others in our situation and that we
					truly sympathize with the sorrow of those who've been arrested as well as the
					joy of prisoners who've been freed.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Going underground or into hiding has become as routine as the proverbial pipe
					and slippers that used to await the man of the house after a long day at work.
					There are many resistance groups, such as Free Netherlands, that forge identity
					cards, provide financial support to those in hiding, organize hiding places and
					find work for young Christians who go underground. It's amazing how much these
					generous and unselfish people do, risking their own lives to help and save
					others.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The best example of this is our own helpers, who have managed to pull us
					through so far and will hopefully bring us safely to shore, because otherwise
					they'll find themselves sharing the fate of those they're trying to protect.
					Never have they uttered a single word about the burden we must be, never have
					they complained that we're too much trouble. They come upstairs every day and
					talk to the men about business and politics, to the women about food and
					wartime difficulties and to the children about books and newspapers. They put
					on their most cheerful expressions, bring flowers and gifts for birthdays and
					holidays and are always ready to do what they can. That's something we should
					never forget; while others display their heroism in battle or against the
					Germans, our helpers prove theirs every day by their good spirits and
					affection.
				-
			-
				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					The most bizarre stories are making the rounds, yet most of them are really
					true. For instance, Mr. Kleiman reported this week that a soccer match was held
					in the province of Gelderland; one team consisted entirely of men who had gone
					underground, and the other of eleven Military Policemen. In Hilversum, new
					registration cards were issued. In order for the many people in hiding to get
					their rations (you have to show this card to obtain your ration book or else
					pay 60 guilders a book), the registrar asked all those hiding in that district
					to pick up their cards at a specified hour, when the documents could be
					collected at a separate table.

				Entry 106 - FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 9

					I still haven't gone to the warehouse yet, but maybe sometime soon. Last night

					Invasion fever is mounting daily throughout the country. If you were here, I'm

					The papers are full of invasion news and are driving everyone insane with such
					statements as: "In the event of a British landing in Holland, the Germans will
					do what they can to defend the country, even flooding it, if necessary."
					They've published maps of Holland with the potential flood areas marked. Since
					large portions of Amsterdam were shaded in, our first question was what we
					should do if the water in the streets rose to above our waists. This tricky
					question elicited a variety of responses:

					So now you have a rough idea of what's going on, don't you, Kit? This

					A good example of the explicit warnings of the male contingent is the following

			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 30
			-
				-
					Annex: "We're afraid that when the Germans retreat, they'll take the entire

				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 31
			-
				-
					Jan: "That's impossible. They haven't got enough trains."
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 32
			-
				-
					Annex: "Trains? Do you really think they'd put civilians on trains? Absolutely
					not. Everyone would have to hoof it." (Or, as Dussel always says, per pedes
					apostolorum.)
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 33
			-
				-
					Jan: "I can't believe that. You're always looking on the dark side. What reason
					would they have to round up all the civilians and take them along?"
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 34
			-
				-
					Annex: "Don't you remember Goebbels saying that if the Germans have to go,
					they'll slam the doors to all the occupied territories behind them?"
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 35

				-
					Jan: "They've said a lot of things."
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 36
			-
				-
					Annex: "Do you think the Germans are too noble or humane to do it? Their

				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 41
			-
				-
					Jan: "You shouldn't include the Jews. I don't think anyone knows what's going

					propaganda purposes, just like the Germans."
				-
			-
				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 42
			-
				-
					Annex: "Absolutely not. The BBC has always told the truth. And even if the news

				Entry 108 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1944: Paragraph 43

					I'll spare you the rest of our conversations. I'm very calm and take no notice

					change events anyway. I'll just let matters take their course and concentrate
					on studying and hope that everything will be all right in the end.

					Dear Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I can't tell you how I feel. One minute I'm longing for peace and quiet, and
					the next for a little fun. We've forgotten how to laugh — I mean, laughing so
					hard you can t stop.
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					This morning I had "the giggles"; you know, the kind we used to have at school.
					Margot and I were giggling like real teenagers.
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Last night there was another scene with Mother. Margot was tucking her wool
					blanket around her when suddenly she leapt out of bed and carefully examined
					the blanket. What do you think she found? A pin! Mother had patched the blanket
					and forgotten to take it out. Father shook his head meaningfully and made a
					comment about how careless Mother is. Soon afterward Mother came in from the
					bathroom, and just to tease her I said, "Du bist doch eine echte Rabenmutter."
					[Oh, you are cruel.]
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Of course, she asked me why I'd said that, and we told her about the pin she'd
					overlooked. She immediately assumed her haughtiest expression and said, "You're
					a fine one to talk. When you're sewing, the entire floor is covered with pins.
					And look, you've left the manicure set lying around again. You never put that
					away either!"
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I said I hadn't used it, and Margot backed me up, since she was the guilty
					party.
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Mother went on talking about how messy I was until I got fed up and said,
					rather curtly, "I wasn't even the one who said you were careless. I'm always
					getting blamed for other people's mistakes!"
				-
			-
				Entry 109 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Mother fell silent, and less than a minute later I was obliged to kiss her
					good-night. This incident may not have been very important, but these days
					everything gets on my nerves.

				Entry 110 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					The sun is shining, the sky is deep blue, there's a magnificent breeze, and I'm
					longing — really longing — for everything: conversation, freedom, friends,
					being alone. I long. . . to cry! I feel as if I were about to explode. I know
					crying would help, but I can't cry. I'm restless. I walk from one room to
					another, breathe through the crack in the window frame, feel my heart beating
					as if to say, "Fulfill my longing at last. . ."

					I think spring is inside me. I feel spring awakening, I feel it in my entire

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					A lot has changed for me since Saturday. What's happened is this: I was longing
					for something (and still am), but. . . a small, a very small, part of the
					problem has been resolved.
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					On Sunday morning I noticed, to my great joy (I'll be honest with you), that
					Peter kept looking at me. Not in the usual way. I don't know, I can't explain
					it, but I suddenly had the feeling he wasn't as in love with Margot as I used
					to think. All day long I tried not to look at him too much, because whenever I
					did, I caught him looking at me and then — well, it made me feel wonderful
					inside, and that's not a feeling I should have too often.
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Sunday evening everyone, except Pirn and me, was clustered around the radio,
					listening to the "Immortal Music of the German Masters." Dussel kept twisting
					and turning the knobs, which annoyed Peter, and the others too. After
					restraining himself for half an hour, Peter asked somewhat irritably if he
					would stop fiddling with the radio. Dussel replied in his haughtiest tone, "Ich
					mach' das schon!" [I'll decide that.] Peter got angry and made an insolent
					remark. Mr. van Daan sided with him, and Dussel had to back down. That was it.
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					The reason for the disagreement wasn't particularly interesting in and of
					itself, but Peter has apparently taken the matter very much to heart, because
					this morning, when I was rummaging around in the crate of books in the attic,
					Peter came up and began telling me what had happened. I didn't know anything
					about it, but Peter soon realized he'd found an attentive listener and started
					warming up to his subject.
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Well, it's like this," he said. "I don't usually talk much, since I know
					beforehand I'll just be tongue-tied. I start stuttering and blushing and I
					twist my words around so much I finally have to stop, because I can't find the
					right words. That's what happened yesterday. I meant to say something entirely
					different, but once I started, I got all mixed up. It's awful. I used to have a
					bad habit, and sometimes I wish I still did: whenever I was mad at someone, I'd
					beat them up instead of arguing with them. I know this method won't get me
					anywhere, and that's why I admire you. You're never at a loss for words: you
					say exactly what you want to say and aren't in the least bit shy."
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					"Oh, you're wrong about that," I replied. "Most of what I say comes out very
					differently from the way I'd planned. Plus I talk too much and too long, and
					that's just as bad."
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					"Maybe, but you have the advantage that no one can see you're embarrassed. You
					don't blush or go to pieces."
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I couldn't help being secretly amused at his words. However, since I wanted him
					to go on talking quietly about himself, I hid my laughter, sat down on a
					cushion on the floor, wrapped my arms around my knees and gazed at him
					intently.
				-
			-
				Entry 111 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I'm glad there's someone else in this house who flies into the same rages as I
					do. Peter seemed relieved that he could criticize Dussel without being afraid
					I'd tell. As for me, I was pleased too, because I sensed a strong feeling of
					fellowship, which I only remember having had with my girlfriends.

				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					The minor run-in with Dussel had several repercussions, for which he had only
					himself to blame. Monday evening Dussel came in to see Mother and told her
				-
			-
				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					triumphantly that Peter had asked him that morning if he'd slept well, and then
					added
				-
			-
				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					how sorry he was about what had happened Sunday evening — he hadn't really
					meant what he'd said. Dussel assured him he hadn't taken it to heart. So
					everYthing was right as rain again. Mother passed this story on to me, and I
					was secretly amazed that Peter, who'd been so angry at Dussel, had humbled
					himself, despite all his assurances to the contrary.
				-
			-
				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I couldn't refrain from sounding Peter out on the subject, and he instantly
					replied that Dussel had been lying. You should have seen Peter's face. I wish
					I'd had a camera. Indignation, rage, indecision, agitation and much more
					crossed his face in rapid succession.
				-
			-
				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					That evening Mr. van Daan and Peter really told Dussel off. But it couldn't
					have been all that bad, since Peter had another dental appointment today.
				-
			-
				Entry 112 - TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944: Paragraph 6

				-
					Actually, they never wanted to speak to each other again.

			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Peter and I hadn't talked to each other all day, except for a few meaningless
					words. It was too cold to go up to the attic, and anyway, it was Margot's
					birthday. At twelve-thirty he came to look at the presents and hung around
					chatting longer than was strictly necessary, something he'd never have done
					otherwise. But I got my chance in the afternoon. Since I felt like spoiling
					Margot on her birthday, I went to get the coffee, and after that the potatoes.
					When I came to Peter's room, he immediately took his papers off the stairs, and
					I asked if I should close the trapdoor to the attic.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					"Sure," he said, "go ahead. When you're ready to come back down, just knock and
					I'll open it for you."
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I thanked him, went upstairs and spent at least ten minutes searching around in
					the barrel for the smallest potatoes. My back started aching, and the attic was
					cold. Naturally, I didn't bother to knock but opened the trap-door myself. But
					he obligingly got up and took the pan out of my hands.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"I did my best, but I couldn't find any smaller ones."
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"Did you look in the big barrel?"
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Yes, I've been through them all."
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					By this time I was at the bottom of the stairs, and he examined the pan of
					potatoes he was still holding. "Oh, but these are fine," he said, and added, as
					I took the pan from him, "My compliments!"
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					As he said this, he gave me such a warm, tender look that I started glowing
					inside. I could tell he wanted to please me, but since he couldn't make a long
					complimentary speech, he said everything with his eyes. I understood him so
					well and was very grateful. It still makes me happy to think back to those
					words and that look!
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					When I went downstairs, Mother said she needed more potatoes, this time for
					dinner, so I volunteered to go back up. When I entered Peter's room, I
					apologized for disturbing him again. As I was going up the stairs, he stood up,
					went over to stand between the stairs and the wall, grabbed my arm and tried to
					stop me.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					"I'll go," he said. "I have to go upstairs anyway."
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I replied that it wasn't really necessary, that I didn't have to get only the
					small ones this time. Convinced, he let go of my arm. On my way back, he opened
					the trapdoor and once again took the pan from me. Standing by the door, I
					asked, "What are you working on?"
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					"French," he replied.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					I asked if I could take a look at his lessons. Then I went to wash my hands and
					sat down across from him on the divan.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					After I'd explained some French to him, we began to talk. He told me that after
					the war he wanted to go to the Dutch East Indies and live on a rubber
					plantation. He talked about his life at home, the black market and how he felt
					like a worthless bum. I told him he had a big inferiority complex. He talked
					about the war, saying that Russia and England were bound to go to war against
					each other, and about the Jews. He said life would have been much easier if
					he'd been a Christian or could become one after the war. I asked if he wanted
					to be baptized, but that wasn't what he meant either. He said he'd never be
					able to feel like a Christian, but that after the war he'd make sure nobody
					would know he was Jewish. I felt a momentary pang. It's such a shame he still
					has a touch of dishonesty in him.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					Peter added, "The Jews have been and always will be the chosen people!"
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					I answered, "Just this once, I hope they'll be chosen for something good!"
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					But we went on chatting very pleasantly, about Father, about judging human
					character and all sorts of things, so many that I can't even remember them all.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					I left at a quarter past five, because Bep had arrived.
				-
			-
				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					That evening he said something else I thought was nice. We were talking about

					I now have a better understanding of why he always hugs Mouschi so tightly. He
					obviously needs affection too. I forgot to mention something else he was
					talking about. He said, "No, I'm not afraid, except when it comes to things
					about myself, but I'm working on that."

				Entry 113 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1944: Paragraph 22

					Peter has a huge inferiority complex. For example, he always thinks he's so
					stupid and we're so smart. When I help him with French, he thanks me a thousand
					times. One of these days I'm going to say, "Oh, cut it out! You're much better
					at English and geography!"

					I was upstairs this morning, since I promised Mrs. van D. I'd read her some of
					my stories. I began with "Eva's Dream," which she liked a lot, and then I read
					a few passages from "The Secret Annex," which had her in stitches. Peter also
					listened for a while (just the last part) and asked if I'd come to his room
					sometime to read more.

				Entry 114 - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1944: Paragraph 3

					I decided I had to take a chance right then and there, so I got my notebook and
					let him read that bit where Cady and Hans talk about God. I can't really tell
					what kind of impression it made on him. He said something I don't quite
					remember, not about whether it was good, but about the idea behind it. I told
					him I just wanted him to see that I didn't write only amusing things. He
					nodded, and I left the room. We'll see if I hear anything more!

				Entry 115 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					At least the object of my friendship is always here, and I don't have to be
					afraid of rivals (except for Margot). Don't think I'm in love, because I'm not,
					but I do have the feeling that something beautiful is going to develop between
					Peter and me, a kind of friendship and a feeling of trust. I go see him
					whenever I get the chance, and it's not the way it used to be, when he didn't
					know what to make of me. On the contrary, he's still talking away as I'm
					heading out the door. Mother doesn't like me going upstairs. She always says
					I'm bothering Peter and that I should leave him alone. Honestly, can't she
					credit me with some intuition? She always looks at me so oddly when I go to
					Peter's room. When I come down again, she asks me where I've been. It's
					terrible, but I'm beginning to hate her!

				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 2

					It's Saturday again, and that should tell you enough. This morning all was
					quiet. I spent nearly an hour upstairs making meatballs, but I only spoke to
					"him" in passing.
				-
			-
				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					When everyone went upstairs at two-thirty to either read or take a nap, I went
					downstairs, with blanket and all, to sit at the desk and read or write. Before
					long I couldn't take it anymore. I put my head in my arms and sobbed my heart
					out. The tears streamed down my cheeks, and I felt desperately unhappy. Oh, if
					only' 'he" had come to comfort me.
				-
			-
				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					It was past four by the time I went upstairs again. At five o'clock I set off
					to get some potatoes, hoping once again that we'd meet, but while I was still
					in the bathroom fixing my hair, he went to see Boche.
				-
			-
				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I wanted to help Mrs. van D. and went upstairs with my book and everything, but
					suddenly I felt the tears coming again. I raced downstairs to the bathroom,
					grabbing the hand mirror on the way. I sat there on the toilet, fully dressed,
					long after I was through, my tears leaving dark spots on the red of my apron,
					and I felt utterly dejected.
				-
			-
				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Here's what was going through my mind: "Oh, I'll never reach Peter this way.
					Who knows, maybe he doesn't even like me and he doesn't need anyone to confide
					in. Maybe he only thinks of me in a casual sort of way. I'll have to go back to
					being alone, without anyone to confide in and without Peter, without hope,
					comfort or anything to look forward to. Oh, if only I could rest my head on his
					shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and deserted! Who knows, maybe he
					doesn't care for me at all and looks at the others in the same tender way.
					Maybe I only imagined it was especially for me. Oh, Peter, if only you could
					hear me or see me. If the truth is disappointing, I won't be able to bear it."
				-
			-
				Entry 116 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1944: Paragraph 7

					Dussel gets up at eight. He goes to the bathroom, then downstairs, then up

					himself.
				-
			-
				Entry 117 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Nine-thirty. The stoves are lit, the blackout screen is taken down, and Mr. van
					Daan heads for the bathroom. One of my Sunday morning ordeals is having to lie
					in bed and look at Dussel's back when he's praying. I know it sounds strange,
					but a praying Dussel is a terrible sight to behold. It's not that he cries or
					gets sentimental, not at all, but he does spend a quarter of an hour — an
					entire fifteen minutes — rocking from his toes to his heels. Back and forth,
					back and forth. It goes on forever, and if I don't shut my eyes tight, my head
					starts to spin.
				-
			-
				Entry 117 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Ten-fifteen. The van Daans whistle; the bathroom's free. In the Frank family
					quarters, the first sleepy faces are beginning to emerge from their pillows.
					Then everything happens fast, fast, fast. Margot and I take turns doing the
					laundry. Since it's quite cold downstairs, we put on pants and head scarves.
					Meanwhile, Father is busy in the bathroom. Either Margot or I have a turn in
					the bathroom at eleven, and then we're all clean.
				-
			-
				Entry 117 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Eleven-thirty. Breakfast. I won't dwell on this, since there's enough talk
					about food without my bringing the subject up as well.
				-
			-
				Entry 117 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Twelve-fifteen. We each go our separate ways. Father, clad in overalls, gets
					down on his hands and knees and brushes the rug so vigorously that the room is
					enveloped in a cloud of dust. Mr. Dussel makes the beds (all wrong, of course),
					always whistling the same Beethoven violin concerto as he goes about his work.
					Mother can be heard shuffling around the attic as she hangs up the washing. Mr.
					van Daan puts on his hat and disappears into the lower regions, usually
					followed by Peter and Mouschi. Mrs. van D. dons a long apron, a black wool
					jacket and overshoes, winds a red wool scarf around her head, scoops up a
					bundle of dirty laundry and, with a well -rehearsed washerwoman's nod, heads
					downstairs. Margot and I do the dishes and straighten up the room.

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					The weather's been wonderful since yesterday, and I've perked up quite a bit.
					My writing, the best thing I have, is coming along well. I go to the attic
					almost every morning to get the stale air out of my lungs. This morning when I
					went there, Peter was busy cleaning up. He finished quickly and came over to
					where I was sitting on my favorite spot on the floor. The two of us looked out
					at the blue sky, the bare chestnut tree glistening with dew, the seagulls and
					other birds glinting with silver as they swooped through the air, and we were
					so moved and entranced that we couldn't speak. He stood with his head against a
					thick beam, while I sat. We breathed in the air, looked outside and both felt
					that the spell shouldn't be broken with words. We remained like this for a long
					while, and by the time he had to go to the loft to chop wood, I knew he was a
					good, decent boy. He climbed the ladder to the loft, and I followed; during the
					fifteen minutes he was chopping wood, we didn't say a word either. I watched
					him from where I was standing, and could see he was obviously doing his best to
					chop the right way and show off his strength. But I also looked out the open
					window, letting my eyes roam over a large part of Amsterdam, over the rooftops
					and on to the horizon, a strip of blue so pale it was almost invisible.
				-

				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 3

					"As long as this exists," I thought, "this sunshine and this cloudless sky, and

				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The best remedy for those who are frightened, lonely or unhappy is to go
					outside, somewhere they can be alone, alone with the sky, nature and God. For
					then and only then can you feel that everything is as it should be and that God
					wants people to be happy amid nature's beauty and simplicity.
				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 5

					As long as this exists, and that should be forever, I know that there will be

				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 6

					Oh, who knows, perhaps it won't be long before I can share this overwhelming

				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					We've been missing out on so much here, so very much, and for such a long time.
					I miss it just as much as you do. I'm not talking about external things, since
					we're well provided for in that sense; I mean the internal things. Like you, I
					long for freedom and fresh air, but I think we've been amply compensated for
					their loss. On the inside, I mean.
				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					This morning, when I was sitting in front of the window and taking a long, deep
					look outside at God and nature, I was happy, just plain happy. Peter, as long
					as people feel that kind of happiness within themselves, the joy of nature,
					health and much more besides, they'll always be able to recapture that
					happiness.
				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Riches, prestige, everything can be lost. But the happiness in your own heart
					can only be dimmed; it will always be there, as long as you live, to make you
					happy again.
				-
			-
				Entry 118 - WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23,1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Whenever you're feeling lonely or sad, try going to the loft on a beautiful day
					and looking outside. Not at the houses and the rooftops, but at the sky. As
					long as you can look fearlessly at the sky, you'll know that you're pure within
					and will find happiness once more.

			-
				Entry 119 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					From early in the morning to late at night, all I do is think about Peter. I
					fall asleep with his image before my eyes, dream about him and wake up with him
					still looking at me.
				-
			-
				Entry 119 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I have the strong feeling that Peter and I aren't really as different as we may
					seem on the surface, and I'll explain why: neither Peter nor I have a mother.
					His is too superficial, likes to flirt and doesn't concern herself much with
					what goes on in his head. Mine takes an active interest in my life, but has no
					tact, sensitivity or motherly understanding.
				-
			-
				Entry 119 - SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Both Peter and I are struggling with our innermost feelings. We're still unsure
					of ourselves and are too vulnerable, emotionally, to be dealt with so roughly.
					Whenever that happens, I want to run outside or hide my feelings. Instead, I
					bang the pots and pans, splash the water and am generally noisy, so that
					everyone wishes I were miles away. Peter's reaction is to shut himself up, say
					little, sit quietly and daydream, all the while carefully hiding his true self.
				-

			-
				-
					It's like a nightmare, one that goes on long after I'm awake. I see him nearly
					every hour of the day and yet I can't be with him, I can't let the others
					notice, and I have to pretend to be cheerful, though my heart is aching.
				-
			-
				Entry 120 - MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Peter Schiff and Peter van Daan have melted into one Peter, who's good and kind
					and whom I long for desperately. Mother's horrible, Father's nice, which makes
					him even more exasperating, and Margot's the worst, since she takes advantage
					of my smiling face to claim me for herself, when all I want is to be left
					alone.

			-

					Peter didn't join me in the attic, but went up to the loft to do some carpentry

				-
					My own affairs have been pushed to the background by ... a break-in. I'm boring
					you with all my break-ins, but what can I do when burglars take such pleasure
					in honoring Gies & Go. with their presence? This incident is much more
					complicated than the last one, in July 1943.
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Last night at seven-thirty Mr. van Daan was heading, as usual, for Mr. Kugler's
					office when he saw that both the glass door and the office door were open. He
					was surprised, but he went on through and was even more astonished to see that
					the alcove doors were open as well and that there was a terrible mess in the
					front office.
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"There's been a burglary" flashed through his mind. But just to make sure, he
					went downstairs to the front door, checked the lock and found everything
					closed. "Bep and
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Peter must just have been very careless this evening," Mr. van. D. concluded.
					He remained for a while in Mr. Kugler's office, switched off the lamp and went
					upstairs without worrying much about the open doors or the messy office.
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Early this morning Peter knocked at our door to tell us that the front door was
					wide open and that the projector and Mr. Kugler's new briefcase had disappeared
					from the closet. Peter was instructed to lock the door. Mr. van Daan told us
					his discoveries of the night before, and we were extremely worried.
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The only explanation is that the burglar must have had a duplicate key, since
					there were no signs of a forced entry. He must have sneaked in early in the
					evening, shut the door behind him, hidden himself when he heard Mr. van Daan,
					fled with the loot after Mr. van Daan went upstairs and, in his hurry, not
					bothered to shut the door.
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Who could have our key? Why didn't the burglar go to the warehouse? Was it one
					of our own warehouse employees, and will he turn us in, now that he's heard Mr.
					van Daan and maybe even seen him?
				-
			-
				Entry 121 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					It's really scary, since we don't know whether the burglar will take it into
					his head to try and get in again. Or was he so startled when he heard someone
					else in the building that he'll stay away?

					Margot and I were in the attic together today. I can't enjoy being there with
					her the way I imagine it'd be with Peter (or someone else). I know she feels
					the same about most things as I do!
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					While doing the dishes, Bep began talking to Mother and Mrs. van Daan about how
					discouraged she gets. What help did those two offer her? Our tactless mother,
					especially, only made things go from bad to worse. Do you know what her advice
					was? That she should think about all the other people in the world who are
					suffering! How can thinking about the misery of others help if you're miserable
					yourself? I said as much. Their response, of course, was that I should stay out
					of conversations of this sort.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The grown-ups are such idiots! As if Peter, Margot, Bep and I didn't all have
					the same feelings. The only thing that helps is a mother's love, or that of a
					very, very close friend. But these two mothers don't understand the first thing
					about us! Perhaps Mrs. van Daan does, a bit more than Mother. Oh, I wish I
					could have said something to poor Bep, something that I know from my own
					experience would have helped. But Father came between us, pushing me roughly
					aside. They're all so stupid!
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I also talked to Margot about Father and Mother, about how nice it could be
					here if they weren't so aggravating. We'd be able to organize evenings in which
					everyone could take turns discussing a given subject. But we've already been
					through all that. It's impossible for me to talk here! Mr. van Daan goes on the
					offensive, Mother i gets sarcastic and can't say anythina in a normal voice,
					Father doesn't feel like taking part, nor does Mr. Dussel, and Mrs. van D. is
					attacked so often that she just sits there with a red face, hardly able to put
					up a fight anymore. And what about us? We aren't allowed to have an opinion!
					My, my, aren't they progressive! Not have an opinion! People can tell you to
					shut up, but they can't keep you from having an opinion. You can't forbid
					someone to have an opinion, no matter how young they are! The only thing that
					would help Bep, Margot, Peter and me would be great love and devotion, which we
					don't get here. And no one, especially not the idiotic sages around here, is
					capable of understanding us, since we're more sensitive and much more advanced
					in our thinking than any of them ever suspect!
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Love, what is love? I don't think you can really put it into words. Love is
					understanding someone, caring for him, sharing his joys and sorrows. This
					eventually includes physical love. You've shared something, given something
					away and received something in return, whether or not you're married, whether
					or not you have a baby. Losing your virtue doesn't matter, as long as you know
					that for as long as you live you'll have someone at your side who understands
					you, and who doesn't have to be shared with anyone else!

					I managed to get hold of Peter this afternoon, and we talked for at least
					forty-five minutes. He wanted to tell me something about himself, but didn't
					find it easy. He finally got it out, though it took a long time. I honestly
					didn't know whether it was better for me to stay or to go. But I wanted so much
					to help him! I told him about Bep and how tactless our mothers are. He told me
					that his parents fight constantly, about politics and cigarettes and all kinds
					of things. As I've told you before, Peter's very shy, but not too shy to admit
					that he'd be perfectly happy not to see his parents for a year or two. "My
					father isn't as nice as he looks," he said. "But in the matter of the
					cigarettes, Mother's absolutely right."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I also told him about my mother. But he came to Father's defense. He thought he
					was a "terrific guy."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Tonight when I was hanging up my apron after doing the dishes, he called me
					over and asked me not to say anything downstairs about his parents' having had
					another argument and not being on speaking terms. I promised, though I'd
					already told Margot. But I'm sure Margot won't pass it on.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					"Oh no, Peter," I said, you don't have to worry about me. I've learned not to
					blab everything I hear. I never repeat what you tell me."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					He was glad to hear that. I also told him what terrible gossips we are, and
					said, "Margot's quite right, of course, when she says I'm not being honest,
					because as much as I want to stop gossiping, there's nothing I like better than
					discussing Mr. Dussel."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					"It's good that you admit it," he said. He blushed, and his sincere compliment
					almost embarrassed me too.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					Then we talked about "upstairs" and "downstairs" some more. Peter was really
					rather surprised to hear that don't like his parents. "Peter," I said, "you
					know I'm always honest, so why shouldn't I tell you this as well? We can see
					their faults too."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					I added, "Peter, I'd really like to help you. Will you let me? You're caught in
					an awkward position, and I know, even though you don't say anything, that it
					upsets you."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					"Oh, your help is always welcome!"
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					"Maybe it'd be better for you to talk to Father. You can tell him anything, he
					won't pass it on."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					"I know, he's a real pal."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					"You like him a lot, don't you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Peter nodded, and I continued, "Well, he likes you too, you know!"
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					He looked up quickly and blushed. It was really touching to see how happy these
					few words made him.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					'You think so?" he asked.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 24
			-
				-
					"Yes," I said. "You can tell from the little things he lets slip now and then."
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 25
			-
				-
					Then Mr. van Daan came in to do some dictating.
				-
			-
				Entry 122 - THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1944: Paragraph 26
			-

					Peter's a "terrific guy," just like Father!

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					When I looked into the candle tonight, I felt calm and happy again. It seems
					Grandma is in that candle, and it's Grandma who watches over and protects me
					and makes me feel happy again. But. . . there's someone else who governs all my
					moods and that's. . . Peter. I went to get the potatoes today, and while I was
					standing on the stairway with my pan full, he asked, "What did you do during
					the lunch break?"
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I sat down on the stairs, and we began to talk. The potatoes didn't make it to
					the kitchen until five-fifteen (an hour after I'd gone to get them). Peter
					didn't say anything more about his parents! we just talked about books and
					about the past. Oh, he gazes at me with such warmth in his eyes! I don't think
					it will take much for me to fall in love with him.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					He brought the subject up this evening. I went to his room after peeling
					potatoes and remarked on how hot it was. "You can tell the temperature by
					looking at Margot and me, because we turn white when it's cold and red when
					it's hot." I said.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"In love?" he asked.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Why should I be in love?" It was a pretty silly answer (or, rather, question).
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					"Why not?" he said, and then it was time for dinner.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					What did he mean? Today I finally managed to ask him whether my chatter
					bothered him. All he said was,
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"Oh, it's fine with me!" I can't tell how much of his reply was due to shyness.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Kitty, I sound like someone who's in love and can talk about nothing but her
					dearest darling. And Peter is a darling. Will I ever be able to tell him that?
					Only if he thinks the same of me, but I'm the kind of person you have to treat
					with kid gloves, I know that all too well.
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					And he likes to be left alone, so I don't know how much he likes me. In any
					case, we're getting to know each other a little better. I wish we dared to say
					more. But who knows, maybe that time will come sooner than I think!
				-
			-
				Entry 123 - FRIDAY, MARCH 3,1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Once or twice a day he gives me a knowing glance, I wink back, and we're both
					happy. It seems crazy to talk about his being happy, and yet I have the
					overwhelming feeling he thinks the same way I do.

					Dear Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					This is the first Saturday in months that hasn't been tiresome, dreary and
					boring. The reason is Peter. This morning as I was on my way to the attic to
					hang up my apron, Father asked whether I wanted to stay and practice my French,
					and I said yes. We spoke French together for a while and I explained something
					to Peter, and then we worked on our English. Father read aloud from Dickens,
					and I was in seventh heaven, since I was sitting on Father's chair, close to
					Peter.
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I went downstairs at quarter to eleven. When I went back up at eleven-thirty,
					Peter was already waiting for me on the stairs. We talked until quarter to one.
					Whenever I leave the room, for example after a meal, and Peter has a chance and
					no one else can hear, he says, "Bye, Anne, see you later."
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Oh, I'm so happy! I wonder if he's going to fall in love with me after all? In
					any case, he's a nice boy, and you have no idea how good it is to talk to him!
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. thinks it's all right for me to talk to
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Peter, but today she asked me teasingly, "Can I trust you two up there?"
				-
			-
				Entry 124 - SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1944: Paragraph 7

					"Of course," I protested. "I take that as an insult!"

				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Ever since Peter told me about his parents, I've felt a certain sense of
					responsibthty toward him-don't you think that's strange? It's as though their
					quarrels were just as much my business as his, and yet I don't dare bring it up
					anymore, because I'm afraid it makes him uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to
					intrude, not for all the money in the world.
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I can tell by Peter's face that he ponders things just as deeply as I do. Last
					night I was annoyed when Mrs. van D. scoffed, "The thinker!" Peter flushed and
					looked embarrassed, and I nearly blew my top.
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Why don't these people keep their mouths shut?
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					You can't imagine what it's like to have to stand on the sidelines and see how
					lonely he is, without being able to do anything. I can imagine, as if I were in
					his place, how despondent he must sometimes feel at the quarrels. And about
					love. Poor Peter, he needs to be loved so much!
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					It sounded so cold when he said he didn't need any friends. Oh, he's so wrong!
					I don't think he means it. He clings to his masculinity, his solitude and his
					feigned indif- ference so he can maintain his role, so he'll never, ever have
					to show his feelings. Poor Peter, how long can he keep it up? Won't he explode
					from this superhuman effort?
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Oh, Peter, if only I could help you, if only you would let me! Together we
					could banish our loneliness, yours and mine!
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I've been doing a great deal of thinking, but not saying much. I'm happy when I
					see him, and happier still if the sun shines when we're together. I washed my
					hair yesterday, and because I knew he was next door, I was very rambunctious. I
					couldn't help it; the more quiet and serious I am on the inside, the noisier I
					get on the outside!
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Who will be the first to discover the chink in my armor?
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					It's just as well that the van Daans don't have a daughter. My conquest could
					never be so challenging, so beautiful and so nice with someone of the same sex!
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Yours, Anne M. Frank
				-
			-
				Entry 125 - MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					PS. You know I'm always honest with you, so I think I should tell you that I
					live from one encounter to the next. I keep hoping to discover that he's dying
					to see me, and I'm in raptures when I notice his bashful attempts. I think he'd
					like to be able to express himself as easily as I do; little does he know it's
					his awkwardness that I find so touching.

				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					When I think back to my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. The Anne Frank
					who enjoyed that heavenly existence was completely different from the one who
					has grown wise within these walls. Yes, it was heavenly. Five admirers on every
					street corner, twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers,
					spoiled rotten by Father and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance.
					What more could anyone ask for?
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					You're probably wondering how I could have charmed all those people. Peter says
					It s ecause I m "attractive," but that isn't it entirely. The teachers were
					amused and entertained by my clever answers, my witty remarks, my smthng face
					and my critical mind. That's all I was: a terrible flirt, coquettish and
					amusing. I had a few plus points, which kept me in everybody's good graces: I
					was hardworking, honest and generous. I would never have refused anyone who
					wanted to peek at my answers, I was magnanimous with my candy, and I wasn't
					stuck-up.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Would all that admiration eventually have made me overconfident? It's a good
					thing that, at the height of my glory, I was suddenly plunged into reality. It
					took me more than a year to get used to doing without admiration.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					How did they see me at school? As the class comedian, the eternal ringleader,
					never in a bad mood, never a crybaby. Was it any wonder that everyone wanted to
					bicycle to school with me or do me little favors?
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but superficial girl,
					who has nothing to do with me. What did Peter say about me? "Whenever I saw
					you, you were surrounded by a flock of girls and at least two boys, you were
					always laughing, and you were always the center of attention!" He was right.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					What's remained of that Anne Frank? Oh, I haven't forgotten how to laugh or
					toss off a remark, I'm just as good, if not better, at raking people over the
					coals, and I can still flirt and be amusing, if I want to be . . .
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					But there's the catch. I'd like to live that seemingly carefree and happy life
					for an evening, a few days, a week. At the end of that week I'd be exhausted,
					and would be grateful to the first person to talk to me about something
					meaningful. I want friends, not admirers. Peo- pie who respect me for my
					character and my deeds, not my flattering smile. The circle around me would be
					much smaller, but what does that matter, as long as they're sincere?
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					In spite of everything, I wasn't altogether happy in 1942; I often felt I'd
					been deserted, but because I was on the go all day long, I didn't think about
					it. I enjoyed myself as much as I could, trying consciously or unconsciously to
					fill the void with jokes.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Looking back, I realize that this period of my life has irrevocably come to a
					close; my happy-go-lucky, carefree schooldays are gone forever. I don't even
					miss them. I've outgrown them. I can no longer just kid around, since my
					serious side is always there.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I see my life up to New Year's 1944 as if I were looking through a powerful
					magnifying glass. When I was at home, my life was filled with sunshine. Then,
					in the middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels, the
					accusations — I couldn't take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only
					way I knew to keep my bearings was to talk back.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					The first half of 1943 brought crying spells, loneliness and the gradual
					realization of my faults and short- comings, which were numerous and seemed
					even more so. I filled the day with chatter, tried to draw Pirn closer to me
					and failed. This left me on my own to face the difficult task of improving
					myself so I wouldn't have to hear their reproaches, because they made me so
					despondent.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					The second half of the year was slightly better. I became a teenager, and was
					treated more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to write
					stories, finally coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had
					anything to do with me. They had no right to swing me back and forth like a
					pendulum on a clock. I wanted to change myself in my own way. I realized I
					could man- age without my mother, completely and totally, and that hurt. But
					what affected me even more was the realization that I was never going to be
					able to confide in Father. I didn't trust anyone but myself.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					After New Year's the second big change occurred: my dream, through which I
					discovered my longing for ... a boy; not for a girlfriend, but for a boyfriend.
					I also discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial and cheerful
					exterior. From time to time I was quiet. Now I live only for Peter, since what
					happens to me in the future depends largely on him!
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					I lie in bed at night, after ending my prayers with the words "Ich Janke air
					fur all das Cute una Liebe una Schone,"* [* Thank you, God, for all that is
					good and dear and beautiful.] and I'm filled with joy. I think of going into
					hiding, my health and my whole being as das Cute; Peter's love (which is still
					so new and fragile and which neither of us dares to say aloud), the future,
					happiness and love as das Liebe; the world, nature and the tremendous beauty of
					everything, all that splendor, as das Schone.
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					At such moments I don't think about all the misery, but about the beauty that
					still remains. This is where Mother and I differ greatly. Her advice in the
					face of melancholy is: "Think about all the suffering in the world and be
					thankful you're not part of it." My advice is: "Go outside, to the country,
					enjoy the sun and all nature has to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the
					happiness within yourself; think of all the beauty in yourself and in
					everything around you and be happy."
				-
			-
				Entry 126 - TUESDAY, MARCH 7,1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					I don't think Mother's advice can be right, because what are you supposed to do
					if you become part of the suffering? You'd be completely lost. On the contrary,
					beauty remains, even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more
					and more happiness and regain your balance. A person who's happy will make
					others happy; a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery!

			-
				Entry 127 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Anne: It's strange, but I can only remember the day after what has happened the
					night before. For example, I suddenly remembered that Mr. Dussel was snoring
					loudly last night. (It's now quarter to three on Wednesday af- ternoon and Mr.
					Dussel is snoring again, which is why it flashed through my mind, of course.)
					When I had to use the potty, I deliberately made more noise to get the snoring
					to stop.
				-

					Margot: Which is better, the snoring or the gasping for air?
				-
			-

				-
					What I didn't write to Margot, but what I'll confess to you, dear Kitty, is
					that I've been dreaming of Peter a great deal. The night before last I dreamed
					I was skating right here in our living room with that little boy from the
					Apollo ice-skating rink; he was with his sister, the girl with the spindly legs
					who always wore the same blue dress. I introduced myself, overdoing it a bit,
					and asked him his name. It was Peter. In my dream I wondered just how many
					Peters I actually knew!
				-
			-
				Entry 127 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Then I dreamed we were standing in Peter's room, facing each other beside the
					stairs. I said something to him; he gave me a kiss, but replied that he didn't
					love me all that much and that I shouldn't flirt. In a desperate and pleading
					voice I said, "I'm not flirting, Peter!"
				-
			-
				Entry 127 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					When I woke up, I was glad Peter hasn't said it after all.
				-
			-
				Entry 127 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Last night I dreamed we were kissing each other, but Peter's cheeks were very
					disappointing: they weren't as soft as they looked. They were more like
					Father's cheeks — the cheeks of a man who already shaves.

					caught cold in the Westerkerk, where the service was held. Second, Mr. Kleiman
					hasn't returned to work since the last time his stomach started bleeding, so
					Bep's been left to hold down the fort alone. Third, the police have arrested a
					man (whose name I won't put in writing). It's terrible not only for him, but
					for us as well, since he's been supplying us with potatoes, butter and jam. Mr.
					M., as I'll call him, has five children under the age of thirteen, and another
					on the way.

					Lately I haven't been at all in the mood to write down what's been going on

					Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I was in Peter's room from four-thirty to

					that I think Peter's just as pleased to see me.

			-
				-
					I haven't been able to sit still lately. I wander up- stairs and down and then
					back again. I like talking to Peter, but I'm always afraid of being a nuisance.
					He's told me a bit about the past, about his parents and about himself, but
					it's not enough, and every five minutes I wonder why I find myself longing for
					more. He used to think I was a real pain in the neck, and the feeling was
					mutual. I've changed my mind, but how do I know he's changed his? I think he
					has, but that doesn't necessarily mean we have to become the best of friends,
					although as far as I'm concerned, it would make our time here more bearable.
					But I won't let this drive me crazy. I spend enough time thinking about him and
					don't have to get you all worked up as well, simply because I'm so miserable!

					Peter hasn't looked at me since yesterday. He's been acting as if he's mad at
					me. I'm doing my best not to chase after him and to talk to him as little as
					possible, but it's not easy! What's going on, what makes him keep me at arm's
					length one minute and rush back to my side the next? Perhaps I'm imagining that
					it's worse than it really is. Perhaps he's just moody like me, and tomorrow
					everything will be all right again!

				Entry 130 - SUNDAY, MARCH 12, 1944: Paragraph 4

					I have the hardest time trying to maintain a normal facade when I'm feeling so
					wretched and sad. I have to talk, help around the house, sit with the others
					and, above all, act cheerful! Most of all I miss the outdoors and having a
					place where I can be alone for as long as I want! I think I'm getting
					everything all mixed up, Kitty, but then, I'm in a state of utter confusion: on
					the one hand, I'm half crazy with desire for him, can hardly be in the same
					room without looking at him; and on the other hand, I wonder why he should
					matter to me so much and why I can't be calm again!
				-
			-
				Entry 130 - SUNDAY, MARCH 12, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Day and night, during every waking hour, I do nothing but ask myself, "Have you
					given him enough chance to be alone? Have you been spending too much time
					upstairs? Do you talk too much about serious subjects he's not yet ready to
					talk about? Maybe he doesn't even like you? Has it all been your imagination?
					But then why has he told you so much about himself? Is he sorry he did?" And a
					whole lot more.

					Yesterday afternoon I was so worn out by the sad news from the outside that I

					think. I slept until four, but then I had to go next door. It wasn't easy,
					answering all Mother's questions and inventing an excuse to explain my nap to

					Margot is very kind and would like me to confide in her, but I can't tell her

				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					It might be amusing for you (though not for me) to hear what we're going to eat
					today. The cleaning lady is working downstairs, so at the moment I'm seated at
					the van Daans' oilcloth-covered table with a handkerchief sprinkled with
					fragrant prewar perfume pressed to my nose and mouth. You probably don't have
					the faintest idea what I'm talking about, so let me "begin at the begin- ning."
					The people who supply us with food coupons have been arrested, so we have just
					our five black-market ra- -, tion books-no coupons, no fats and oils. Since
					Miep and Mr. Kleiman are sick again, Bep can't manage the shop- ping. The food
					is wretched, and so are we. As of tomor- row, we won't have a scrap of fat,
					butter or margarine. We can't eat fried potatoes for breakfast (which we've
					been doing to save on bread), so we're having hot cereal instead, and because
					Mrs. van D. thinks we're starving, we bought some half-and-half. Lunch today
					consists of mashed potatoes and pickled kale. This explains the precautionary
					measure with the handkerchief. You wouldn't believe how much kale can stink
					when it's a few years old! The kitchen smells like a mixture of spoiled plums,
					rotten eggs and brine. Ugh, just the thought of having to eat that muck makes
					me want to throw up! Besides that, our potatoes have contracted such strange
					diseases that one out of every two buckets of pommes de terre winds up in the
					garbage. We entertain ourselves by trying to figure out which disease they've
					got, and we've reached the conclusion that they suffer from cancer, smallpox
					and measles. Honestly, being in hiding during the fourth year of the war is no
					picnic. If only the whole stinking mess were over!
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					To tell you the truth, the food wouldn't matter so much to me if life here were
					more pleasant in other ways. But that's just it: this tedious existence is
					starting to make us all disagreeable. Here are the opinions of the five
					grown-ups on the present situation (children aren't allowed to have opinions,
					and for once I'm sticking to the rules):
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mrs. van Daan: "I'd stopped wanting to be queen of the kitchen long ago. But
					sitting around doing nothing was boring, so I went back to cooking. Still, I
					can't help complaining: it's impossible to cook without oil, and all those
					disgusting smells make me sick to my stomach. Besides, what do I get in return
					for my efforts? Ingratitude and rude remarks. I'm always the black sheep: I get
					blamed for everything. What's more, it's my opinion that the war is making very
					little progress. The Germans will win in the end. I'm terrified that we're
					going to starve, and when I'm in a bad mood, I snap at everyone who comes
					near."
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Mr. van Daan: "I just smoke and smoke and smoke. Then the food, the political
					situation and Kerli's moods don't seem so bad. Kerb's a sweetheart. If I don't
					have anything to smoke, I get sick, then I need to eat meat, life becomes
					unbearable, nothing's good enough, and there's bound to be a flaming row. My
					Kerli's an idiot."
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mrs. Frank: "Food's not very important, but I'd love a slice of rye bread right
					now, because I'm so hungry. If I were Mrs. van Daan, I'd have put a stop to Mr.
					van Daan's smoking long ago. But I desperately need a cigarette now, because my
					head's in such a whirl. The van Daans are horrible people! the English may make
					a lot of mistakes, but the war is progressing. I should keep my mouth shut and
					be grateful I'm not in Poland."
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Mr. Frank: "Everything's fine, I don't need a thing. Stay calm, we've got
					plenty of time. Just give me my potatoes, and I'll be quiet. Better set aside
					some of my rations for Bep. The political situation is improving, I'm extremely
					optimistic."
				-
			-
				Entry 131 - TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1944: Paragraph 8

					Mr. Dussel: "I must complete the task I've set for myself, everything must be

					for us to get caught. Me, me, me . . . ."

					Whew! Released from the gloom and doom for a few moments! All I've been hearing

					sick, we'll be left to fend for ourselves, and if . . ."
				-

					Well, you know the rest, or at any rate I assume you're famthar enough with the

				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					The reason for all the "if s" is that Mr. Kugler has been called up for a
					six-day work detail, Bep is down with a bad cold and will probably have to stay
					home tomorrow, Miep hasn't gotten over her flu, and Mr. Kleiman's stom- ach
					bled so much he lost consciousness. What a tale of woe!
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					We think Mr. Kugler should go directly to a reliable doctor for a medical
					certificate of ill health, which he can present to the City Hall in Hilversum.
					The warehouse — employees have been given a day off tomorrow, so Bep will be
					alone in the office. If (there's another "if') Bep has to stay home, the door
					will remain locked and we'll have to be as quiet as mice so the Keg Company
					won't hear us. At one o'clock Jan will come for half an hour to check on us
					poor forsaken souls, like a zookeeper.
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					This afternoon, for the first time in ages, Jan gave us some news of the
					outside world. You should have seen us gathered around him; it looked exactly
					like a print: "At Grandmother's Knee."
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					He regaled his grateful audience with talk of-what else?-food. Mrs. P., a
					friend of Miep's, has been cooking his meals. The day before yesterday Jan ate
					carrots with green peas, yesterday he had the leftovers, today she's cooking
					marrowfat peas, and tomorrow she's plan- ning to mash the remaining carrots
					with potatoes.
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					We asked about Miep's doctor.
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"Doctor?" said Jan. "What doctor? I called him this morning and got his
					secretary on the line. I asked for a flu prescription and was told I could come
					pick it up tomor- row morning between eight and nine. If you've got a
					particularly bad case of flu, the doctor himself comes to the phone and says,
					'Stick out your tongue and say "Aah." Oh, I can hear it, your throat's
					infected. I'll write out a prescription and you can bring it to the phar- macy.
					Good day.' And that's that. Easy job he's got, diagnosis by phone. But I
					shouldn't blame the doctors." After all, a person has only two hands, and these
					days there're too many patients and too few doctors."
				-
			-
				Entry 132 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Still, we all had a good laugh at Jan's phone call. I can just imagine what a
					doctor's waiting room looks like these days. Doctors no longer turn up their
					noses at the poorer patients, but at those with minor illnesses. "Hey, what are
					you doing here?" they think. "Go to the end of the line; real patients have
					priority!"

					in a moment.
				-
			-
				Entry 133 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I now know why I'm so much more restless than Peter. He has his own room, where
					he can work, dream, think and sleep. I'm constantly being chased from one
					corner to another. I'm never alone in the room I share with Dussel, though I
					long to be so much. That's another reason I take refuge in the attic. When I'm
					there, or with you, I can be myself, at least for a little while. Still, I
					don't want to moan and groan. On the contrary, I want to be brave!
				-
			-
				Entry 133 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Thank goodness the others notice nothing of my innermost feelings, except that
					every day I'm growing cooler and more contemptuous of Mother, less affection-
					ate to Father and less willing to share a single thought with Margot; I'm
					closed up tighter than a drum. Above all, I have to maintain my air of
					confidence. No one must know that my heart and mind are constantly at war with
					each other. Up to now reason has always won the battle, but will my emotions
					get the upper hand? Sometimes I fear they will, but more often I actually hope
					they do!
				-
			-
				Entry 133 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Oh, it's so terribly hard not to talk to Peter about these things, but I know I
					have to let him begin; it's so hard to act during the daytime as if everything
					I've said and done in my dreams had never taken place! Kitty, Anne is crazy,
					but then these are crazy times and even crazier circumstances.
				-
			-
				Entry 133 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The nicest part is being able to write down all my thoughts and feelings!
					otherwise, I'd absolutely suffocate. I wonder what Peter thinks about all these
					things? I keep thinking I'll be able to talk to him about them one day. He must
					have guessed something about the inner me, since he couldn't possibly love the
					outer Anne he's known so far! How could someone like Peter, who loves peace and
					quiet, possibly stand my bustle and noise? Will he be the first and only person
					to see what's beneath my granite mask? Will it take him long? Isn't there some
					old saying about love being akin to pity? Isn't that what's happening here as
					well? Because I often pity him as much as I do myself!
				-
			-
				Entry 133 - THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I honestly don't know how to begin, I really don't, so how can I expect Peter
					to when talking is so much harder for him? If only I could write to him, then
					at least he'd know what I was trying to say, since it's so hard to say it out
					loud!

				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Everything turned out all right after all; Bep just had a sore throat, not the
					flu, and Mr. Kugler got a medical certificate to excuse him from the work
					detail. The entire Annex breathed a huge sigh of relief. Everything's fine
					here! Except that Margot and I are rather tired of our parents.
				-
			-
				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Don't get me wrong. I still love Father as much as ever and Margot loves both
					Father and Mother, but when you're as old as we are, you want to make a few
					decisions for yourself, get out from under their thumb. Whenever I go upstairs,
					they ask what I'm going to do, they won't let me salt my food, Mother asks me
					every evening at eight — fifteen if it isn't time for me to change into my
					nighty, I and they have to approve every book I read. I must admit, they're not
					at all strict about that and let me read nearly everything, but Margot and I
					are sick and tired of having to listen to their comments and questions all day
					long.
				-
			-
				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					There's something else that displeases them: I no longer feel like giving them
					little kisses morning, noon and night. All those cute nicknames seem so
					affected, and Father's fondness for talking about farting and going to the
					bathroom is disgusting. In short, I'd like nothing better than to do without
					their company for a while, and they don't understand that. Not that Margot and
					I have ever said any of this to them. What would be the point? They wouldn't
					understand anyway.
				-

				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 5

					Margot said last night, "What really bothers me is that if you happen to put

				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					For both of us, it's been quite a blow to suddenly realize that very little
					remains of the close and harmoni- ous family we used to have at home! This is
					mostly because everything's out of kilter here. By that I mean that we're
					treated like children when it comes to external matters, while, inwardly, we're
					much older than other girls our age. Even though I'm only fourteen, I know what
					I want, I know who's right and who's wrong, I have my own opinions, ideas and
					principles, and though it may sound odd coming from a teenager, I feel I'm more
					of a person than a child — I feel I'm completely independent of others. I know
					I'm better at debating or carrying on a discussion than Mother, I know I'm more
					objective, I don't exaggerate as much, I'm much tidier and better with my
					hands, and because of that I feel (this may make you laugh) that I'm superior
					to her in many ways. To love someone, I have to admire and respect the person,
					but I feel neither respect nor admiration for Mother!
				-
			-
				Entry 134 - FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 1944: Paragraph 7

					I've told you more about myself and my feelings than I've ever told a living
					soul, so why shouldn't that include sex?
				-
			-
				Entry 135 - SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Parents, and people in general, are very peculiar when it comes to sex. Instead
					of telling their sons and daughters everything at the age of twelve, they send
					the children out of the room the moment the subject arises and leave them to
					find out everything on their own. Later on, when parents notice that their
					children have, somehow, come by their information, they assume they know more
					(or less) than they actually do. So why don't they try to make amends by asking
					them what's what?
				-
			-
				Entry 135 - SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					A major stumbling block for the adults — though in my opinion it's no more than
					a pebble — is that they're afraid their children will no longer look upon
					marriage as sacred and pure once they realize that, in most cases, this purity
					is a lot of nonsense. As far as I'm concerned, it's not wrong for a man to
					bring a little experience to a marriage. After all, it has nothing to do with
					the marriage itself, does it?
				-
			-
				Entry 135 - SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Soon after I turned eleven, they told me about menstruation. But even then, I
					had no idea where the blood came from or what it was for. When I was twelve and
					a half, I learned some more from Jacque, who wasn't as ignorant as I was. My
					own intuition told me what a man and a woman do when they're together; it
					seemed like a crazy idea at first, but when Jacque confirmed it, I was proud of
					myself for having figured it out!
				-
			-
				Entry 135 - SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					It was also Jacque who told me that children didn't come out of their mother's
					tummies. As she put it, "Where the ingredients go in is where the finished
					product comes out!" Jacque and I found out about the hymen, and quite a few
					other details, from a book on sex education. I also knew that you could keep
					from having children, but how that worked inside your body remained a mystery.
					When I came here, Father told me about prostitutes, etc., but all in all there
					are still unanswered questions.

				-
					Yesterday was a very important day for me. After lunch everything was as usual.
					At five I put on the potatoes, and Mother gave me some blood sausage to take to
					Peter. I didn't want to at first, but I finally went. He wouldn't accept the
					sausage, and I had the dreadful feel- ing it was still because of that argument
					we'd had about distrust. Suddenly I couldn't bear it a moment longer and my
					eyes filled with tears. Without another word, I re- turned the platter to
					Mother and went to the bathroom to have a good cry. Afterward I decided to talk
					things out with Peter. Before dinner the four of us were helping him with a
					crossword puzzle, so I couldn't say anything. But as we were sitting down to
					eat, I whispered to him, "Are you going to practice your shorthand tonight,
					Peter?"

			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					"No," was his reply.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"I'd like to talk to you later on."
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					He agreed.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					After the dishes were done, I went to his room and asked if he'd refused the
					sausage because of our last quar- rel. Luckily, that wasn't the reason; he just
					thought it was bad manners to seem so eager. It had been very hot downstairs
					and my face was as red as a lobster. So after taking down some water for
					Margot, I went back up to get a little fresh air. For the sake of appearances,
					I first went and stood beside the van Daans' window before going to Peter's
					room. He was standing on the left side of the open window, so I went over to
					the right side. It's much easier to talk next to an open window in semidarkness
					than in broad daylight, and I think Peter felt the same way. We told each other
					so much, so very much, that I can't repeat it all. But it felt good; it was the
					most won- derful evening I've ever had in the Annex. I'll give you a brief
					description of the various subjects we touched on.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					First we talked about the quarrels and how I see them in a very different light
					these days, and then about how we've become alienated from our parents. I told
					Peter about Mother and Father and Margot and myself. At one point he asked,
					"You always give each other a good-night kiss, don't you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					"One? Dozens of them. You don't, do you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"No, I've never really kissed anyone."
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					'Not even on your birthday?"
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					'Yeah, on my birthday I have.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					We talked about how neither of us really trusts our parents, and how his
					parents love each other a great deal and wish he'd confide in them, but that he
					doesn't want to.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					How I cry my heart out in bed and he goes up to the loft and swears. How Margot
					and I have only recently gotten to know each other and yet still tell each
					other very little, since we're always together. We talked about every
					imaginable thing, about trust, feelings and ourselves. Oh, Kitty, he was just
					as I thought he would be.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Then we talked about the year 1942, and how different we were back then; we
					don't even recognize ourselves from that period. How we couldn't stand each
					other at first. He'd thought I was a noisy pest, and I'd quickly concluded that
					he was nothing special. I didn't understand why he didn't flirt with me, but
					now I'm glad. He also mentioned how he often used to retreat to his room. I
					said that my noise and exuberance and his silence were two sides of the same
					coin, and that I also liked peace and quiet but don't have anything for myself
					alone, except my diary, and that everyone would rather see the back of me,
					starting with Mr. Dussel, and that I don't always want to sit with my parents.
					We discussed how glad he is that my parents have children and how glad I am
					that he's here.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					How I now understand his need to withdraw and his relationship to his parents,
					and how much I'd like to help him when they argue.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					"But you're always a help to me!" he said.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					"How?" I asked, greatly surprised.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					"By being cheerful."
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					That was the nicest thing he said all evening. He also told me that he didn't
					mind my coming to his room the way he used to; in fact, he liked it. I also
					told him that all of Father's and Mother's pet names were meaningless, that a
					kiss here and there didn't automatically lead to trust. We also talked about
					doing things your own way, the diary, loneliness, the difference between
					everyone's inner and outer selves, my mask, etc.
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					It was wonderful. He must have come to love me as a friend, and, for the time
					being, that's enough. I'm so grateful and happy, I can't find the words. I must
					apolo- gize, Kitty, since my style is not up to my usual standard today. I've
					just written whatever came into my head!
				-
			-
				Entry 136 - SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret. Whenever he looks at me
					with those eyes, with that smile and that wink, it's as if a light goes on
					inside me. I hope things will stay like this and that we'll have many, many
					more happy hours together.

				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					This morning Peter asked me if I'd come again one evening. He swore I wouldn't
					be disturbing him, and said that where there was room for one, there was room
					for two. I said I couldn't see him every evening, since my parents didn't think
					it was a good idea, but he thought I shouldn't let that bother me. So I told
					him I'd like to come some Saturday evening and also asked him if he'd let me
					know when you could see the moon.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					"Sure," he said, "maybe we can go downstairs and look at the moon from there."
					I agreed; I'm not really so scared of burglars.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					In the meantime, a shadow has fallen on my happiness. For a long time I've had
					the feeling that Margot likes Peter. Just how much I don't know, but the whole
					situation is very unpleasant. Now every time I go see Peter I'm hurting her,
					without meaning to.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					The funny thing is that she hardly lets it show. I know I'd be insanely
					jealous, but Margot just says I shouldn't feel sorry for her.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"I think it's so awful that you've become the odd one out," I added.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					"I'm used to that," she replied, somewhat bitterly.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I don't dare tell Peter. Maybe later on, but he and I need to discuss so many
					other things first.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Mother slapped me last night, which I deserved. I mustn't carry my indifference
					and contempt for her too far. In spite of everything, I should try once again
					to be friendly and keep my remarks to myself!
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Even Pirn isn't as nice as he used to be. He's been trying not to treat me like
					a child, but now he's much too cold. We'll just have to see what comes of it!
					He's warned me that if I don't do my algebra, I won't get any tutoring after
					the war. I could simply wait and see what happens, but I'd like to start again,
					provided I get a new book.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					That's enough for now. I do nothing but gaze at Peter, and I'm filled to
					overflowing!

					Evidence of Margot's goodness. I received this today, March 20, 1944:
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Anne, yesterday when I said I wasn't jeal- ous of you, I wasn't being entirely
					honest.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					The situation is this: I'm not jealous of either you or Peter. I'm just sorry I
					haven't found anyone willi whom to share my thoughts and feelings, and I'm not
					likely to in the near future. But that's why I wish, from the bottom of my
					heart, that you will both be able to place your trust in each other. You're
					already missing out on so much here, things other people take for granted.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					On the other hand, I'm certain I'd never have gotten as far with Peter, because
					I think I'd need to feel very close to a person before I could share my
					thoughts. I'd want to have the feeling that he understood me through and
					through, even if I didn't say much. For this reason it would have to be someone
					I felt was intellectually superior to me, and that isn't the case with Peter.
					But I can imagine your feeling close to him.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					So there's no need for you to reproach yourself because you think you' te
					taking something I was entitled to: nothing could be further from the truth.
					You and Peter have everything to gain by your friendship.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					My answer:
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					Dearest Margot,
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					Your letter was extremely kind, but I still don't feel completely happy about
					the situation, and I don't think I ever will.
				-
			-
				Entry 137 - MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					At the moment, Peter and I don't trust each other as much as you seem to think.
					It's just that when you're standing beside an open window at twthght, you can
					say more to each other than in bright sunshine. It's also easier to whisper
					your feelings than to shout them from the rooftops. I think you've begun to
					feel a kind of sisterly affection for Peter and would like to help him, just as
					much as I would. Perhaps you'll be able to do that someday, though that's not
					the kind of trust we have in mind. I believe that trust has to corne from both
					sides; I also think that's the reason why Father and I have never really grown
					so close. But let's not talk about it anymore. If there's anything you still
					want to discuss, please write, because it's easier for me to say what I mean as
					on paper than face-to-face. You know how le much I admire you, and only hope
					that some of your goodness and Father's goodness will rub off on me, because,
					in that sense, you two are a lot alike.

				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I received this letter last night from Margot:
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Dear Anne,
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					After your letter of yesterday I have the unpleasant feeling that your
					conscience bothers you whenever you go to Peter's to work or talk: there's
					really no reason for that. In my heart, I know there's someone who deserves t
					my trust (as I do his), and I wouldn't be able to tolerate Peter in his place.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					However, as you wrote, I do think of Peter as a kind of brother. . . a younger
					brother: we've been sending out feelers, and a brotherly and sisterly affection
					mayor may not develop at some later date, but it's certainly not reached that
					stage yet. So there's no need for you to feel sorry for me. Now that you've
					found companionship, enjoy it as much as you can.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					In the meantime, things are getting more and more wonderful here. I think,
					Kitty, that true love may be developing in the Annex. All those jokes about
					marrying Peter if we stayed here long enough weren't so silly after all. Not
					that I'm thinking of marrying him, mind you. I don't even know what he'll be
					like when he grows up. Or if we'll even love each other enough to get married.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I'm sure now that Peter loves me tool I just don't know in what way. I can't
					figure out if he wants only a good friend, or if he's attracted to me as a girl
					or as a sister. When he said I always helped him when his parents were arguing,
					I was tremendously happy: it was one step toward making me believe in his
					friendship. I asked him yesterday what he'd do if there were a dozen Annes who
					kept popping in to see him. His answer was: "If they were all like you, it
					wouldn't be so bad." He's extremely hospitable, and I think he really likes to
					see me. Mean- while, he's been working hard at learning French, even studying
					in bed until ten- fifteen.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Oh, when I think back to Saturday night, to our words, our voices, I feel
					satisfied with myself for the very first time! what I mean is, I'd still say
					the same and wouldn't want to change a thing, the way I usually do. He's so
					handsome, whether he's smthng or just sitting still. He's so sweet and good and
					beautiful. I think what surprised him most about me was when he discovered that
					I'm not at all the superficial, worldly Anne I appear to be, but a dreamer,
					like he is, with just as many troubles!
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Last night after the dinner dishes, I waited for him to ask me to stay
					upstairs. But nothing happened; I went away. He came downstairs to tell Dussel
					it was time to listen to the radio and hung around the bathroom for a while,
					but when Dussel took too long, he went back upstairs. He paced up and down his
					room and went to bed early.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					The entire evening I was so restless I kept going to the bathroom to splash
					cold water on my face. I read a bit, daydreamed some more, looked at the clock
					and waited, waited, waited, all the while listening to his foot- steps. I went
					to bed early, exhausted.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Tonight I have to take a bath, and tomorrow?
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 12

				-
					My answer:
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					Dearest Margot,
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					I think the best thing is simply to wait and see what happens. It can't be much
					longer before Peter and I will have to decide whether to go back to the way we
					were or do some- thing else. I don't know how it'll turn out; I can't see any
					farther than the end of my nose.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					But I'm certain of one thing: if Peter and I do become friends, I'm going to
					tell him you're also very fond of him and are prepared to help him if he needs
					you. You wouldn't want me to, I'm sure, but I don't care; I don't know what
					Peter thinks of you, but I'll ask him when the time comes. It's certainly
					nothing bad — on the contrary! You're welcome to join us in the attic, or
					wherever we are. You won't be disturbing us, because we have an unspoken
					agreement to talk only in the evenings when it's dark.
				-
			-
				Entry 138 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22,1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Keep your spirits up! I'm doing my best, though it's not always easy. Your time
					may come sooner than you think.

					Miep's been back since yesterday, but today it was her husband's turn to take

					Yesterday a plane crashed nearby. The crew was able to parachute out in time.
					It crashed on top of a school, but luckily there were no children inside. There
					was a small fire and a couple of people were killed. As the airmen made their
					descent, the Germans sprayed them with bullets. The Amsterdammers who saw it
					seethed with rage at such a dastardly deed. We-by which I mean the ladies-were
					also scared out of our wits. Brrr, I hate the sound of gunfire.

				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					I was with Peter yesterday and, somehow, I honestly don't know how, we wound up
					talking about sex. I'd made up my mind a long time ago to ask him a few things.
					He knows everything; when I said that Margot and I weren't very well informed,
					he was amazed. I told him a lot about Margot and me and Mother and Father and
					said that lately I didn't dare ask them anything. He offered to enlighten me,
					and I gratefully accepted: he described how contraceptives work, and I asked
					him very boldly how boys could tell they were grown up. He had to think about
					that one; he said he'd tell me tonight. I told him what had happened to Jacque,
					and said that girls are defenseless against strong boys. "Well, you don't have
					to be afraid of me," he said.
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					When I came back that evening, he told me how it is with boys. Slightly
					embarrassing, but still awfully nice to be able to discuss it with him. Neither
					he nor I had ever imagined we'd be able to talk so openly to a girl or a boy,
					respectively, about such intimate matters. I think I know everything now. He
					told me a lot about what he called Prasentivmitteln* [* Should be
					Praservativmitteln: prophylactics] in German.
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					That night in the bathroom Margot and I were talking about Bram and Trees, two
					friends of hers.
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					This morning I was in for a nasty surprise: after breakfast Peter beckoned me
					upstairs. "That was a dirty trick you played on me," he said. "I heard what you
					and Margot were saying in the bathroom last night. I think you just wanted to
					find out how much Peter knew and then have a good laugh!"
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I was stunned! I did everything I could to talk him out of that outrageous
					idea; I could understand how he must have felt, but it just wasn't true!
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					"Oh no, Peter," I said. "I'd never be so mean. I told you I wouldn't pass on
					anything you said to me and I won't. To put on an act like that and then
					deliberately be so mean. . . No, Peter, that's not my idea ofa joke.
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					It wouldn't be fair. I didn't say anything, honest. Won't you believe me?" He
					assured me he did, but I think we'll have to talk about it again sometime. I've
					done nothing all day but worry about it. Thank goodness he came right out and
					said what was on his mind. Imagine if he'd gone around thinking I could be that
					mean. He's so sweet!
				-
			-
				Entry 139 - THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1944: Paragraph 13

					Dear Kitty,

			-
				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I often go up to Peter's room after dinner nowadays to breathe in the fresh
					evening air. You can get around to meaningful conversations more quickly in the
					dark than with the sun tickling your face. It's cozy and snug sitting beside
					him on a chair and looking outside. The van Daans and Dussel make the silliest
					remarks when I disappear into his room. "Annes zweite Heimat,"* [* Anne's
					second home] they say, or "Is it proper for a gentleman to receive young girls
					in his room at night with the lights out?" Peter has amazing presence of mind
					in the face of these so-called witticisms. My mother, incidentally, is also
					bursting with curiosity and simply dying to ask what we talk about, only she's
					secretly afraid I'd refuse to answer. Peter says the grown-ups are just jealous
					because we're young and that we shouldn't take their obnoxious comments to
					heart.

					Sometimes he comes downstairs to get me, but that's awkward too, because in
					spite of all his precautions his face turns bright red and he can hardly get
					the words out of his mouth. I'm glad I don't blush; it must be extremely
					unpleasant.

					Besides, it bothers me that Margot has to sit downstairs all by herself, while
					I'm upstairs enjoying Peter's company. But what can I do about it? I wouldn't
					mind it if she came, but she'd just be the odd one out, sitting there like a
					lump on a log.

				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I've had to listen to countless remarks about our sudden friendship. I can't
					tell you how often the conversation at meals has been about an Annex wedding,
					should the war last another five years. Do we take any notice of this parental
					chitchat? Hardly, since it's all so silly. Have my parents forgotten that they
					were young once? Apparently they have. At any rate, they laugh at us when we're
					serious, and they're serious when we're joking.

				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 6

				-
					I don't know what's going to happen next, or whether we'll run out of things to
					say. But if it goes on like this, we'll eventually be able to be together
					without talking. If only his parents would stop acting so strangely. It's
					probably because they don't like seeing me so often; Peter and I certainly
					never tell them what we talk about. Imagine if they knew we were discussing
					such intimate things.
				-
			-
				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I'd like to ask Peter whether he knows what girls look like down there. I don't
					think boys are as complicated as girls. You can easily see what boys look like
					in photographs or pictures of male nudes, but with women it's different. In
					women, the genitals, or whatever they're called, are hidden between their legs.
					Peter has probably never seen a girl up close. To tell you the truth, neither
					have I. Boys are a lot easier. How on earth would I go about describing a
					girl's parts? I can tell from what he said that he doesn't know exactly how it
					all fits together. He was talking about the "Muttermund," [* cervix], but
					that's on the inside, where you can't see it. Everything's pretty well arranged
					in us women. Until I was eleven or twelve, I didn't realize there was a second
					set of labia on the inside, since you couldn't see them. What's even funnier is
					that I thought urine came out of the clitoris. I asked Mother one time what
					that little bump was, and she said she didn't know. She can really play dumb
					when she wants to!
				-
			-
				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					But to get back to the subject. How on earth can you explain what it all looks
					like without any models?
				-
			-
				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Shall I try anyway? Okay, here goes!
				-
			-
				Entry 140 - FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					When you're standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs
					there are two soft, cushiony things, also covered with hair, which press
					together when you're standing, so you can't see what's inside. They separate
					when you sit down, and they're very red and quite fleshy on the inside. In the
					upper part, between the outer labia, there's a fold of skin that, on second
					thought, looks like a kind of blister. That's the clitoris. Then come the inner
					labia, which are also pressed together in a kind of crease. When they open up,
					you can see a fleshy little mound, no bigger than the top of my thumb. The
					upper part has a couple of small holes in it, which is where the urine comes
					out. The lower part looks as if it were just skin, and yet that's where the
					vagina is. You can barely find it, because the folds of skin hide the opening.
					The hole's so small I can hardly imagine how a man could get in there, much
					less how a baby could come out. It's hard enough trying to get your index
					finger inside. That's all there is, and yet it plays such an important role!

				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					You never realize how much you've changed until after it's happened. I've
					changed quite drastically, everything about me is different: my opinions,
					ideas, critical outlook. Inwardly, outwardly, nothing's the same. And, I might
					safely add, since it's true, I've changed for the better. I once told you that,
					after years of being adored, it was hard for me to adjust to the harsh reality
					of grown-ups and rebukes. But Father and Mother are largely to blame for my
					having to put up with so much. At home they wanted me to enjoy life, which was
					fine, but here they shouldn't have encouraged me to agree with them and only
					shown me "their" side of all the quarrels and gossip. It was a long time before
					I discovered the score was fifty-fifty. I now know that many blunders have been
					committed here, by young and old alike. Father and Mother's biggest mistake in
					dealing with the van Daans is that they're never candid and friendly
					(admittedly, the friendliness might have to be feigned). Above all, I want to
					keep the peace, and to neither quarrel nor gossip. With Father and Margot
					that's not difficult, but it is with Mother, which is why I'm glad she gives me
					an occasional rap on the knuckles. You can win Mr. van Daan to your side by
					agreeing with him, listening quietly, not saying much and most of all . . .
					responding to his teasing and his corny jokes with a joke of your own. Mrs. van
					D. can be won over by talking openly to her and admitting when you're wrong.
					She also frankly admits her faults, of which she has many. I know all too well
					that she doesn't think as badly of me as she did in the beginning. And that's
					simply because I'm honest and tell people right to their faces what I think,
					even when it's not very flattering. I want to be honest; I think it gets you
					further and also makes you feel better about yourself.

				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 3

					Yesterday Mrs. van D. was talking about the rice we gave Mr. Kleiman. "All we
					do is give, give, give. But at a certain point I think that enough is enough.
					If he'd only take the trouble, Mr. Kleiman could scrounge up his own rice. Why
					should we give away all our supplies? We need them just as badly."
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"No, Mrs. van Daan," I replied. "I don't agree with you. Mr. Kleiman may very
					well be able to get hold of a little rice, but he doesn't like having to worry
					about it. It's not our place to criticize the people who are helping us. We
					should give them whatever they need if we can possibly spare it. One less plate
					of rice a week won't make that much difference; we can always eat beans."
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 5

				-
					Mrs. van D. didn't see it my way, but she added that, even though she

					matter.
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Well, I've said enough. Sometimes I know what my place is and sometimes I have
					my doubts, but I'll eventually get where I want to be! I know I will!
					Especially now that I have help, since Peter helps me through many a rough
					patch and rainy day!
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I honestly don't know how much he loves me and whether we'll ever get as far as
					a kiss; in any case, I don't want to force the issue! I told Father I often go
					see Peter and asked if he approved, and of course he did!
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					It's much easier now to tell Peter things I'd nor- mally keep to myself; for

					write in addition to my work.
				-
			-
				Entry 141 - SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1944: Paragraph 9

					I don't have much in the way of money or worldly possessions, I'm not

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					At least one long chapter on our life in hiding should be about politics, but
					I've been avoiding the subject, since it interests me so little. Today,
					however, I'll devote an entire letter to politics.
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Of course, there are many different opinions on this topic, and it's not
					surprising to hear it frequently discussed in times of war, but. . . arguing so
					much about politics is just plain stupid! Let them laugh, swear, make bets,
					grumble and do whatever they want as long as they stew in their own juice. But
					don't let them argue, since that only makes things worse. The people who come
					from outside bring us a lot of news that later proves to be untrue; however, up
					to now our radio has never lied. Jan, Miep, Mr. Kleiman, Bep and Mr. Kugler go
					up and down in their political moods, though Jan least of all.
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Here in the Annex the mood never varies. The end- less debates over the
					invasion, air raids, speeches, etc., etc., are accompanied by countless
					exclamations such as "Eempossible!, Urn Gottes Widen* [* Oh, for heaven's
					sake]. If they're just getting started now, how long is it going to last!, It's
					going splendidly, But, great!"
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Optimists and pessimists — not to mention the realists — air their opinions
					with unflagging energy, and as with everything else, they're all certain that
					they have a monopoly on the truth. It annoys a certain lady that her spouse has
					such supreme faith in the British, and a certain husband attacks his wife
					because of her teasing and dispar- aging remarks about his beloved nation!
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					And so it goes from early in the morning to late at night; the funny part is
					that they never get tired of it. I've discovered a trick, and the effect is
					overwhelming, just like pricking someone with a pin and watching them jump.
					Here's how it works: I start talking about politics.
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 7

					All it takes is a single question, a word or a sentence, and before you know
					it, the entire family is involved!
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					As if the German "Wehrmacht News" and the English BBC weren't enough, they've
					now added special air-raid announcements. In a word, splendid. But the other
					side of the coin is that the British Air Force is operating around the clock.
					Not unlike the German propaganda machine, which is cranking out lies
					twenty-four hours a day!
				-
			-
				Entry 142 - MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					So the radio is switched on every morning at eight (if not earlier) and is
					listened to every hour until nine, ten or even eleven at night. This is the
					best evidence yet that the adults have infinite patience, but also that their
					brains have turned to mush (some of them, I mean, since I wouldn't want to
					insult anyone). One broadcast, two at the most, should be enough to last the
					entire day. But no, those old nincompoops. . . never mind, I've already said it
					all! "Music While You Work," the Dutch broadcast from England, Frank Phillips
					or Queen Wilhelmina, they each get a turn and find a willing listener. If the
					adults aren't eating or sleeping, they're clustered around the radio talking
					about eating, sleeping and politics. Whew! It's getting to be a bore, and it's
					all I can do to keep from turning into a dreary old crone myself! Though with
					all the old folks around me, that might not be such a bad idea!

					Dussel sits to the left of the radio, Mr. van D. in front of it and Peter to
					the side. Mother is next to Mr. van D., willi Mrs. van D. behind them. Margot
					and I are sitting in the last row and Pirn at the table. I realize this isn't a
					very clear description of our seating arrangements, but it doesn't matter. The
					men smoke, Peter's eyes close from the strain of listening, Mama is dressed in
					her long, dark negligee, Mrs. van D. is trembling because of the planes, which
					take no notice of the speech but fly blithely on toward Essen, Father is
					slurping his tea, and Margot and I are united in a sisterly way by the sleeping
					Mouschi, who has taken possession of both our knees. Margot's hair is in
					curlers and my nightgown is too small, too tight and too short. It all looks so
					intimate, cozy and peaceful, and for once it really is. Yet I await the end of
					the speech willi dread. They're impatient, straining at the leash to start
					another argument! Pst, pst, like a cat luring a mouse from its hole, they goad
					each other into quarrels and dissent.

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					As much as I'd like to write more on politics, I have lots of other news to
					report today. First, Mother has virtually forbidden me to go up to Peter's,
					since, according to her, Mrs. van Daan is jealous. Second, Peter's invited
					Margot to join us upstairs. Whether he really means it or is just saying it out
					of politeness, I don't know. Third, I asked Father if he thought I should take
					any notice of Mrs. van Daan's jealousy and he said I didn't have to.
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					What should I do now? Mother's angry, doesn't want me going upstairs, wants me
					to go back to doing my homework in the room I share willi Dussel. She may be
					jealous herself. Father doesn't begrudge us those few hours and thinks it's
					nice we get along so well. Margot likes Peter too, but feels that three people
					can't talk about the same things as two.
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Furthermore, Mother thinks Peter's in love with me. To tell you the truth, I
					wish he were. Then we'd be even, and it'd be a lot easier to get to know each
					other. She also claims he's always looking at me. Well, I suppose we do give
					each other the occasional wink. But I can't help it if he keeps admiring my
					dimples, can I?
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I'm in a very difficult position. Mother's against me and I'm against her.
					Father turns a blind eye to the silent struggle between Mother and me. Mother
					is sad, because she still loves me, but I'm not at all unhappy, because she no
					longer means anything to me.
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					As for Peter. . . I don't want to give him up. He's so sweet and I admire him
					so much. He and I could have a really beautiful relationship, so why are the
					old folks poking their noses into our business again? Fortu- nately, I'm used
					to hiding my feelings, so I manage not to show how crazy I am about him. Is he
					ever going to say anything? Am I ever going to feel his cheek against mine, the
					way I felt Petel's cheek in my dream? Oh, Peter and
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Petel, you're one and the same! They don't understand us; they'd never
					understand that we're content just to sit beside each other and not say a word.
					They have no idea of what draws us together! Oh, when will we overcome all
					these difficulties? And yet it's good that we have to surmount them, since it
					makes the end that much more beautiful. When he lays his head on his arms and
					closes his eyes, he's still a child; when he plays with Mouschi or talks about
					her, he's loving; when he carries the potatoes or other heavy loads, he's
					strong; when he goes to watch the gunfire or walks through the dark house to
					look for burglars, he's brave; and when he's so awkward and clumsy, he's
					hopelessly endearing. It's much nicer when he explains something to me than
					when I have to teach him. I wish he were superior to me in nearly every way!
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 8

				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 9

					Father always says I'm conceited, but I'm not, I'm merely vain! I haven't had
					many people tell me I was pretty, except for a boy at school who said I looked
					so cute when I smiled. Yesterday Peter paid me a true com- pliment, and just
					for fun I'll give you a rough idea of our conversation.
				-
			-
				Entry 143 - TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1944: Paragraph 10

				-

				Entry 144 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mr. Bolkestein, the Cabinet Minister, speaking on the Dutch broadcast from
					London, said that after the war a collection would be made of diaries and
					letters dealing with the war. Of course, everyone pounced on my diary. Just
					imagine how interesting it would be if I were to publish a novel about the
					Secret Annex. The title alone would make people think it was a detective story.
				-
			-
				Entry 144 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Seriously, though, ten years after the war people would find it very amusing to
					read how we lived, what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hiding.
					Although I tell you a great deal about our lives, you still know very little
					about us. How frightened the women are during air raids; last Sunday, for
					instance, when 350 British planes dropped 550 tons of bombs on IJmuiden, so
					that the houses trembled like blades of grass in the wind. Or how many
					epidemics are raging here.
				-
			-
				Entry 144 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					You know nothing of these matters, and it would take me all day to describe
					everything down to the last detail. People have to stand in line to buy
					vegetables and all kinds of goods; doctors can't visit their patients, since
					their cars and bikes are stolen the moment they turn their backs; burglaries
					and thefts are so common that you ask yourself what's suddenly gotten into the
					Dutch to make them so light-fingered. Little children, eight- and eleven-
					year-olds, smash the windows of people's homes and steal whatever they can lay
					their hands on. People don't dare leave the house for even five minutes, since
					they're liable to come back and find all their belongings gone. Every day the
					newspapers are filled with reward notices for the return of stolen typewriters,
					Persian rugs, electric clocks, fabrics, etc. The electric clocks on street
					corners are dismantled, public phones are stripped down to the last wire.
				-
			-
				Entry 144 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Morale among the Dutch can't be good. Everyone's hungry; except for the ersatz
					coffee, a week's food ration doesn't last two days. The invasion's long in
					coming, the men are being shipped off to Germany, the children are sick or
					undernourished, everyone's wearing worn-out clothes and run-down shoes. A new
					sole costs 7.50 guil- ders on the black market. Besides, few shoemakers will do
					repairs, or if they do, you have to wait four months for your shoes, which
					might very well have disappeared in the meantime.
				-
			-
				Entry 144 - WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					One good thing has come out of this: as the food gets worse and the decrees
					more severe, the acts of sabo- tage against the authorities are increasing. The
					ration board, the police, the officials— they're all either helping their
					fellow citizens or denouncing them and sending them off to prison. Fortunately,
					only a small percentage of Dutch people are on the wrong side.

					Just imagine, it's still fairly cold, and yet most people have been without
					coal for nearly a month. Sounds awful, doesn't it? There's a general mood of
					optimism about the Russian front, because that's going great guns! I don't
					often write about the political situation, but I must tell you where the
					Russians are at the moment. They've reached the Polish border and the Prut
					River in Romania. They're close to Odessa, and they've surrounded Ternopol.

					they simply don't have any other way to express their joy, I don't know!

					Nothing special is happening here. Today is Mr. van Daan's birthday. He
					received two packets of tobacco, one serving of coffee, which his wife had
					managed to save, lemon punch from Mr. Kugler, sardines from Miep, eau de
					cologne from us, lilacs, tulips and, last but not least, a cake with raspberry
					filling, slightly gluey because of the poor quality of the flour and the lack
					of butter, but deli- cious anyway.

					All that talk about Peter and me has died down a bit. He's coming to pick me up
					tonight. Pretty nice of him, don't you think, since he hates doing it! We're
					very good friends. We spend a lot of time together and talk about every
					imaginable subject. It's so nice not having to hold back when we come to a
					delicate topic, the way I would with other boys. For example, we were talking
					about blood and somehow the conversation turned to menstruation, etc. He thinks
					we women are quite tough to be able to withstand the loss of blood, and that I
					am too. I wonder why?

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 146 - SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					And yet everything is still so difficult. You do know what I mean, don't you? I
					long so much for him to kiss me, but that kiss is taking its own sweet time.
					Does he still think of me as a friend? Don't I mean anything more?
				-
			-
				Entry 146 - SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					You and I both know that I'm strong, that I can carry most burdens alone. I've
					never been used to sharing my worries with anyone, and I've never clung to a
					mother, but I'd love to lay my head on his shoulder and just sit there quietly.
				-
			-
				Entry 146 - SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I can't, I simply can't forget that dream of Peter's cheek, when everything was
					so good! Does he have the same longing? Is he just too shy to say he loves me?
					Why does he want me near him so much? Oh, why doesn't he say something?
				-
			-
				Entry 146 - SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					I've got to stop, I've got to be calm. I'll try to be strong again, and if I'm
					patient, the rest will follow. But — and this is the worst part — I seem to be
					chasing him. I'm always the one who has to go upstairs; he never comes to me.
					But that's because of the rooms, and he understands why I object. Oh, I'm sure
					he understands more than I think .

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 147 - MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Contrary to my usual practice, I'm going to write you a detailed description of
					the food situation, since it's become a matter of some difficulty and
					importance, not only here in the Annex, but in all of Holland, all of Europe
					and even beyond.
				-
			-
				Entry 147 - MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					In the twenty-one months we've lived here, we've been through a good many "food
					cycles" — you'll understand what that means in a moment. A "food cycle" is a
					period in which we have only one particular dish or type of vegetable to eat.
					For a long time we ate nothing but endive. Endive with sand, endive without
					sand, endive with mashed potatoes, endive -and- mashed potato casserole. Then
					it was spinach, followed by kohlrabi, salsify, cucumbers, tomatoes, sauerkraut,
					etc., etc.
				-
			-
				Entry 147 - MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					It's not much fun when you have to eat, say, sauer- kraut every day for lunch
					and dinner, but when you're hungry enough, you do a lot of things. Now,
					however, we're going through the most delightful period so far, because there
					are no vegetables at all.
				-
			-
				Entry 147 - MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Our weekly lunch menu consists of brown beans, split-pea soup, potatoes with
					dumplings, potato kugel and, by the grace of God, turnip greens or rotten
					carrots, and then it's back to brown beans. Because of the bread shortage, we
					eat potatoes at every meal, starting with breakfast, but then we fry them a
					little. To make soup we use brown beans, navy beans, potatoes, packages of
					vege- table soup, packages of chicken soup and packages of bean soup. There are
					brown beans in everything, including the bread. For dinner we always have
					potatoes with imitation gravy and — thank goodness we've still got it — beet
					salad. I must tell you about the dumplings. We make them with government-issue
					flour, water and yeast. They're so gluey and tough that it feels as if you had
					rocks in your stomach, but oh well!
				-
			-
				Entry 147 - MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The high point is our weekly slice of liverwurst, and the jam on our unbuttered
					bread. But we're still alive, and much of the time it still tastes good too!

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					For a long time now I didn't know why I was bothering to do any schoolwork. The
					end of the war still seemed so far away, so unreal, like a fairy tale. If the
					war isn't over by September, I won't go back to school, since I don't want to
					be two years behind.
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Peter filled my days, nothing but Peter, dreams and thoughts until Saturday
					night, when I felt so utterly miserable! oh, it was awful. I held back my tears
					when I was with Peter, laughed uproariously with the van Daans as we drank
					lemon punch and was cheerful and excited, but the minute I was alone I knew I
					was going to cry my eyes out. I slid to the floor in my nightgown and began by
					saying my prayers, very fervently. Then I drew my knees to my chest, lay my
					head on my arms and cried, all huddled up on the bare floor. A loud sob brought
					me back down to earth, and I choked back my tears, since I didn't want anyone
					next door to hear me. Then I tried to pull myself together, saying over and
					over, "I must, I must, I must. . . " Stiff from sitting in such an unusual
					position, I fell back against the side of the bed and kept up my struggle until
					just before ten-thirty, when I climbed back into bed. It was over!
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					And now it's really over. I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to
					keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because
					that's what I want! I know I can write. A few of my stories are good, my
					descriptions of the Secret Annex are humorous, much of my diary is vivid and
					alive, but. . . it remains to be seen whether I really have talent.
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"Eva's Dream" is my best fairy tale, and the odd thing is that I don't have the
					faintest idea where it came from. Parts of "Cady's Life" are also good, but as
					a whole it's nothing special. I'm my best and harshest critic. I know what's
					good and what isn't. Unless you write yourself, you can't know how wonderful it
					is! I always used to bemoan the fact that I couldn't draw, but now I'm
					overjoyed that at least I can write. And if I don't have the talent to write
					books or newspaper articles, I can always write for myself. But I want to
					achieve more than that. I can't imagine having to live like Mother, Mrs. van
					Daan and all the women who go about their work and are then forgotten. I need
					to have something besides a husband and children to devote myself to! I don't
					want to have lived in vain like most people. I want to be useful or bring
					enjoyment to all people, even those I've never met. I want to go on living even
					after my death! And that's why I'm so grateful to God for having given me this
					gift, which I can use to develop myself and to express all that's inside me!
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					When I write I can shake off all my cares. My sor- row disappears, my spirits
					are revived! But, and that's a big question, will I ever be able to write
					something great, will I ever become a journalist or a writer?
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I hope so, oh, I hope so very much, because writing allows me to record
					everything, all my thoughts, ideals and fantasies.
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I haven't worked on "Cady's Life" for ages. In my mind I've worked out exactly
					what happens next, but the story doesn't seem to be coming along very well. I
					might never finish it, and it'll wind up in the wastepaper basket or the stove.
					That's a horrible thought, but then I say to myself, "At the age of fourteen
					and with so little experience, you can't write about philosophy."
				-
			-
				Entry 148 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					So onward and upward, with renewed spirits. It'll all work out, because I'm
					determined to write!

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					You asked me what my hobbies and interests are and I'd like to answer, but I'd
					better warn you, I have lots of them, so don't be surprised.
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					First of all: writing, but I don't really think of that as a hobby.
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Number two: genealogical charts. I'm looking in every newspaper, book and
					document I can find for the family trees of the French, German, Spanish,
					English, Austrian, Russian, Norwegian and Dutch royal famthes. I've made great
					progress with many of them, because for ! a long time I've been taking notes
					while reading biogra- I, phies or history books. I even copy out many of the
					passages on history.
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					So my third hobby is history, and Father's already bought me numerous books. I
					can hardly wait for the day when I'll be able to go to the public library and
					ferret out Iii the information I need.
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Number four is Greek and Roman mythology. I have various books on this subject
					too. I can name the nine Muses and the seven loves of Zeus. I have the wives of
					Hercules, etc., etc., down pat.
				-
			-
				Entry 149 - THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					My other hobbies are movie stars and family photographs. I'm crazy about
					reading and books. I adore the history of the arts, especially when it concerns
					writers, poets and painters; musicians may come later. I loathe algebra,
					geometry and arithmetic. I enjoy all my other school subjects, but history's my
					favorite!

					My dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					My head's in a whirl, I really don't know where to begin. Thursday (the last
					time I wrote you) everything was as usual. Friday afternoon (Good Friday) we
					played Monopoly; Saturday afternoon too. The days passed very quickly. Around
					two o'clock on Saturday, heavy firing ii began-machine guns, according to the
					men. For the rest, everything was quiet.
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four- thirty, at my invitation. At
					five-fifteen we went to the Ii front attic, where we stayed until six. There
					was a beautil ful Mozart concert on the radio from six to seven-fifteen; I
					especially enjoyed the Kleine Nachtmusik. I can hardly bear to listen in the
					kitchen, since beautiful music stirs me to the very depths of my soul. Sunday
					evening Peter couldn't take his balli, because the washtub was down in the
					office kitchen, filled with laundry. The two of us went to the front attic
					together, and in order to be able to sit comfortably, I took along the only
					cushion I could find in my room. We seated ourselves on a packing crate. Since
					both the crate and the cushion were very narrow, we were sitting quite close,
					leaning against two other crates; Mouschi kept us company, so we weren't
					without a chaperon. Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. van Daan whistled and
					asked if we had Mr. Dussel's cushion. We jumped up and went downstairs willi
					the cushion, the cat and Mr. van Daan. This cushion was the source of much
					misery. Dussel was angry because I'd taken the one he uses as a pillow, and he
					was afraid it might be covered with fleas; he had the entire house in an uproar
					because of this one cushion. In revenge, Peter and I stuck two hard brushes in
					his bed, but had to take them out again when Dussel unexpectedly decided to go
					sit in his room. We had a really good laugh at this little intermezzo.
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					But our fun was short-lived. At nine— thirty Peter knocked gently on the door
					and asked Father to come upstairs and help him with a difficult English
					sentence.
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"That sounds fishy," I said to Margot. "It's obviously a pretext. You can tell
					by the way the men are talking that there's been a break-in!" I was right. The
					warehouse was being broken into at that very moment. Father, Mr. van Daan and
					Peter were downstairs in a flash. Margot, Mother, Mrs. van D. and I waited.
					Four frightened women need to talk, so that's what we did until we heard a bang
					downstairs. After that all was quiet. The clock struck quarter to ten. The
					color had drained from our faces, but we remained calm, even though we were
					afraid. Where were the men? What was that bang? Were they fighting with the
					burglars? We were too scared to think; all we could do was wait.
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Ten o'clock, footsteps on the stairs. Father, pale and nervous, came inside,
					followed by Mr. van Daan. "Lights out, tiptoe upstairs, we're expecting the
					police!" There wasn't time to be scared. The lights were switched off, I
					grabbed a jacket, and we sat down upstairs.
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					"What happened? Tell us quickly!"
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					There was no one to tell us; the men had gone back downstairs. The four of them
					didn't come back up until ten past ten. Two of them kept watch at Peter's open
					window. The door to the landing was locked, the book- case shut. We draped a
					sweater over our night-light, and then they told us what had happened:
				-
			-
				Entry 150 - TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Peter was on the landing when he heard two loud bangs. He went downstairs and
					saw that a large panel was missing from the left half of the warehouse door. He
					dashed upstairs, alerted the "Home Guard," and the four of them went
					downstairs. When they entered the warehouse, the burglars were going about
					their business. Without thinking, Mr. van Daan yelled "Police!" Hur- ried
					footsteps outside; the burglars had fled. The board was put back in the door so
					the police wouldn't notice the gap, but then a swift kick from outside sent it
					flying to the floor. The men were amazed at the burglars' audacity. Both Peter
					and Mr. van Daan felt a murderous rage come over them. Mr. van Daan slammed an
					ax against the floor, and all was quiet again. Once more the panel was re-
					placed, and once more the attempt was foiled. Outside, a man and a woman shone
					a glaring flashlight through the opening, lighting up the entire warehouse.
					"What the ..." mumbled one of the men, but now their roles had been reversed.
					Instead of policemen, they were now burglars. All four of them raced upstairs.
					Dussel and Mr. van Daan snatched up Dussel's books, Peter opened the doors and
					windows in the kitchen and private office, hurled the phone to the ground, and
					the four of them finally ended up behind the bookcase.

				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					In all probability the man and woman with the flashlight had alerted the
					police. It was Sunday night, Easter Sunday. The next day, Easter Monday, the
					office was going to be closed, which meant we wouldn't be able to move around
					until Tuesday morning.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Think of it, having to sit in such terror for a day and two nights! We thought
					of nothing, but simply sat there in pitch darkness — in her fear, Mrs. van D.
					had switched off the lamp. We whispered, and every time we heard a creak,
					someone said, "Shh, shh."
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					It was ten-thirty, then eleven. Not a sound. Father and Mr. van Daan took turns
					coming upstairs to us. Then, at eleven-fifteen, a noise below. Up above you
					could hear the whole family breathing. For the rest, no one moved a muscle.
					Footsteps in the house, the private office, the kitchen, then. . . on the
					staircase. All sounds of breathing stopped, eight hearts pounded. Foot- steps
					on the stairs, then a rattling at the bookcase. This moment is indescribable.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"Now we're done for," I said, and I had visions of all fifteen of us being
					dragged away by the Gestapo that very night.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					More rattling at the bookcase, twice. Then we heard a can fall, and the
					footsteps receded. We were out of danger, so far! A shiver went though
					everyone's body, I heard several sets of teeth chattering, no one said a word.
					We stayed like this until eleven— thirty.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					There were no more sounds in the house, but a light was shining on our landing,
					right in front of the bookcase. Was that because the police thought it looked
					so suspicious or because they simply forgot? Was anyone going to come back and
					turn it off? We found our tongues again.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					There were no longer any people inside the building, but perhaps someone was
					standing guard outside. We then did three things: tried to guess what was going
					on, trembled with fear and went to the bathroom. Since the buckets were in the
					attic, all we had was Peter's metal wastepaper basket. Mr. van Daan went first,
					then Father, but Mother was too embarrassed. Father brought the waste- basket
					to the next room, where Margot, Mrs. van Daan and I gratefully made use of it.
					Mother finally gave in. There was a great demand for paper, and luckily I had
					some in my pocket.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					The wastebasket stank, everything went on in a whisper, and we were exhausted.
					It was midnight.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"Lie down on the floor and go to sleep!" Margot and I were each given a pillow
					and a blanket. Margot lay down near the food cupboard, and I made my bed
					between the table legs. The smell wasn't quite so bad when you were lying on
					the floor, but Mrs. van Daan quietly went and got some powdered bleach and
					draped a dish towel over the potty as a further precaution.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Talk, whispers, fear, stench, farting and people continually going to the
					bathroom; try sleeping through that! By two-thirty, however, I was so tired I
					dozed off and didn't hear a thing until three — thirty. I woke up when Mrs. van
					D. lay her head on my feet.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					"For heaven's sake, give me something to put on!" I said. I was handed some
					clothes, but don't ask what: a pair of wool slacks over my pajamas, a red
					sweater and a black skirt, white understockings and tattered kneesocks.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. sat back down on the chair, and Mr. van D. lay down with his head
					on my feet. From three- thirty onward I was engrossed in thought, and still
					shiver- ing so much that Mr. van Daan couldn't sleep. I was preparing myself
					for the return of the police. We'd tell them we were in hiding; if they were
					good people, we'd be safe, and if they were Nazi sympathizers, we could try to
					bribe them!
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					"We should hide the radio!" moaned Mrs. van D.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					"Sure, in the stove," answered Mr. van D. "If they find us, they might as well
					find the radio!"
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					"Then they'll also find Anne's diary," added Father.
				-
			-

				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					This and the police rattling on the bookcase were the moments when I was most
					afraid. Oh, not my diary; if my diary goes, I go too! Thank goodness Father
					didn't say anything more.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					There's no point in recounting all the conversations; so much was said. I
					comforted Mrs. van Daan, who was very frightened. We talked about escaping,
					being interrogated by the Gestapo, phoning Mr. Kleiman and being courageous.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					"We must behave like soldiers, Mrs. van Daan. If our time has come, well then,
					it'll be for Queen and Country, for freedom, truth and justice, as they're
					always telling us on the radio. The only bad thing is that we'll drag the
					others down with us!"
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					After an hour Mr. van Daan switched places with his wife again, and Father came
					and sat beside me. The men smoked one cigarette after another, an occasional
					sigh was heard, somebody made another trip to the potty, and then everything
					began allover again.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Four o'clock, five, five-thirty. I went and sat with Peter by his window and
					listened, so close we could feel each other's bodies trembling; we spoke a word
					or two from time to time and listened intently. Next door they took down the
					blackout screen. They made a list of everything they were planning to tell Mr.
					Kleiman over the phone, because they intended to call him at seven and ask him
					to send someone over. They were taking a big chance, since the police guard at
					the door or in the warehouse might hear them calling, but there was an even
					greater risk that the police would return.

					I'm enclosing their list, but for the sake of clarity, I'll copy it here.

				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					Buralary: Police in building, up to bookcase, but no farther. Burglars
					apparently interrupted, forced warehouse door, fled through garden. Main
					entrance bolted; Kugler must have left through second door.
				-

					Typewriter and adding machine safe in black chest in private office.

					Only Bep or Kugler have key to second door; lock may be broken.

					Try to warn jan and get key, look around office; also feed cat.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 28
			-
				-
					For the rest, everything went according to plan. Mr. Kleiman was phoned, the
					poles were removed from the doors, the typewriter was put back in the chest.
					Then we all sat around the table again and waited for either jan or the police.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 29
			-
				-
					Peter had dropped off to sleep and Mr. van Daan ANNE FRANK and I were lying on
					the floor when we heard loud footsteps below. I got up quietly. "It's Jan!"
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 30
			-
				-
					"No, no, it's the police!" they all said.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 31
			-
				-
					There was a knocking at our bookcase. Miep whis- tied. This was too much for
					Mrs. van Daan, who sank limply in her chair, white as a sheet. If the tension
					had lasted another minute, she would have fainted.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 32
			-
				-
					Jan and Miep came in and were met with a delightful scene. The table alone
					would have been worth a photograph: a copy of Cinema Theater, opened to a page
					of dancing girls and smeared with jam and pectin, which we'd been taking to
					combat the diarrhea, two jam jars, half a bread roll, a quarter of a bread
					roll, pectin, a mirror, a comb, matches, ashes, cigarettes, tobacco, an
					ashtray, books, a pair of underpants, a flashlight, Mrs. van Daan's comb,
					toilet paper, etc.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 33
			-
				-
					Jan and Miep were of course greeted with shouts and tears. Jan nailed a
					pinewood board over the gap in the door and went off again with Miep to inform
					the police of the break-in. Miep had also found a note under the ware- house
					door from Sleegers, the night watchman, who had noticed the hole and alerted
					the police. Jan was also planning to see Sleegers.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 34
			-
				-
					So we had half an hour in which to put the house and ourselves to rights. I've
					never seen such a transformation as in those thirty minutes. Margot and I got
					the beds ready downstairs, went to the bathroom, brushed our teeth, washed our
					hands and combed our hair. Then I straightened up the room a bit and went back
					upstairs. The table had already been cleared, so we got some water, made coffee
					and tea, boiled the milk and set the table. Father and Peter emptied our
					improvised potties and rinsed them with warm water and powdered bleach. The
					largest one was filled to the brim and was so heavy they had a hard time
					lifting it. To make things worse, it was leaking, so they had to put it in a
					bucket.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 35
			-
				-
					At eleven o'clock Jan was back and joined us at the table, and gradually
					everyone began to relax. Jan had the following story to tell:
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 36
			-
				-
					Mr. Sleegers was asleep, but his wife told Jan that her husband had discovered
					the hole in the door while making his rounds. He called in a policeman, and the
					two of them searched the building. Mr. Sleegers, in his capacity as night
					watchman, patrols the area every night on his bike, accompanied by his two
					dogs. His wife said he would come on Tuesday and tell Mr. Kugler the rest. No
					one at the police station seemed to know anything about the break-in, but they
					made a note to come first thing Tuesday morning to have a look.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 37
			-
				-
					On the way back Jan happened to run into Mr. van Hoeven, the man who supplies
					us with potatoes, and told him of the break— in. "I know," Mr. van Hoeven
					calmly replied. "Last night when my wife and I were walking past your building,
					I saw a gap in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I peeked inside with a
					flashlight, and that's when the burglars must have run off. To be on the safe
					side, I didn't call the police. I thought it wouldn't be wise in your case. I
					don't know anything, but I have my suspicions." Jan thanked him and went on.
					Mr. van Hoeven obviously suspects we're here, because he always delivers the
					potatoes at lunchtime. A decent man!
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 38
			-
				-
					It was one o'clock by the time Jan left and we'd done the dishes. All eight of
					us went to bed. I woke up at quarter to three and saw that Mr. Dussel was
					already up. My face rumpled with sleep, I happened to run into Peter in the
					bathroom, just after he'd come downstairs. We agreed to meet in the office. I
					freshened up a bit and went down.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 39
			-
				-
					"After all this, do you still dare go to the front attic?" he asked. I nodded,
					grabbed my pillow, with a cloth wrapped around it, and we went up together. The
					weather was gorgeous, and even though the air-raid sirens soon began to wail,
					we stayed where we were. Peter put his arm around my shoulder, I put mine
					around his, and we sat quietly like this until four o'clock, when Margot came
					to get us for coffee.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 40
			-
				-
					We ate our bread, drank our lemonade and joked (we were finally able to again),
					and for the rest everything was back to normal. That evening I thanked Peter
					because he'd been the bravest of us all.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 41
			-
				-
					None of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night. God was truly
					watching over us. Just think-the police were right at the bookcase, the light
					was on, and still no one had discovered our hiding place! "Now we're done for!"
					I'd whispered at that moment, but once again we were spared. When the invasion
					comes and the bombs start falling, it'll be every man for himself, but this
					time we feared for those good, innocent Christians who are helping us.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 42
			-
				-
					"We've been saved, keep on saving us!" That's all we can say.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 43
			-
				-
					This incident has brought about a whole lot of changes. As of now, Dussel will
					be doing his work in the bathroom, and Peter will be patrolling the house
					between eight-thirty and nine-thirty. Peter isn't allowed to open his window
					anymore, since one of the Keg people noticed it was open. We can no longer
					flush the toilet after nine-thirty at night. Mr. Sleegers has been hired as
					night watchman, and tonight a carpenter from the underground is coming to make
					a barricade out of our white Frankfurt bedsteads. Debates are going on left and
					right in the Annex. Mr. Kugler has reproached us for our carelessness. Jan also
					said we should never go downstairs. What we have to do now is find out whether
					Sleegers can be trusted, whether the dogs will bark if they hear someone behind
					the door, how to make the barricade, all sorts of things.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 44
			-
				-
					We've been strongly reminded of the fact that we're Jews in chains, chained to
					one spot, without any rights, but with a thousand obligations. We must put our
					feelings aside; we must be brave and strong, bear discomfort with- out
					complaint, do whatever is in our power and trust in God. One day this terrible
					war will be over. The time will come when we'll be people again and not just
					Jews!
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 45
			-
				-
					Who has inflicted this on us? Who has set us apart from all the rest? Who has
					put us through such suffering? It's God who has made us the way we are, but
					it's also God who will lift us up again. In the eyes of the world, we're
					doomed, but if, after all this suffering, there are still Jews left, the Jewish
					people will be held up as an example. Who knows, maybe our religion will teach
					the world and all the people in it about goodness, and that's the reason, the
					only reason, we have to suffer. We can never be just Dutch, or just English, or
					whatever, we will always be Jews as well. And we'll have to keep on being Jews,
					but then, we'll want to be.
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 46
			-
				-
					Be brave! Let's remember our duty and perform it without complaint. There will
					be a way out. God has never deserted our people. Through the ages Jews have had
					to suffer, but through the ages they've gone on living, and the centuries of
					suffering have only made them stronger. The weak shall fall and the strong
					shall survive and not be defeated!

					That night I really thought I was going to die. I waited for the police and I
					was ready for death, like a soldier on a battlefield. I'd gladly have given my
					life for my country. But now, now that I've been spared, my first wish after
					the war is to become a Dutch citizen. I love the Dutch, I love this country, I
					love the language, and I want to work here. And even if I have to write to the
					Queen herself, I won't give up until I've reached my goal!
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 48
			-
				-
					I'm becoming more and more independent of my parents. Young as I am, I face
					life with more courage and have a better and truer sense of justice than
					Mother. I know what I want, I have a goal, I have opinions, a religion and
					love. If only I can be myself, I'll be satisfied. I know that I'm a woman, a
					woman with inner strength and a great deal of courage!
				-
			-
				Entry 151 - [DATE UNSPECIFIED - BEGINNING OF PART TWO]: Paragraph 49
			-
				-
					If God lets me live, I'll achieve more than Mother ever did, I'll make my voice

					Everyone here is still very tense. Pirn has nearly reached the bothng point;
					Mrs. van D. is lying in bed with a cold, grumbling; Mr. van D. is growing pale
					without his cigarettes; Dussel, who's having to give up many of his comforts,
					is carping at everyone; etc., etc. We seem to have run out of luck lately. The

					I'm occasionally sentimental, as you know, but from time to time I have reason

					"There's just one bad thing after another. When will it all end?" You can sure
					say that again. Guess what's happened now? Peter forgot to unbolt the front
					door. As a result, Mr. Kugler and the warehouse employees couldn't get in. He
					went to Keg's, smashed in our office kitchen window and got in that way. The
					windows in the Annex were open, and the Keg people saw that too. What must they
					be thinking? And van Maaren? Mr. Kugler's furious. We accuse him of not doing
					anything to reinforce the doors, and then we do a stupid thing like this!
					Peter's extremely upset. At the table, Mother said she felt more sorry for
					Peter than for anyone else, and he nearly began to cry. We're equally to blame,
					since we usually ask him every day if he's unbolted the door, and so does Mr.
					van Daan. Maybe I can go comfort him later on. I want to help him so much!

			-
				-
					A week ago Saturday, Boche suddenly got sick. He sat quite still and started
					drooling. Miep immediately picked him up, rolled him in a towel, tucked him in
					her shopping bag and brought him to the dog-and-cat clinic. Boche had some kind
					of intestinal problem, so the vet gave him medicine. Peter gave it to him a few
					times, but Boche soon made himself scarce. I'll bet he was out courting his
					sweetheart. But now his nose is swollen and he meows whenever you pick him up
					-he was probably trying to steal food and somebody smacked him. Mouschi lost
					her voice for a few days. Just when we decided she had to be taken to the vet
					too, she started getting better.

					Remember yesterday's date, since it was a red-letter day for me. Isn't it an

					Last night at eight I was sitting with Peter on his divan and it wasn't long
					before he put an arm around me. (Since it was Saturday, he wasn't wearing his
					overalls.) "Why don t we move over a little," I said, "so won t keep bumping my
					head against the cupboard."
				-
			-
				Entry 154 - SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					He moved so far over he was practically in the corner. I slipped my arm under
					his and across his back, and he put his arm around my shoulder, so that I was
					nearly engulfed by him. We've sat like this on other occasions, but never so
					close as we were last night. He held me firmly against him, my left side
					against his chest; my heart had already begun to beat faster, but there was
					more to come. He wasn't satisfied until my head lay on his shoulder, with his
					on top of mine. I sat up again after about five minutes, but before long he
					took my head in his hands and put it back next to his. Oh, it was so wonderful.
					I could hardly talk, my pleasure was too intense; he caressed my cheek and arm,
					a bit clumsily, and played with my hair. Most of the time our heads were
					touching.
				-
			-
				Entry 154 - SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1944: Paragraph 5

					At nine-thirty we stood up. Peter put on his tennis shoes so he wouldn't make
					much noise on his nightly round of the building, and I was standing next to
					him. How I suddenly made the right movement, I don't know, but before we went
					downstairs, he gave me a. kiss, through my hair, half on my left cheek and half
					on my ear. I tore downstairs without looking back, and I long so much for
					today.

					Dearest Kitty,

			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Do you think Father and Mother would approve of a girl my age sitting on a
					divan and kissing a seventeen- and- a-half-year-old boy? I doubt they would,
					but I have to trust my own judgment in this matter. It's so peaceful and safe,
					lying in his arms and dreaming, it's so thrilling to feel his cheek against
					mine, it's so wonderful to know there's someone waiting for me. But, and there
					is a but, will Peter want to leave it at that? I haven't forgotten his promise,
					but. . . he is a boy!
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I know I'm starting at a very young age. Not even fifteen and already so
					independent
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					— that's a little hard for other people to understand. I'm pretty sure Margot
					would never kiss a boy unless there was some talk of an engagement or marriage.
					Neither Peter nor I has any such plans. I'm also sure that Mother never touched
					a man before she met Father. What would my girlfriends or Jacque say if they
					knew I'd lain in Peter's arms with my heart against his chest, my head on his
					shoulder and his head and face against mine!
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Oh, Anne, how terribly shocking! But seriously, I don't think it's at all

					especially lately. Why
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-

			-

				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I've decided to look out for my own interests. He'd never want to hurt me or

					happy?
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Yet I have a feeling, Kitty, that you can sense my doubt. It must be my honesty
					rising in revolt against all this sneaking around. Do you think it's my duty to
					tell Father what I'm up to? Do you think our secret should be shared with a
					third person? Much of the beauty would be lost, but would it make me feel
					better inside? I'll bring it up with him.
				-
			-
				Entry 155 - MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Oh, yes, I still have so much I want to discuss with him, since I don't see the
					point of just cuddling. Sharing our thoughts with each other requires a great
					deal of trust, but we'll both be stronger because of it!

					P.S. We were up at six yesterday morning, because the whole family heard the

					victim this time. When we checked at seven o'clock, our doors were still shut
					tight, thank goodness!

					Everything's fine here. Last night the carpenter came again to put some sheets
					of iron over the door panels. Father just got through saying he definitely
					expects large-scale operations in Russia and Italy, as well as in the West,
					before May 20; the longer the war lasts, the harder it is to imagine being

					Yesterday Peter and I finally got around to having the talk we've been
					postponing for the last ten days. I told him all about girls, without
					hesitating to discuss the most intimate matters. I found it rather amusing that
					he thought the opening in a woman's body was simply left out of illustrations.
					He couldn't imagine that it was actually located between a woman's legs. The
					evening ended with a mutual kiss, near the mouth. It's really a lovely feeling!

					I might take my "favorite quotes notebook" up with me sometime so Peter and I

					Yesterday, as you've probably already discovered, was our Fiihrer's fifty-fifth

				Entry 159 - TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					For the last ten days Dussel hasn't been on speaking terms with Mr. van Daan,
					and all because of the new security measures since the break-in. One of these
					was that he's no longer allowed to go downstairs in the evenings. Peter and Mr.
					van Daan make the last round every night at nine-thirty, and after that no one
					may go downstairs. We can't flush the toilet anymore after eight at night or
					after eight in the morning. The windows may be opened only in the morning when
					the lights go on in Mr. Kugler's office, and they can no longer be propped open
					with a stick at night. This last measure is the reason for Dussel's sulking. He
					claims that Mr. van Daan bawled him out, but he has only himself to blame. He
					says he'd rather live without food than without air, and that they simply must
					figure out a way to keep the windows open.

					I replied that we never discussed matters of this sort with Mr. Kugler, only

				-
					He's also not allowed to sit in Mr. Kugler's office anymore on Saturday
					afternoons or Sundays, because the manager of Keg's might hear him if he
					happens to be next door. Dussel promptly went and sat there anyway. Mr. van
					Daan was furious, and Father went downstairs to talk to Dussel, who came up
					with some flimsy excuse, but even Father didn't fall for it this time. Now
					Father's keep- ing his dealings with Dussel to a minimum because Dussel
					insulted him. Not one of us knows what he said, but it must have been pretty
					awful.

					Mrs. van D. was in a bad mood this morning. All she did was complain, first

					We couldn't help but laugh at her, and it couldn't have been that bad, since

					the Great, Charles XII, Augustus the Strong, Stanislaus Leczinsky, Mazeppa, von
					Gorz, Bran- denburg, Western Pomerania, Eastern Pomerania and Denmark, plus the
					usual dates. Next, I wound up in Brazil, where I read about Bahia tobacco, the
					abundance of coffee, the one and a half million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro,
					Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and, last but not least, the Amazon River. Then about
					Negroes, mulattoes, mestizos, whites, the illiteracy rate — over 50 percent —
					and malaria. Since I had some time left, I glanced through a genealogical
					chart: John the Old, William Louis, Ernest

			-
				-
					I've never forgotten my dream of Peter Schiff (see the beginning of January).
					Even now I can still feel his cheek against mine, and that wonderful glow that
					made up for all the rest. Once in a while I'd had the same feeling with this
					Peter, but never so intensely. . . until last night. We were sitting on the
					divan, as usual, in each other's arms. Suddenly the everyday Anne slipped away
					and the second Anne took her place. The second Anne, who's never overconfident
					or amusing, but wants only to love and be gentle.
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I sat pressed against him and felt a wave of emotion come over me. Tears rushed
					to my eyes: those from the left fell on his overalls, while those from the
					right trickled down my nose and into the air and landed beside the first. Did
					he notice? He made no movement to show that he had. Did he feel the same way I
					did? He hardly said a word. Did he realize he had two Annes at his side? My
					questions went unanswered.
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					At eight -thirty I stood up and went to the window, where we always say
					good-bye. I was still trembling, I was still Anne number two. He came over to
					me, and I threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on his left cheek. I was
					about to kiss the other cheek when my mouth met his, and we pressed our lips
					together. In a daze, we embraced, over and over again, never to stop, oh!
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Peter needs tenderness. For the first time in his life he's discovered a girl;
					for the first time he's seen that even the biggest pests also have an inner
					self and a heart, and are transformed as soon as they're alone with you. For
					the first time in his life he's given himself and his friendship to another
					person. He's never had a friend before, boy or girl. Now we've found each
					other. I, for that matter, didn't know him either, had never had someone I
					could confide in, and it's led to this . . .
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					The same question keeps nagging me: "Is it right?" Is it right for me to yield
					so soon, for me to be so passionate, to be filled with as much passion and
					desire as Peter? Can I, a girl, allow myself to go that far?
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 7

				-
					There's only one possible answer: "I'm longing so much. . . and have for such a

				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					In the mornings we act normally, in the afternoons too, except now and then.
					But in the evenings the suppressed longing of the entire day, the happiness and
					the bliss of all the times before come rushing to the surface, and all we can
					think about is each other. Every night, after our last kiss, I feel like
					running away and never looking him
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-

					in the eyes again. Away, far away into the darkness and alone!
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 10

					And what awaits me at the bottom of those fourteen stairs? Bright lights,
					questions and laughter. I have to act normally and hope they don't notice
					anything.
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					My heart is still too tender to be able to recover so quickly from a shock like
					the one I had last night. The gentle Anne makes infrequent appearances, and
					she's not about to let herself be shoved out the door so soon after she's
					arrived. Peter's reached a part of me that no one has ever reached before,
					except in my dream! He's taken hold of me and turned me inside out. Doesn't
					everyone need a little quiet time to put themselves to rights again? Oh, Peter,
					what have you done to me? What do you want from me?
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Where will this lead? Oh, now I understand Bep. Now, now that I'm going through
					it myself, I understand her doubts! if I were older and he wanted to marry me,
					what would my answer be? Anne, be honest! You wouldn't be able to marry him.
					But it's so hard to let go. Peter still has too little character, too little
					willpower, too little courage and strength. He's still a child, emotionally no
					older than I am: all he wants is happiness and peace of mind. Am I really only
					fourteen? Am I really just a silly schoolgirl? Am I really so inexperienced in
					everything? I have more experience than most: I've experienced something almost
					no one my age ever has.
				-
			-
				Entry 161 - FRIDAY, APRIF 28, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					I'm afraid of myself, afraid my longing is making me yield too soon. How can it
					ever go right with other boys later on? Oh, it's so hard, the eternal struggle
					between heart and mind. There's a time and a place for both, but how can I be
					sure that I've chosen the right time?

				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Saturday night I asked Peter whether he thinks I should tell Father about us.
					After we'd discussed it, he said he thought I should. I was glad; it shows he's
					sensible, and sensitive. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with Father to
					get some water. While we were on the stairs, I said, "Father, I'm sure you've
					gathered that when Peter and I are together, we don't exactly sit at opposite
					ends of the room. Do you think that's wrong?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Father paused before answering: "No, I don't think it's wrong. But Anne, when
					you're living so close together, as we do, you have to be careful." He said
					some other words to that effect, and then we went upstairs.
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Sunday morning he called me to him and said, "Anne, I've been thinking about
					what you said." (Oh, oh, I knew what was coming!) "Here in the Annex it's not
					such a good idea. I thought you were just friends. Is Peter in love with you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					"Of course not," I answered.
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					"Well, you know I understand both of you. But you must be the one to show
					restraint; don't go upstairs so often, don't encourage him more than you can
					help. In matters like these, it's always the man who takes the active role, and
					it's up to the woman to set the limits. Outside, where you're free, things are
					quite different. You see other boys and girls, you can go outdoors, take part
					in sports and all kinds of activities. But here, if you're together too much
					and want to get away, you can't. You see each other every hour of the day-all
					the time, in fact. Be careful, Anne, and don't take it too seriously!
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 7

				-
					"I don't, Father, but Peter's a decent boy, a nice boy."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					"Yes, but he doesn't have much strength of character. He can easily be
					influenced to do good, but also to do bad. I hope for his sake that he stays
					good, because he's basically a good person."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 9

					We talked some more and agreed that Father would speak to him too.
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Sunday afternoon when we were in the front attic, Peter asked, "Have you talked
					to your Father yet, Anne?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					"Yes," I replied, "I'll tell you all about it. He doesn't think it's wrong, but
					he says that here, where we're in such close quarters, it could lead to
					conflicts."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					"We've already agreed not to quarrel, and I plan to keep my promise."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					"Me too, Peter. But Father didn't think we were serious, he thought we were
					just friends. Do you think we still can be?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					"Yes, I do. How about you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					"Me too. I also told Father that I trust you. I do trust you, Peter, just as
					much as I do Father. And I think you're worthy of my trust. You are, aren't
					you?"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					"I hope so." (He was very shy, and blushing.)
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					"I believe in you, Peter," I continued. "I believe you have a good character
					and that you'll get ahead in this world."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					After that we talked about other things. Later I said, "If we ever get out of
					here, I know you won't give me another thought."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					He got all fired up. "That's not true, Anne. Oh no, I won't let you even think
					that about me!"
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					Just then somebody called us.
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Father did talk to him, he told me Monday. "Your Father thought our friendship
					might turn into love," he said. "But I told him we'd keep ourselves under
					control."
				-
			-
				Entry 162 - TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1944: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					Father wants me to stop going upstairs so often, but I don't want to. Not just
					because I like being with Peter, but because I've said I trust him. I do trust
					him, and I want to prove it to him, but I'll never be able to if I stay
					downstairs out of distrust.

					him a jar of lemon syrup (to make lemonade), Miep a book, Little Martin, and
					Bep a plant. He treated everyone to an egg.

					First the weekly news! We're having a vacation from politics. There's nothing,
					and I mean absolutely nothing, to report. I'm also gradually starting to
					believe that the invasion will come. After all, they can't let the Russians do
					all the dirty work; actually, the Russians aren't doing anything at the moment
					either.

					Mr. Kleiman comes to the office every morning now. He got a new set of springs

					surprisingly, he isn't at all in the mood. Mr. Kleiman also brought some flea

					Have I told you that our Boche has disappeared? We haven't seen hide nor hair

					animal lover has turned her into a tasty dish. Perhaps some girl who can afford
					it will be wearing a cap made of Boche's fur. Peter is heartbroken.

					For the last two weeks we've been eating lunch at eleven-thirty on Saturdays;
					in the mornings we have to make do with a cup of hot cereal. Starting tomorrow
					it'll be like this every day; that saves us a meal. Vegetables are still very
					hard to come by. This afternoon we had rotten boiled lettuce. Ordinary lettuce,
					spinach and boiled let- tuce, that's all there is. Add to that rotten potatoes,

					As you can no doubt imagine, we often say in despair, "What's the point of the

					destruction?"
				-
			-
				Entry 163 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					The question is understandable, but up to now no one has come up with a
					satisfactory answer. Why is England manufacturing bigger and better airplanes
					and bombs and at the same time churning out new houses for reconstruction? Why
					are millions spent on the war each day, while not a penny is available for
					medical science, artists or the poor? Why do people have to starve when
					mountains of food are rotting away in other parts of the world? Oh, why are
					people so crazy?
				-
			-
				Entry 163 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I don't believe the war is simply the work of politicians and capitalists. Oh
					no, the common man is every bit as guilty; otherwise, people and nations would
					have re- belled long ago! There's a destructive urge in people, the urge to
					rage, murder and kill. And until all of humanity, without exception, undergoes
					a metamorphosis, wars will continue to be waged, and everything that has been
					carefully built up, cultivated and grown will be cut down and destroyed, only
					to start allover again!
				-
			-
				Entry 163 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I've often been down in the dumps, but never desperate. I look upon our life in
					hiding as an interesting adventure, full of danger and romance, and every
					privation as an amusing addition to my diary. I've made up my mind to lead a
					different life from other girls, and not to become an ordinary housewife later
					on. What I'm experiencing here is a good beginning to an interesting life, and
					that's the reason — the only reason — why I have to laugh at the humorous side
					of the most dangerous moments.
				-
			-
				Entry 163 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I'm young and have many hidden qualities; I'm young and strong and living
					through a big adventure; I'm right in the middle of it and can't spend all day
					complaining because it's impossible to have any fun! I'm blessed with many
					things: happiness, a cheerful disposition and strength. Every day I feel myself
					maturing, I feel liberation drawing near, I feel the beauty of nature and the
					goodness of the people around me. Every day I think what a fascinating and
					amusing adventure this is! With all that, why should I despair?

					Dear Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Father's unhappy with me. After our talk on Sunday he thought I'd stop going
					upstairs every evening. He won't have any of that "Knutscherej"* [* Necking]
					going on. I can't stand that word. Talking about it was bad enough — why does
					he have to make me feel bad too! I'll have a word with him today. Margot gave
					me some good advice.
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Here's more or less what I'd like to say:
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I think you expect an explanation from me, Father, so I'll give you one. You're
					disap- pointed in me, you expected more restraint from me, you no doubt want me
					to act the way a fourteen-year-old is supposed to. But that's where you're
					wrong!
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Since we've been here, from July 1942 until a few weeks ago, I haven't had an
					easy time. If only you knew how much I used to cry at night, how unhappy and
					despondent I was, how lonely I felt, you'd understand my wanting to go
					upstairs! I've now reached the point where I don't need the support of Mother
					or anyone else. It didn't happen overnight. I've struggled long and hard and
					shed many tears to become as independent as I am now. You can laugh and refuse
					to believe me, but I don't care. I know I'm an independent person, and I don't
					feel I need to account to you for my actions. I'm only telling you this because
					I don't want you to think I'm doing things behind your back. But there's only
					one person I'm accountable to, and that's me.
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					When I was having problems, everyone — and that includes you — closed their
					eyes and ears and didn't help me. On the contrary, all I ever got were
					admonitions not to be so noisy. I was noisy only to keep myself from being
					miserable all the time. I was overconfident to keep from having to listen to
					the voice inside me. I've been putting on an act for the last year and a half,
					day in, day out. I've never complained or dropped my mask, nothing of the kind,
					and now. . . now the battle is over. I've won! I'm independent, in both body
					and mind. I don't need a mother anymore, and I've emerged from the struggle a
					stronger person.
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Now that it's over, now that I know the battle has been won, I want to go my
					own way, to follow the path that seems right to me. Don't think of me as a
					fourteen-year-old, since all these troubles have made me older; I won't regret
					my actions, I'll behave the way I think I should!
				-
			-
				Entry 164 - FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Gentle persuasion won't keep me from going upstairs. You'll either have to
					forbid it, or trust me through thick and thin. Whatever you do, just leave me
					alone!

			-
				-
					Last night before dinner I tucked the letter I'd written into Father's pocket.
					According to Margot, he read it and was upset for the rest of the evening. (I
					was upstairs doing the dishes!) Poor Pirn, I might have known what the effect
					of such an epistle would be. He's so sensitive! I immediately told Peter not to
					ask any questions or say anything more. Pirn's said nothing else to me about
					the matter. Is he going to?
				-
			-
				Entry 165 - SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Everything here is more or less back to normal. We can hardly believe what Jan,
					Mr. Kugler and Mr. Kleiman tell us about the prices and the people on the
					outside; half a pound of tea costs 350.00 guilders, half a pound of coffee
					80.00 guilders, a pound of butter 35.00 guilders, one egg 1.45 guilders. People
					are paying 14.00 guilders an ounce for Bulgarian tobacco! Everyone's trading on
					the black market; every errand boy has something to offer. The delivery boy
					from the bakery has supplied us with darning thread-90 cents for one measly
					skein-the milkman can get hold of ration books, an undertaker delivers cheese.
					Break-ins, murders and thefts are daily occurrences. Even the police and night
					watchmen are getting in on the act. Everyone wants to put food in their
					stomachs, and since salaries have been frozen, people have had to resort to
					swindling. The police have their hands full trying to track down the many girls
					of fifteen, sixteen, seventeen and older who are reported missing every day.

					See you later! (Actually, that's not the right phrase. In the German program

					should say, "Until we write again.")

					Father and I had a long talk yesterday afternoon. I cried my eyes out, and he
					cried too. Do you know what he said to me, Kitty?
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					"I've received many letters in my lifetime, but none as hurtful as this. You,
					who have had so much love from your parents. You, whose parents have always
					been ready to help you, who have always defended you, no matter what. You talk
					of not having to account to us for your actions! You feel you've been wronged
					and left to your own devices. No, Anne, you've done us a great injustice!
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					"Perhaps you didn't mean it that way, but that's what you wrote. No, Anne, we
					have done nothing to deserve such a reproach!"
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Oh, I've failed miserably. This is the worst thing I've ever done in my entire
					life. I used my tears to show off, to make myself seem important so he'd
					respect me. I've certainly had my share of unhappiness, and everything I said
					about Mother is true. But to accuse Pirn, who's so good and who's done
					everything for me-no, that was too cruel for words.
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					It's good that somebody has finally cut me down to size, has broken my pride,
					because I've been far too smug. Not everything Mistress Anne does is good! Any-
					one who deliberately causes such pain to someone they say they love is
					despicable, the lowest of the low!
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					What I'm most ashamed of is the way Father has forgiven me; he said he's going
					to throw the letter in the stove, and he's being so nice to me now, as if he
					were the one who'd done something wrong. Well, Anne, you still have a lot to
					learn. It's time you made a beginning, in- stead of looking down at others and
					always giving them the blame!
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I've known a lot of sorrow, but who hasn't at my age? I've been putting on an
					act, but was hardly even aware of it. I've felt lonely, but never desperate!
					Not like Father, who once ran out into the street with a knife so he could put
					an end to it all. I've never gone that far.
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					I should be deeply ashamed of myself, and I am. What's done can't be undone,
					but at least you can keep it from happening again. I'd like to start all over,
					and that shouldn't be difficult, now that I have Peter. With him supporting me,
					I know I can do it! I'm not alone anymore. He loves me, I love him, I have my
					books, my writing and my diary. I'm not all that ugly, or that stupid, I have a
					sunny disposition, and I want to develop a good character!
				-
			-
				Entry 166 - SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 7,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Yes, Anne, you knew full well that your letter was unkind and untrue, but you
					were actually proud of it! I'll take Father as my example once again, and I
					will improve myself.

			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Have I ever told you anything about our family? I don't think I have, so let me
					begin. Father was born in Frankfurt am Main to very wealthy parents: Michael
					Frank owned a bank and became a millionaire, and Alice Stern's parents were
					prominent and well-to-do. Michael Frank didn't start out rich; he was a
					self-made man. In his youth Father led the life of a rich man's son. Parties
					every week, balls, banquets, beautiful girls, waltzing, dinners, a huge house,
					etc. After Grandpa died, most of the money was lost, and after the Great War
					and inflation there was nothing left at all. Up until the war there were still
					quite a few rich relatives. So Father was extremely well-bred, and he had to
					laugh yesterday because for the first time in his fifty-five years, he scraped
					out the frying pan at the table.
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Mother's family wasn't as wealthy, but still fairly well-off, and we've
					listened openmouthed to stories of private balls, dinners and engagement
					parties with 250 guests.
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					We're far from rich now, but I've pinned all my hopes on after the war. I can
					assure you, I'm not so set on a bourgeois life as Mother and Margot. I'd like
					to spend a year in Paris and London learning the languages and studying art
					history. Compare that with Margot, who wants to nurse newborns in Palestine. I
					still have visions of gorgeous dresses and fascinating people. As I've told you
					many times before, I want to see the world and do all kinds of exciting things,
					and a little money won't hurt!
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					This morning Miep told us about her cousin's engagement party, which she went
					to on Saturday. The cousin's parents are rich, and the groom's are even richer.
					Miep made our mouths water telling us about the food that was served: vegetable
					soup with meatballs, cheese, rolls with sliced meat, hors d'oeuvres made with
					eggs and roast beef, rolls with cheese, genoise, wine and cigarettes, and you
					could eat as much as you wanted.
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Miep drank ten schnapps and smoked three cigarettes — could this be our
					temperance advocate? If Miep drank all those, I wonder how many her spouse
					managed to toss down? Everyone at the party was a little tipsy, of course.
					There were also two officers from the Homicide Squad, who took photographs of
					the wedding couple. You can see we're never far from Miep's thoughts, since she
					promptly noted their names and addresses in case anything should happen and we
					needed contacts with good Dutch people.
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Our mouths were watering so much. We, who'd had nothing but two spoonfuls of
					hot cereal for breakfast and were absolutely famished; we, who get nothing but
					half-cooked spinach (for the vitamins!) and rotten pota- toes day after day;
					we, who fill our empty stomachs with nothing but boiled lettuce, raw lettuce,
					spinach, spinach and more spinach. Maybe we'll end up being as strong as
					Popeye, though up to now I've seen no sign of it!
				-
			-
				Entry 167 - MONDAY, MAY 8, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					If Miep had taken us along to the party, there wouldn't have been any rolls
					left over for the other guests. If we'd been there, we'd have snatched up
					everything in sight, including the furniture. I tell you, we were practically
					pulling the words right out of her mouth. We were gathered around her as if
					we'd never in all our lives heard of" delicious food or elegant people! And
					these are the granddaughters of the distinguished millionaire. The world is a
					crazy place!

					able to move and all sorts of other inconveniences! We proposed a variety of

					We were sitting in the attic yesterday afternoon working on our French when

					disaster — and shoved Mouschi, who was squatting beside her soggy litter box,
					back to the right place. This was followed by shouts and squeals, and then
					Mouschi, who by that time had finished peeing, took off downstairs. In search
					of something similar to her box, Mouschi had found herself a pile of wood
					shavings, right over a crack in the floor. The puddle immediately trickled down
					to the attic and, as luck would have it, landed in and next to the potato
					barrel. The cethng was dripping, and since the attic floor has also got its
					share of cracks, little yellow drops were leaking through the ceiling and onto
					the dining table, between a pile of stockings and books.

				Entry 169 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I was doubled up with laughter, it was such a funny sight. There was Mouschi
					crouched under a chair, Peter armed with water, powdered bleach and a cloth,
					and Mr. van Daan trying to calm everyone down. The room was soon set to rights,
					but it's a well-known fact that cat puddles stink to high heaven. The potatoes
					proved that all too well, as did the wood shavings, which Father collected in a
					bucket and brought downstairs to burn.

			-
				-
					Peter's hair had to be cut, and as usual his mother was to be the hairdresser.
					At seven twenty-five Peter vanished into his room, and reappeared at the stroke
					of seven-thirty, stripped down to his blue swimming trunks and a pair of tennis
					shoes.

					Peter helped her look, rummaging around in her cosmetics drawer. "Don't make
					such a mess, Peter," she grumbled.
				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I didn't catch Peter's reply, but it must have been insolent, because she
					cuffed him on the arm. He cuffed her back, she punched him with all her might,
					and Peter pulled his arm away with a look of mock horror on his face. "Come on,
					old girl!"
				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. stayed put. Peter grabbed her by the wrists and pulled her all
					around the room. She laughed, cried, scolded and kicked, but nothing helped.
					Peter led his prisoner as far as the attic stairs, where he was obliged to let
					go of her. Mrs. van D. came back to the room and collapsed into a chair with a
					loud sigh.

				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I went to have a look and cooled her hot, red wrists with water. Peter, still
					by the stairs and growing impa- tient again, strode into the room with his belt
					in his hand, like a lion tamer. Mrs. van D. didn't move, but stayed by her
					writing desk, looking for a handkerchief. "You've got to apologize first."
				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 12

				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D. had to laugh in spite of herself. She got up and went toward the
					door, where she felt obliged to give us an explanation. (By us I mean Father,
					Mother and me; we were busy doing the dishes.) "He wasn't like this at home,"
					she said. "I'd have belted him so hard he'd have gone flying down the stairs
					[!]. He's never been so insolent. This isn't the first time he's deserved a
					good hiding. That's what you get with a modern upbringing, modern children. I'd
					never have grabbed my mother like that. Did you treat your mother that way, Mr.
					Frank?" She was very upset, pacing back and forth, saying whatever came into
					her head, and she still hadn't gone upstairs. Finally, at long last, she made
					her exit.
				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Dess than five minutes later she stormed back down the stairs, with her cheeks
					all puffed out, and flung her apron on a chair. When I asked if she was
					through, she replied that she was going downstairs. She tore down the stairs
					like a tornado, probably straight into the arms of her Putti.
				-
			-
				Entry 170 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					She didn't come up again until eight, this time with her husband. Peter was

					ill-mannered brat, no-good bum, bad example, Anne this, Margot that, I couldn't
					hear the rest.

				-
					Since I've left my entire "junk box" — including my fountain pen — upstairs and

				-
			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I'm terribly busy at the moment, and strange as it may sound, I don't have
					enough time to get through my pile of work. Shall I tell you briefly what I've
					got to do? Well then, before tomorrow I have to finish reading the first volume
					of a biography of Galileo Galilei, since it has to be returned to the library.
					I started reading it yesterday and have gotten up to page 220 out of 320 pages,
					so I'll manage it. Next week I have to read Palestine at the Cross- roads and
					the second volume of Galilei. Besides that, I finished the first volume of a
					biography of Emperor Charles V yesterday, and I still have to work out the many
					genealogical charts I've collected and the notes I've taken. Next I have three
					pages of foreign words from my various books, all of which have to be written
					down, memorized and read aloud. Number four: my movie stars are in a terrible
					disarray and are dying to be straightened out, but since it'll take several
					days to do that and Professor Anne is, as she's already said, up to her ears in
					work, they'll have to put up with the chaos a while longer. Then there're
					Theseus, Oedipus, Peleus, Orpheus, Jason and Hercules all waiting to be
					untangled, since their various deeds are running crisscross through my mind
					like mul— ticolored threads in a dress. Myron and Phidias are also urgently in
					need of attention, or else I'll forget entirely how they fit into the picture.
					The same applies, for example, to the Seven Years' War and the Nine Years' War.
					Now I'm getting everything all mixed up. Well, what can you do with a memory
					like mine! Just imagine how forgetful I'll be when I'm eighty!
				-
			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Oh, one more thing. The Bible. How long is it going to take before I come to
					the story of the bathing Susanna? And what do they mean by Sodom and Gomorrah?
					Oh, there's still so much to find out and learn. And in the meantime, I've left
					Charlotte of the Palatine in the lurch.
				-
			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 5

					You can see, can't you, Kitty, that I'm full to bursting?
				-
			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					And now something else. You've known for a long time that my greatest wish is
					to be a journalist, and later on, a famous writer. We'll have to wait and see
					if these grand illusions (or delusions!) will ever come true, but up to now
					I've had no lack of topics. In any case, after the war I'd like to publish a
					book called The Secret Annex. It remains to be seen whether I'll succeed, but
					my diary can serve as the basis.

			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 7

					I also need to finish "Cady's Life." I've thought up the rest of the plot.
					After being cured in the sanatorium, Cady goes back home and continues writing
					to Hans. It's 1941, and it doesn't take her long to discover Hans's Nazi
					sympathies, and since Cady is deeply concerned with the plight of the Jews and
					of her friend Marianne, they begin drifting apart. They meet and get back
					together, but break up when Hans takes up with another girl. Cady is shattered,
					and because she wants to have a good job, she studies nursing. After graduation
					she accepts a position, at the urging of her father's friends, as a nurse in a
					TB sanatorium in Switzerland. During her first vacation she goes to Lake Como,
					where she runs into Hans. He tells her that two years earlier he'd married
					Cady's successor, but that his wife took her life in a fit of depression. Now
					that he's seen his little Cady again, he realizes how much he loves her, and
					once more asks for her hand in marriage. Cady refuses, even though, in spite of
					herself, she loves him as much as ever. But her pride holds her back. Hans goes
					away, and years later Cady learns that he's wound up in England, where he's
					struggling with ill health.
				-
			-
				Entry 171 - THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					When she's twenty-seven, Cady marries a well-to-do man from the country, named
					Simon. She grows to love him, but not as much as Hans. She has two daughters
					and a son, Lthan, Judith and Nico. She and Simon are happy together, but Hans
					is always in the back of her mind until one night she dreams of him and says
					farewell.

				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D.: "The Germans have had plenty of time to fortify the Atlantic Wall,

					British. It's amazing how strong the Germans are!"
				-

				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 3

				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 6

					Mr. van D.: "I won't even answer that."
				-
			-

				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 9

					Mr. van D.: "No, I don't. I always keep my answers to the bare minimum.
				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D.: "But you always do have an answer and you always have to be right!
					Your predictions hardly ever come true, you know!"
				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 11

				-
					Mr. van D.: "So far they have."
				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Mrs. van D.: "No they haven't. You said the invasion was going to start last
					year, the Finns were supposed to have been out of the war by now, the Italian
					campaign ought to have been over by last winter, and the Russians should
					already have captured Lemberg. Oh no, I don't set much store by your
					predictions."
				-
			-
				Entry 173 - TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Mr. van D. (leaping to his feet): "Why don't you shut your trap for a change?
					I'll show you who's right; someday you'll get tired of needling me. I can't
					stand your bellyaching a minute longer, just wait, one day I'll make you eat
					your words!" (End of Act One.)

					Actually, I couldn't help giggling. Mother couldn't either, and even Peter was

					Last night when I came down from the attic, I noticed, the moment I entered the
					room, that the lovely vase of carnations had fallen over. Mother was down on
					her hands and knees mopping up the water and Margot was fishing my papers off
					the floor. "What happened?" I asked with anxious foreboding, and before they
					could reply, I assessed the damage from across the room. My entire genealogy
					file, my notebooks, my books, everything was afloat. I nearly cried, and I was
					so upset I started speaking
				-
			-
				Entry 175 - SATURDAY, MAY 20, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					German. I can't remember a word, but according to Margot I babbled something
					about "unlioersehbarer Schaden, schrecklich, entsetzlich, nie zu ersetzen"* [*
					Incalculable loss, terrible, awful, irreplaceable.] and much more. Fadier burst
					out laughing and Modier and Margot joined in, but I felt like crying because
					all my work and elaborate notes were lost.
				-
			-
				Entry 175 - SATURDAY, MAY 20, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I took a closer look and, luckily, die "incalculable loss" wasn't as bad as I'd
					expected. Up in die attic I carefully peeled apart die sheets of paper diat
					were stuck togedier and dien hung diem on die clodiesline to dry. It was such a
					funny sight, even I had to laugh. Maria de' Medici alongside Charles V, William

					Inside the front cover are the names of at least twenty girls who had it before
					I did. It's old, yellowed, full of scribbles, crossed-out words and revisions.

					Daan: the invasion still hasn't begun. I can safely say that all of Amsterdam,
					all of Holland, in fact the entire western coast of Europe, all the way down to
					Spain, are talking about the invasion day and night, debating, making bets and
					. . . hoping.

				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The suspense is rising to fever pitch; by no means has everyone we think of as
					"good" Dutch people kept their faith in the English, not everyone thinks the
					English bluff is a masterful strategical move. Oh no, people want deeds-great,
					heroic deeds.
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					No one can see farther than the end of their nose, no one gives a thought to
					the fact that the British are fighting for their own country and their own
					people; everyone thinks it's England's duty to save Holland, as quickly as
					possible. What obligations do the English have toward us? What have the Dutch
					done to deserve the generous help they so clearly expect? Oh no, the Dutch are
					very much mistaken. The English, despite their bluff, are certainly no more to
					blame for the war than all the other countries, large and small, that are now
					occupied by the Germans. The British are not about to offer their excuses;
					true, they were sleeping during the years Germany was rearming itself, but all
					the other countries, especially those bordering on Germany, were asleep too.
					England and the rest of the world have discovered that burying your head in the
					sand doesn't work, and now each of them, especially England, is having to pay a
					heavy price for its ostrich policy.
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					No country sacrifices its men without reason, and certainly not in the
					interests of another, and England is no exception. The invasion, liberation and
					freedom will come someday; yet England, not the occupied territories, will
					choose the moment.

			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					To our great sorrow and dismay, we've heard that many people have changed their
					attitude toward us Jews. We've been told that anti-Semitism has cropped up in
					circles where once it would have been unthinkable. This fact has affected us
					all very, very deeply. The reason for the hatred is understandable, maybe even
					human, but that doesn't make it right. According to the Christians, the Jews
					are blabbing their secrets to the Germans, denouncing their helpers and causing
					them to suffer the dreadful fate and punishments that have already been meted
					out to so many. All of this is true. But as with everything, they should look
					at the matter from both sides: would Christians act any differently if they
					were in our place? Could anyone, regardless of whether they're Jews or
					Christians, remain silent in the face of German pressure? Everyone knows it's
					practically impossible, so why do they ask the impossible of the Jews?
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					It's being said in underground circles that the German Jews who immigrated to
					Holland before the war and have now been sent to Poland shouldn't be allowed to
					return here. They were granted the right to asylum in Holland, but once Hitler
					is gone, they should go back to Germany.
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					When you hear that, you begin to wonder why we're fighting this long and
					difficult war. We're always being told that we're fighting for freedom, truth
					and justice! The war isn't even over, and already there's dissension and Jews
					are regarded as lesser beings. Oh, it's sad, very sad that the old adage has
					been confirmed for the umpteenth time: "What one Christian does is his own
					responsibthty, what one Jew does reflects on all Jews."
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					To be honest, I can't understand how the Dutch, a nation of good, honest,
					upright people, can sit in judgment on us the way they do. On us-the most
					oppressed, unfortunate and pitiable people in all the world.
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I have only one hope: that this anti-Semitism is just a passing thing, that the
					Dutch will show their true colors, that they'll never waver from what they know
					in their hearts to be just, for this is unjust!
				-
			-
				Entry 176 - MONDAY, MAY 22,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					And if they ever carry out this terrible threat, the meager handful of Jews
					still left in Holland will have to go. We too will have to shoulder our bundles
					and move on, away from this beautiful country, which once so kindly took us in
					and now turns its back on us.

					Dearest Kitty,

			-
				Entry 177 - THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Bep's engaged! The news isn't much of a surprise, though none of us are
					particularly pleased. Bertus may be a nice, steady, athletic young man, but Bep
					doesn't love him, and to me that's enough reason to advise her against marrying
					him.
				-
			-
				Entry 177 - THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Bep's trying to get ahead in the world, and Bertus is pulling her back: he's a
					laborer, without any interests or any desire to make something of himself, and
					I don't think that'll make Bep happy. I can understand Bep's wanting to put an
					end to her indecision; four weeks ago she decided to write him off, but then
					she felt even worse. So she wrote him a letter, and now she's engaged.
				-
			-
				Entry 177 - THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					There are several factors involved in this engagement. First, Bep's sick
					father, who likes Bertus very much. Second, she's the oldest of the Voskuijl
					girls and her mother teases her about being an old maid. Third, she's just
					turned twenty-four, and that matters a great deal to Bep.
				-
			-
				Entry 177 - THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Mother said it would have been better if Bep had simply had an affair with
					Bertus. I don't know, I feel sorry for Bep and can understand her loneliness.
					In any case, they can get married only after the war, since Bertus is in
					hiding, or at any rate has gone underground. Besides, they don't have a penny
					to their name and nothing in the way of a hope chest. What a sorry prospect for
					Bep, for whom we all wish the best. I only hope Bertus improves under her
					influence, or that Bep finds another man, one who knows how to appreciate her!

				-
			-
				Entry 178 - THE SAME DAY: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					He was hiding two Jews in his house. It's a heavy blow for us, not only because

					because it's terrible for Mr. van Hoeven.
				-
			-
				Entry 178 - THE SAME DAY: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The world's been turned upside down. The most decent people are being sent to
					concentration camps, prisons and lonely cells, while the lowest of the low rule
					over young and old, rich and poor. One gets caught for black marketeering,
					another for hiding Jews or other un- fortunate souls. Unless you're a Nazi, you
					don't know what's going to happen to you from one day to the next.
				-
			-
				Entry 178 - THE SAME DAY: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Mr. van Hoeven is a great loss to us too. Bep can't possibly lug such huge
					amounts of potatoes all the way here, nor should she have to, so our only
					choice is to eat fewer of them. I'll tell you what we have in mind, but it's
					certainly not going to make life here any more agreeable. Mother says we'll
					skip breakfast, eat hot cereal and bread for lunch and fried potatoes for
					dinner and, if possible, vegetables or lettuce once or twice a week. That's all
					there is. We're going to be hungry, but nothing's worse than being caught.

				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I feel more miserable than I have in months. Even after the break— in I didn't
					feel so utterly broken, inside and out. On the one hand, there's the news about
					Mr. van Hoeven, the Jewish question (which is discussed in detail by everyone
					in the house), the invasion (which is so long in coming), the awful food, the
					tension, the misera- ble atmosphere, my disappointment in Peter. On the other
					hand, there's Bep's engagement, the Pentecost reception, the flowers, Mr.
					Kugler's birthday, cakes and stories about cabarets, movies and concerts. That
					gap, that enormous gap, is always there. One day we're laugh- ing at the
					comical side of life in hiding, and the next day (and there are many such
					days), we're frightened, and the fear, tension and despair can be read on our
					faces.
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Miep and Mr. Kugler bear the greatest burden for us, and for all those in
					hiding-Miep in everything she does and Mr. Kugler through his enormous
					responsibthty for the eight of us, which is sometimes so overwhelming that he
					can hardly speak from the pent-up tension and strain. Mr. Kleiman and Bep also
					take very good care of us, but they're able to put the Annex out of their
					minds, even if it's only for a few hours or a few days. They have their own
					worries, Mr. Kleiman with his health and Bep with her engagement, which isn't
					looking very promising lat the moment. But they also have their outings, their
					visits with friends, their everyday lives as ordinary people, so that the
					tension is sometimes relieved, if only for a short while, while ours never is,
					never has been, not once in the two years we've been here. How much longer will
					this increasingly oppressive, unbearable weight press I down on us?
				-

					we can't flush the toilet, so we have to use a toilet brush; and we've been
					putting our dirty water into a big earthenware jar. We can man- age for today,
					but what will happen if the plumber can't fix it on his own? The Sanitation
					Department can't come until Tuesday.
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Miep sent us a raisin bread with "Happy Pentecost" written on top. It's almost
					as if she were mocking us, since our moods and cares are far from "happy."
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					We've all become more frightened since the van Hoeven business. Once again you
					hear "shh" from all I sides, and we're doing everything more quietly. The
					police forced the door there; they could just as easily do that here too! What
					will we do if we're ever. . . no, I mustn't write that down. But the question
					won't let itself be pushed to the back of my mind today; on the contrary, all
					the fear I've ever felt is looming before me in all its horror.
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					I had to go downstairs alone at eight this evening to use the bathroom. There
					was no one down there, since they were all listening to the radio. I wanted to
					be brave, but it was hard. I always feel safer upstairs than in that huge,
					silent house; when I'm alone with those mysterious muffied sounds from upstairs
					and the honking of horns in the street, I have to hurry and remind myself where
					I am to keep from getting the shivers.
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Miep has been acting much nicer toward us since her talk with Father. But I
					haven't told you about that yet. Miep came up one afternoon all flushed and
					asked Father straight out if we thought they too were infected with the current
					anti-Semitism. Father was stunned and quickly talked her out of the idea, but
					some of Miep's suspicion has lingered on. They're doing more errands for us now
					and showing more of an interest in our troubles, though we certainly shouldn't
					bother them with our woes. Oh, they're such good, noble people!
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I've asked myself again and again whether it wouldn't have been better if we
					hadn't gone into hiding, if we were dead now and didn't have to go through this
					misery, especially so that the others could be spared the burden. But we all
					shrink from this thought. We still love life, we haven't yet forgotten the
					voice of nature, and we keep hoping, hoping for. . . everything.
				-
			-
				Entry 179 - My dearest Kitty,: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					Let something happen soon, even an air raid. Nothing can be more crushing than
					this anxiety. Let the end come, however cruel; at least then we'll know whether
					we are to be the victors or the vanquished.

					Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday it was too hot to hold my fountain pen,
					which is why I couldn't write to you. Friday the drains were clogged, Saturday
					they were fixed. Mrs. Kleiman came for a visit in the afternoon and told us a
					lot about Jopiej she and Jacque van Maarsen are in the same hockey club. Sunday
					Bep dropped by to make sure there hadn't been a break-in and stayed for
					breakfast. Monday (a holiday because of Pentecost), Mr. Gies served as the
					Annex watchman, and Tuesday we were finally allowed to open the windows. We've
					seldom had a Pentecost weekend that was so beautiful and warm. Or maybe "hot"
					is a better word. Hot weather is horrible in the Annex. To give you an idea of
					the numerous complaints, I'll briefly describe these sweltering days.
				-
			-
				Entry 180 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1944: Paragraph 3

					Saturday: "Wonderful, what fantastic weather," we all said in the morning. "If

					to be shut.
				-
			-
				Entry 180 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Sunday: "The heat's unbearable, the butter's melt- ing, there's not a cool spot
					anywhere in the house, the bread's drying out, the milk's going sour, the
					windows can't be opened. We poor outcasts are suffocating while everyone else
					is enjoying their Pentecost." (According to Mrs. van D.)
				-

				Entry 180 - WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1944: Paragraph 5

				Entry 181 - FRIDAY, JUNE 2, 1944 J: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					"If you're going to the attic, take an umbrella with you, preferably a large
					one!" This is to protect you from "household showers." There's a Dutch proverb:
					"High and dry, safe and sound," but it obviously doesn't apply to wartime
					(guns!) and to people in hiding (cat box!). Mouschi's gotten into the habit of
					relieving herself on some newspapers or between the cracks in the floor boards,
					so we have good reason to fear the splatters and, even worse, the stench. The
					new Moortje in the warehouse has the same problem. Anyone who's ever had a cat
					that's not housebroken can imagine the smells, other than pepper and thyme,
					that permeate this house.
				-
			-
				Entry 181 - FRIDAY, JUNE 2, 1944 J: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					I also have a brand-new prescription for gunfire jitters: When the shooting
					gets loud, proceed to the nearest wooden staircase. Run up and down a few
					times, making sure to stumble at least once. What with the scratches and the
					noise of running and falling, you won't even be able to hear the shooting, much
					less worry about it. Yours truly has put this magic formula to use, with great
					success!

					A huge commotion in the Annex! Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited

					too good, too much of a fairy tale ever to come true? Will this year, 1944,
					bring us victory? We don't know yet. But where there's hope, there's life. It
					fills us with fresh courage and makes us strong again. We'll need to be brave
					to endure the many fears and hardships and the suffering yet to come. It's now
					a matter of remaining calm and steadfast, of gritting our teeth and keeping a

					ashore. Today there were 20,000 airplanes in action. The German coastal
					batteries were destroyed even before the landing; a small bridgehead has

					Great news of the invasion! The Allies have taken Bayeux, a village on the
					coast of France, and are now fighting for Caen. They're clearly intending to
					cut off the peninsula where Cherbourg is located. Every evening the war
					correspondents report on the difficulties, the courage and the fighting spirit
					of the army. To get their stories, they pull off the most amazing feats. A few
					of the wounded who are already back in England also spoke on the radio. Despite
					the miserable weather, the planes are flying dthgently back and forth. We heard
					over the BBC that Churchill wanted to land along with the troops on D Day, but
					Eisenhower and the other generals managed to talk him out of it. Just imagine,
					so much courage for such an old man he must be at least seventy!

					The excitement here has died down somewhat; still, we're all hoping that the
					war will finally be over by the end of the year. It's about time! Mrs. van
					Daan's constant griping is unbearable; now that she can no longer drive us
					crazy with the invasion, she moans and groans all day about the bad weather. If
					only we could plunk her down in the loft in a bucket of cold water!

					Everyone in the Annex except Mr. van Daan and Peter has read the Hunaarian
					Rhapsody trilogy, a biography of the composer, piano virtuoso and child prodigy
					Franz Liszt. It's very interesting, though in my opinion there's a bit too much
					emphasis on women; Liszt was not only the greatest and most famous pianist of
					his time, he was also the biggest womanizer, even at the age of seventy. He had
					an affair with Countess Marie d' Agoult, Princess Carolyne Sayn- Wittgenstein,
					the dancer Lola Montez, the pianist Agnes Kingworth, the pianist Sophie Menter,
					the Circassian princess Olga Janina, Baroness Olga Meyen- dorff, actress Lilia
					what's-her-name, etc., etc., and there's no end to it. Those parts of the book
					dealing with music and the other arts are much more interesting. Some of the
					people mentioned are Schumann, Clara Wieck, Hector Berlioz, Johannes Brahms,
					Beethoven, Joachim, Richard Wagner, Hans von Bulow, Anton Rubinstein, Frederic
					Chopin, Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Hiller, Hummel, Czerny, Rossini,
					Cherubini, Paganini, Mendels— sohn, etc., etc.
				-
			-
				Entry 184 - FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Liszt appears to have been a decent man, very generous and modest, though
					exceptionally vain. He helped others, put art above all else, was extremely
					fond of cognac and women, couldn't bear the sight of tears, was a gentleman,
					couldn't refuse anyone a favor, wasn't interested in money and cared about
					religious freedom and the world.

					Another birthday has gone by, so I'm now fifteen. I received quite a few gifts:
					Springer's five-volume art history book, a set of underwear, two belts, a
					handkerchief, two jars of yogurt, a jar of jam, two honey cookies (small), a
					botany book from Father and Mother, a gold bracelet from Margot, a sticker
					album from the van Daans, Biomalt and sweet peas from Dussel, candy from Miep,
					candy and notebooks from Bep, and the high point: the book Maria Theresa and
					three slices of full-cream cheese from Mr. Kugler. Peter gave me a lovely
					bouquet of peonies: the poor boy had put a lot of effort into finding a
					present, but nothing quite worked out.

					Yesterday Churchill, Smuts, Eisenhower and Arnold visited the French villages

				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					From our position here in Fort Annex, it's difficult to gauge the mood of the
					Dutch. No doubt many people are glad the idle (!) British have finally rolled
					up their sleeves and gotten down to work. Those who keep claim- ing they don't
					want to be occupied by the British don't realize how unfair they're being.
					Their line of reasoning boils down to this: England must fight, struggle and
					sacri- fice its sons to liberate Holland and the other occupied countries.
					After that the British shouldn't remain in Hoi— land: they should offer their
					most abject apologies to all the occupied countries, restore the Dutch East
					Indies to its rightful owner and then return, weakened and impoverished, to
					England. What a bunch of idiots. And yet, as I've already said, many Dutch
					people can be counted among their ranks. What would have become of Holland and
					its neighbors if England had signed a peace treaty with Germany, as it's had
					ample opportunity to do? Holland would have become German, and that would have
					been the end of that!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					All those Dutch people who still look down on the British, scoff at England and
					its government of old fogies, call the English cowards, yet hate the Germans,
					should be given a good shaking, the way you'd plump up a pillow. Maybe that
					would straighten out their jumbled brains!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Wishes, thoughts, accusations and reproaches are swirling around in my head.
					I'm not really as conceited as many people think; I know my various faults and
					shortcomings better than anyone else, but there's one difference: I also know
					that I want to change, will change and already have changed greatly!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Why is it, I often ask myself, that everyone still thinks I'm so pushy and such
					a know-it-all? Am I really so arrogant? Am I the one who's so arrogant, or are
					they? It sounds crazy, I know, but I'm not going to cross out that last
					sentence, because it's not as crazy as it seems. Mrs. van Daan and Dussel, my
					two chief accusers, are known to be totally unintelligent and, not to put too
					fine a point on it, just plain "stupid"! Stupid people usually can't bear it
					when others do something better than they do; the best examples of this are
					those two dummies, Mrs. van Daan and Dussel. Mrs. van D. thinks I'm stupid
					because I don't suffer so much from this ailment as she does, she thinks I'm
					pushy because she's even pushier, she thinks my dresses are too short because
					hers are even shorter, and she thinks I'm such a know-it-all because she talks
					twice as much as I do about topics she knows nothing about. The same goes for
					Dussel. But one of my favorite sayings is "Where there's smoke there's fire,"
					and I readily admit I'm a know-it-all.
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					What's so difficult about my personality is that I scold and curse myself much
					more than anyone else does; if Mother adds her advice, the pile of sermons
					becomes so thick that I despair of ever getting through them. Then I talk back
					and start contradicting everyone until the old famthar Anne refrain inevitably
					crops up again: "No one understands me!"
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					This phrase is part of me, and as unlikely as it may seem, there's a kernel of
					truth in it. Sometimes I'm so deeply buried under self-reproaches that I long
					for a word of comfort to help me dig myself out again. If only I had someone
					who took my feelings seriously. Alas, I haven't yet found that person, so the
					search must go on.
				-

				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					I know you're wondering about Peter, aren't you, Kit? It's true, Peter loves
					me, not as a girlfriend, but as a friend. His affection grows day by day, but
					some mysterious force is holding us back, and I don't know what it is.
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Sometimes I think my terrible longing for him was overexaggerated. But that's
					not true, because if I'm unable to go to his room for a day or two, I long for
					him as desperately as I ever did. Peter is kind and good, and yet I can't deny
					that he's disappointed me in many ways. I especially don't care for his dislike
					of religion, his table conversations and various things of that nature. Still,
					I'm firmly convinced that we'll stick to our agreement never to quarrel. Peter
					is peace-loving, tolerant and extremely easygoing. He lets me say a lot of
					things to him that he'd never accept from his mother. He's making a determined
					effort to remove the blots from his copybook and keep his affairs in order. Yet
					why does he hide his innermost self and never allow me access? Of course, he's
					much more closed than I am, but I know from experience (even though I'm
					constantly being accused of knowing all there is to know in theory, but not in
					practice) that in time, even the most uncommunicative types will long as much,
					or even more, for someone to confide in.

				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Is it because I haven't been outdoors for so long that I've become so smitten
					with nature? I remember a time when a magnificent blue sky, chirping birds,
					moonlight and budding blossoms wouldn't have captivated me. Things have changed
					since I came here. One night during the Pentecost holiday, for instance, when
					it was so hot, I struggled to keep my eyes open until eleven-thirty so I could
					get a good look at the moon, all on my own for once. Alas, my sacrifice was in
					vain, since there was too much glare and I couldn't risk opening a window. An-
					other time, several months ago, I happened to be upstairs one night when the
					window was open. I didn't go back down until it had to be closed again. The
					dark, rainy evening, the wind, the racing clouds, had me spellbound; it was the
					first time in a year and a half that I'd seen the night face-to-face. After
					that evening my longing to see it again was even greater than my fear of
					burglars, a dark rat-infested house or robberies. I went downstairs all by
					myself and looked out the windows in the kitchen and private office. Many
					people think nature is beautiful, many people sleep from time to time under the
					starry sky, and many people in hospitals and prisons long for the day when
					they'll be free to enjoy what nature has to offer. But few are as isolated and
					cut off as we are from die joys of nature, which can be shared by rich and poor
					alike.
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 15
			-
				-
					It's not just my imagination — looking at die sky, die clouds, die moon and die
					stars really does make me feel calm and hopeful. It's much better medicine than
					valerian or bromide. Nature makes me feel humble and ready to face every blow
					with courage!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					As luck would have it, I'm only able — except for a few rare occasions-to view
					nature through dusty curtains tacked over dirt-caked windows! it takes die
					pleasure out of looking. Nature is die one thing for which dlere is no
					substitute!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					One of die many questions that have often bodlered me is why women have been,
					and still are, thought to be so inferior to men. It's easy to say it's unfair,
					but that's not enough for me! I'd really like to know the reason for this great
					injustice!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Men presumably dominated women from the very beginning because of their greater
					physical strength; it's men who earn a living, beget children and do as they
					please. . . Until recently, women silently went along willi this, which was
					stupid, since the longer it's kept up, the more deeply entrenched it becomes.
					Fortunately, education, work and progress have opened women's eyes. In many
					countries they've been granted equal rights! many people, mainly women, but
					also men, now realize how wrong it was to tolerate this state of affairs for so
					long. Modern women want the right to be completely independent!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					But that's not all. Women should be respected as well! Generally speaking, men
					are held in great esteem in all parts ofthe world, so why shouldn't women have
					their share? Soldiers and war heroes are honored and commemorated, explorers
					are granted immortal fame, martyrs are revered, but how many people look upon
					women too as soldiers?
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					In the book Soldiers on the Home Front I was greatly struck by the fact that in
					childbirth alone, women commonly suffer more pain, illness and misery than any
					war hero ever does. And what's her reward for enduring all that pain? She gets
					pushed aside when she's disfigured by birth, her children soon leave, her
					beauty is gone. Women, who struggle and suffer pain to ensure the con-
					tinuation of the human race, make much tougher and more courageous soldiers
					than all those big-mouthed freedom- fighting heroes put together!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					I don't mean to imply that women should stop having children; on the contrary,
					nature intended them to, and that's the way it should be. What I condemn are
					our system of values and the men who don't acknowledge how great, difficult,
					but ultimately beautiful women's share in society is.
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					I agree completely with Paul de Kruif, the author of this book, when he says
					that men must learn that birth is no longer thought of as inevitable and
					unavoidable in those parts of the world we consider civthzed. It's easy for men
					to talk — they don't and never will have to bear the woes that women do!
				-
			-
				Entry 185 - TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1944: Paragraph 23
			-
				-
					I believe that in the course of the next century the notion that it's a woman's
					duty to have children will change and make way for the respect and admiration
					of all women, who bear their burdens without complaint or a lot of pompous
					words!

					New problems: Mrs. van D. is at her wit's end. She's talking about getting

					The mood has changed, everything's going enormously well. Cherbourg, Vitebsk
					and Zhlobin fell today. They're sure to have captured lots of men and
					equipment. Five German generals were killed near Cherbourg and two taken

					launched their wonder weapon, but a little firecracker like that won't hardly

					To be honest, I can't imagine how anyone could say "I'm weak" and then stay
					that way. If you know that about yourself, why not fight it, why not develop
					your character? Their answer has always been: "Because it's much easier not
					to!" This reply leaves me feeling rather discouraged. Easy? Does that mean a
					life of deceit and laziness is easy too? Oh no, that can't be true. It can't be
					true that people are so readily tempted by ease. . . and money. I've given a
					lot of thought to what my answer should be, to how I should get Peter to
					believe in himself and, most of all, to change himself for the better. I don't
					know whether I'm on the right track.

				Entry 190 - THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1944: Paragraph 6

					I've often imagined how nice it would be if someone were to confide everything

				-
					I've been drifting around at sea, have spent days searching for an effective

				Entry 190 - THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1944: Paragraph 9

					We're all alive, but we don't know why or what for; we're all searching for

					three have been raised in good famthes, we have the opportunity to get an
					education and make something of ourselves. We have many reasons to hope for
					great happiness, but. . . we have to earn it. And that's something you can't
					achieve by taking the easy way out. Earning happiness means doing good and
					working, not speculating and being lazy. Laziness may look inviting, but only
					work gives you true satisfaction.

				Entry 190 - THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					I can't understand people who don't like to work, but that isn't Peter's

					inferior to ever achieve anything. Poor boy, he's never known how it feels to
					make someone else happy, and I'm afraid I can't teach him. He isn't religious,
					scoffs at Jesus Christ and takes the Lord's name in vain, and though I'm not
					Orthodox either, it hurts me every time to see him so lonely, so scornful, so
					wretched.

					ability to believe in a higher order. You don't even have to live in fear of
					eternal punishment; the concepts of purgatory, heaven and hell are difficult
					for many people to accept, yet religion itself, any religion, keeps a person on
					the right path. Not the fear of God, but upholding your own sense of honor and
					obeying your own conscience. How noble and good everyone could be if, at the
					end of each day, they were to review their own behavior and weigh up the rights
					and wrongs. They would automatically try to do better at the start of each new
					day and, after a while, would certainly accomplish a great deal. Everyone is
					welcome to this prescription; it costs nothing and is definitely useful. Those
					who don't know will have to find out by experience that "a quiet conscience
					gives you strength!"

					Dearest Kitty,

				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Mr. Broks was in Beverwijk and managed to get hold of strawberries at the
					produce auction. They arrived here dusty and full of sand, but in large
					quantities. No less than twenty-four crates for the office and us. That very
					same evening we canned the first six jars and made eight jars of jam. The next
					morning Miep started making jam for the office.
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					At twelve-thirty the outside door was locked, crates were lugged into the
					kitchen, with Peter, Father and Mr. van Daan stumbling up the stairs. Anne got
					hot water from the water heater, Margot"", went for a bucket, all hands on
					deck! With a funny feeling in my stomach, I entered the overcrowded office
					kitchen. Miep, Bep, Mr. Kleiman, Jan, Father, Peter: the Annex contingent and
					the Supply Corps all mixed up together, and that in the middle of the day!
					Curtains and windows open, loud voices, banging doors — I was trembling with
					excitement. I kept thinking, "Are we really in hiding?" This must be how it
					feels when you can finally go out into the world again. The pan was full, so I
					dashed upstairs, where the rest of the family was hulling strawberries around
					the kitchen table. At least that's what they were supposed to be doing, but
					more was going into their mouths than into the buckets. They were bound to need
					another bucket soon. Peter went back downstairs, but then the doorbell rang
					twice. Leaving the bucket where it was, Peter raced upstairs and shut the
					bookcase behind him. We sat kicking our heels impatiently; the strawberries
					were waiting to be rinsed, but we stuck to the house rule: "No running water
					when strangers are downstairs — they might hear the drains."
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Jan came up at one to tell us it had been the mail- man. Peter hurried
					downstairs again. Ding-dong. . . the doorbell, about-face. I listened to hear
					if anyone was coming, standing first at the bookcase, then at the top of the
					stairs. Finally Peter and I leaned over the banister, straining our ears like a
					couple of burglars to hear the sounds from downstairs. No unfamthar voices.
					Peter tip- toed halfway down the stairs and called out, "Bep!"
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Once more: "Bep!" His voice was drowned out by the racket in the kitchen. So he
					ran down to the kitchen while I nervously kept watch from above. "Go upstairs
					at once, Peter, the accountant's here, you've got to leave!" It was Mr.
					Kugler's voice. Sighing, Peter came upstairs and closed the bookcase.
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Mr. Kugler finally came up at one-thirty. "My gosh, the whole world's turned to
					strawberries. I had strawber- ries for breakfast, Jan's having diem for lunch,
					Kleiman's eating them as a snack, Miep's bothng them, Bep's hulling them, and I
					can smell them everywhere I go. I come upstairs to get away from all that red
					and what do I see? People washing strawberries!"
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					The rest of the strawberries were canned. That evening: two jars came unsealed.
					Father quickly turned them into jam. The next morning: two more lids popped up:
					and that afternoon: four lids. Mr. van Daan hadn't gotten the jars hot enough
					when he was sterthzing them, so Father ended up making jam every evening. We
					ate hot cereal with strawberries, buttermilk with strawberries, bread with
					strawberries, strawberries for dessert, straw- berries with sugar, strawberries
					with sand. For two days there was nothing but strawberries, strawberries,
					strawberries, and then our supply was either exhausted or in jars, safely under
					lock and key.

				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 8

					"Hey, Anne," Margot called out one day, "Mrs. van Hoeven has let us have some
					peas, twenty pounds!"
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					"That's nice of her," I replied. And it certainly was, but it's so much work. .
					. ugh!
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					"On Saturday, you've aJI got to shell peas," Mother announced at the table.
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					And sure enough, this morning after breakfast our biggest enamel pan appeared
					on the table, filled to the brim with peas. If you think shelling peas is
					boring work, you ought to try removing the inner linings. I don't think many
					people realize that once you've pulled out the linings, the pods are soft,
					delicious and rich in vitamins. But an even greater advantage is that you get
					nearly three times as much as when you eat just the peas.
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Stripping pods is a precise and meticulous job that might be suited to pedantic
					dentists or finicky spice experts, but it's a horror for an impatient teenager
					like me. We started work at nine-thirty: I sat down at ten-thirty, got Up again
					at eleven, sat down again at eleven-thirty. My ears were humming with the
					following refrain: snap the end, strip the pod, pull the string, pod in the
					pan, snap the end, strip the pod, pull the string, pod in the pan, etc., etc.
					My eyes were swimming: green, green, worm, string, rotten pod, green, green. To
					fight the boredom and have something to do, I chattered all morn- ing, saying
					whatever came into my head and making everyone laugh. The monotony was killing
					me. Every string I pulled made me more certain that I never, ever, want to be
					just a housewife!
				-
			-
				Entry 191 - SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					At twelve we finally ate breakfast, but from twelve-thirty to one-fifteen we
					had to strip pods again. When I stopped, I felt a bit seasick, and so did the
					others. I napped until four, still in a daze because of those wretched peas.

				-
					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					We've received a book from the library with the challenging title What Do You
					Think of the Modern Young Girl? I'd like to discuss this subject today.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					The writer criticizes "today's youth" from head to toe, though without
					dismissing them all as "hopeless cases." On the contrary, she believes they
					have it within their power to build a bigger, better and more beautiful world,
					but that they occupy themselves with superficial things, without giving a
					thought to true beauty. In some passages I had the strong feeling that the
					writer was directing her disapproval at me, which is why I finally want to bare
					my soul to you and defend myself against this attack.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I have one outstanding character trait that must be obvious to anyone who's
					known me for any length of time: I have a great deal of self-knowledge. In
					everything I do, I can watch myself as if I were a stranger. I can stand c
					across from the everyday Anne and, without being biased or making excuses,
					watch what she's doing, both the good and the bad. This self-awareness never
					leaves me, and every time I open my mouth, I think, "You should have said that
					differently" or "That's fine the way it is." I condemn myself in so many ways
					that I'm beginning to realize the truth of Father's adage: "Every child has to
					raise itself." Parents can only advise their children or point them in the
					right direction. Ultimately, people shape their own characters. In addition, I
					face life with an extraordinary amount of courage. I feel so strong and capable
					of bearing burdens, so young and free! When I first realized this, I was glad,
					because it means I can more easily withstand the blows life has in store.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					But I've talked about these things so often. Now I'd like to turn to the
					chapter "Father and Mother Don't Understand Me." My parents have always spoiled
					me rotten, treated me kindly, defended me against the van Daans and done all
					that parents can. And yet for the longest time I've felt extremely lonely, left
					out, neglected and misunderstood. Father did everything he could to curb my
					rebellious spirit, but it was no use. I've cured myself by holding my behavior
					up to the light and looking at what I was doing wrong.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Why didn't Father support me in my struggle? Why did he fall short when he
					tried to offer me a helping hand? The answer is: he used the wrong methods. He
					always talked to me as if I were a child going through a difficult phase. It
					sounds crazy, since Father's the only one who's given me a sense of confidence
					and made me feel as if I'm a sensible person. But he overlooked one thing: he
					failed to see that this struggle to triumph over my difficulties was more
					important to me than anything else. I didn't want to hear about "typical
					adolescent problems," or "other girls," or "you'll grow out of it." I didn't
					want to be treated the same as all-the-other— girls, but as Anne— in — her—
					own— right, and rim didn't understand that. Besides, I can't confide in anyone
					unless they tell me a lot about themselves, and because I know very little
					about him, I can't get on a more intimate footing, rim always acts like the
					elderly father who once had the same fleeting im— pulses, but who can no longer
					relate to me as a friend, no matter how hard he tries. As a result, I've never
					shared my outlook on life or my long-pondered theories with anyone but my diary
					and, once in a while, Margot. I've hid any— thing having to do with me from
					Father, never shared my ideals with him, deliberately alienated myself from
					him.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					I couldn't have done it any other way. I've let myself be guided entirely by my
					feelings. It was egotistical, but I've done what was best for my own peace of
					mind. I would lose that, plus the self-confidence I've worked so hard to
					achieve, if I were to be subjected to criticism halfway through the job. It may
					sound hard-hearted, but I can't take criticism from rim either, because not
					only do I never share my innermost thoughts with him, but I've pushed him even
					further away by being irritable.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					This is a point I think about quite often: why is it that rim annoys me so much
					sometimes? I can hardly bear to have him tutor me, and his affection seems
					forced. I want to be left alone, and I'd rather he ignored me for a while until
					I'm more sure of myself when I'm talking to him! I'm still torn with guilt
					about the mean letter I wrote him when I was so upset. Oh, it's hard to be
					strong and brave in every way!
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 9
			-
				-
					Still, this hasn't been my greatest disappointment. No, I think about Peter
					much more than I do Father. I know very well that he was my conquest, and not
					the other way around. I created an image of him in my mind, pictured him as a
					quiet, sweet, sensitive boy badly in need of friendship and love! I needed to
					pour out my heart to a living person. I wanted a friend who would help me find
					my way again. I accomplished what I set out to do and drew him, slowly but
					surely, toward me. When I finally got him to be my friend, it automatically
					developed into an intimacy that, when I think about it now, seems outrageous.
					We talked about the most private things, but we haven't yet touched upon the
					things closest to my heart. I still can't make head or tail of Peter. Is he
					superficial, or is it shyness that holds him back, even with me? But putting
					all that aside, I made one mistake: I used intimacy to get closer to him, and
					in doing so, I ruled out other forms of friendship. He longs to be loved, and I
					can see he's beginning to like me more with each passing day. Our time together
					leaves him feeling satisfied, but just makes me want to start all over again. I
					never broach the subjects I long to bring out into the open. I forced Peter,
					more than he realizes, to get close to me, and now he's holding on for dear
					life. I honestly don't see any effective way of shaking him off and getting him
					back on his own two feet. I soon realized he could never be a kindred spirit,
					but still tried to help him break out of his narrow world and expand his
					youthful horizons.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					"Deep down, the young are lonelier than the old." I read this in a book
					somewhere and it's stuck in my mind. As far as I can tell, it's true.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 11
			-
				-
					So if you're wondering whether it's harder for the adults here than for the
					children, the answer is no, it's certainly not. Older people have an opinion
					about everything and are sure of themselves and their actions. It's twice as
					hard for us young people to hold on to our opinions at a time when ideals are
					being shattered and destroyed, when the worst side of human nature
					predominates, when everyone has come to doubt truth, justice and God.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Anyone who claims that the older folks have a more difficult time in the Annex
					doesn't realize that the problems have a far greater impact on us. We're much
					too young to deal with these problems, but they keep thrusting themselves on us
					until, finally, we're forced to think up a solution, though most of the time
					our solutions crumble when faced with the facts. It's difficult in times like
					these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by
					grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so
					absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite
					of everything, that people are truly good at heart.
				-
			-
				Entry 192 - SATURDAY, JULY 15,1944: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					It's utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos,
					suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a
					wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too,
					I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow
					feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall
					end, that peace and tranquthty will return once more. In the meantime, I must
					hold on to my ideals. Perhaps the day will come when I'll be able to realize
					them!

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 193 - FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					I'm finally getting optimistic. Now, at last, things are going well! They
					really are! Great news! An assassination attempt has been made on Hitler's
					life, and for once not by Jewish Communists or English capitalists, but by a
					German general who's not only a count, but young as well. The Fuhrer owes his
					life to "Divine Providence": he escaped, unfortunately, with only a few minor
					burns and scratches. A number of the officers and generals who were nearby were
					killed or wounded. The head of the conspiracy has been shot.
				-
			-
				Entry 193 - FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					This is the best proof we've had so far that many officers and generals are fed
					up with the war and would like to see Hitler sink into a bottomless pit, so
					they can establish a mthtary dictatorship, make peace with the Allies, rearm
					themselves and, after a few decades, start a new war. Perhaps Providence is
					deliberately biding its time getting rid of Hider, since it's much easier, and
					cheaper, for the Allies to let the impeccable Germans kill each other off. It's
					less work for the Russians and the British, and it allows them to start
					rebuilding their own cities all that much sooner. But we haven't reached that
					point yet, and I'd hate to anticipate the glorious event. Still, you've
					probably noticed that I'm telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
					the truth. For once, I'm not rattling on about high ideals.
				-
			-
				Entry 193 - FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Furthermore, Hitler has been so kind as to announce to his loyal, devoted
					people that as of today all mthtary personnel are under orders of the Gestapo,
					and that any soldier who knows that one of his superiors was involved in this
					cowardly attempt on the Fuhrer's life may shoot him on sight!
				-
			-
				Entry 193 - FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					A fine kettle of fish that will be. kittle Johnny's feet are sore after a long
					march and his commanding officer bawls him out. Johnny grabs his rifle, shouts,
					"You, you tried to kill the Fuhrer. Take that!" One shot, and the snooty
					officer who dared to reprimand him passes into eternal life (or is it eternal
					death?). Eventually, every time an officer sees a soldier or gives an order,
					he'll be practically wetting his pants, because the soldiers have more say-so
					than he does.
				-
			-
				Entry 193 - FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944: Paragraph 6

					Were you able to follow that, or have I been skipping from one subject to

					is making me too happy to be logical! Oh dear, didn't I just get through
					telling you I didn't want to anticipate events? Forgive me, Kitty, they don't
					call me a bundle of contradictions for nothing!

					Dearest Kitty,
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					"A bundle of contradictions" was the end of my previous letter and is the
					beginning of this one. Can you please tell me exactly what "a bundle of
					contradictions" is? What does "contradiction" mean? Like so many words, it can
					be interpreted in two ways: a contradiction imposed from without and one
					imposed from within. The former means not accepting other people's opinions,
					always knowing best, having the last word; in short, all those unpleasant
					traits for which I'm known. The latter, for which I'm not known, is my own
					secret.
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					As I've told you many times, I'm split in two. One side contains my exuberant
					cheerfulness, my flippancy, my joy in life and, above all, my abthty to
					appreciate the lighter side of things. By that I mean not finding anything
					wrong with flirtations, a kiss, an embrace, an off-color joke. This side of me
					is usually lying in wait to ambush the other one, which is much purer, deeper
					and finer. No one knows Anne's better side, and that's why most people can't
					stand me. Oh, I can be an amusing clown for an afternoon, but after that
					everyone's had enough of me to last a month. Actually, I'm what a romantic
					movie is to a profound thinker — a mere diversion, a comic interlude, something
					that is soon forgotten: not bad, but not particularly good either. I hate
					haVing to tell you this, but why shouldn't I admit it when I know it's true? My
					lighter, more superficial side will always steal a march on the deeper side and
					therefore always win. You can't imagine how often I've tried to pmsh away this
					Anne, which is only half of what is known as Anne -to beat her down, hide her.
					But it doesn't work, and I know why.
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					I'm afraid that people who know me as I usually am will discover I have another
					side, a better and finer side. I'm afraid they'll mock me, think I'm ridiculous
					and sentimental and not take me seriously. I'm used to not being taken
					seriously, but only the "lighthearted" Anne is used to it and can put up with
					it: the "deeper" Anne is too weak. If I force the good Anne into the spotlight
					for even fifteen minutes, she shuts up like a clam the moment she's called upon
					to speak, and lets Anne number one do the talking. Before I realize it, she's
					disappeared.
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					So the nice Anne is never seen in company. She's never made a single
					appearance, though she almost always takes the stage when I'm alone. I know
					exactly how I'd like to be, how I am ... on the inside. But unfortunately I'm
					only like that with myself. And perhaps that's why-no, I'm sure that's the
					reason why — I think of myself as happy on the inside and other people think
					I'm happy on the outside. I'm guided by the pure Anne within, but on the
					outside I'm nothing but a frolicsome little goat tugging at its tether.
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					As I've told you, what I say is not what I feel, which is why I have a
					reputation for being boy-crazy as well as a flirt, a smart aleck and a reader
					of romances. The happy-go-lucky Anne laughs, gives a flippant reply, shrugs her
					shoulders and pretends she doesn't give a darn. The quiet Anne reacts in just
					the opposite way. If I'm being completely honest, I'll have to admit that it
					does matter to me, that I'm trying very hard to change myself, but that I I'm
					always up against a more powerful enemy.
				-
			-
				Entry 194 - TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1944: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					A voice within me is sobbing, "You see, that's what's become of you. You're
					surrounded by negative opinions, dismayed looks and mocking faces, people, who
					dislike you, and all because you don't listen to the advice of your own better
					half." Believe me, I'd like !' to listen, but it doesn't work, because if I'm
					quiet and serious, everyone thinks I'm putting on a new act and I have to save
					myself with a joke, and then I'm not even talking about my own family, who
					assume I must be sick, stuff me with aspirins and sedatives, feel my neck and
					forehead to see if I have a temperature, ask about my bowel movements and
					berate me for being in a bad mood, until I just can't keep it up anymore,
					because jj when everybody starts hovering over me, I get cross, then sad, and
					finally end up turning my heart inside g out, the bad part on the outside and
					the good part on the inside, and keep trying to find a way to become what I'd
					like to be and what I could be if ... if only there were no other people in the
					world.
