				brought to the temples] as offerings shall be given unto the persons who [minister
				in the temples; and festivals and processions shall be established in the temples,
				and in all Egypt, in honour of] the King of the South and North, Ptolemy,
				ever-living, beloved of Ptaḥ, the god who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are
				beautiful, each year,

				to the fifth day thereof [and on these days the people shall wear] garlands on
				their heads, and they shall make festal the altars, and shall offer up meat and
				drink offerings, and shall perform everything which it is right and proper to
				perform. And the priests of all the temples which are called after his name
			-
		-
			Verse 51
		-
			-
				shall have, in addition to all the other priestly titles which they may possess,
				the title of "Servant of the god who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are
				beautiful"; [and this title shall be endorsed on all deeds and documents which are
				laid up in the temples]; and they shall cause to be engraved on the rings which
				they wear on their hands, the title of "Libationer of the god who maketh himself
				manifest, whose deeds are beautiful."

		-
			-
				And behold, it shall he in the hands of those who live in the country, and those
				who desire [it], to establish a copy of the shrine of the god who maketh himself
				manifest, whose deeds are beautiful, and set it up in their houses, and they shall
				be at liberty to keep festivals and make rejoicings [before it] each month
			-
		-
			Verse 53
		-
			-
				and each year; and in order to make those who are in Egypt to know [why it is that
				the Egyptians pay honour—as it is most right and proper to do—to the god who maketh
				himself beautiful, whose deeds are beautiful, the priests have decreed] that this
				DECREE shall [be inscribed] upon a stele of hard stone in the writing of the words
				of the gods, and the writing of the books, and in the writing of HAUI-NEBUI (i.e.,
				Greeks), and it shall be set up in the sanctuaries in the temples which [are
				called] by his name, of the first, second, and third [class], near the statue of
				the HORUS, the King of the South and North Ptolemy, ever-living, beloved of Ptaḥ,
				the god who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are beautiful.
