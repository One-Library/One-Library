				Book 1: Paragraph 1
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 1
				-
					-
						Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 2
				-
					-
						Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 3
				-
					-
						Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 4
				-
					-
						With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 5
				-
					-
						Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 6
				-
					-
						Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 7
				-
					-
						Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 8
				-
					-
						That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 9
				-
					-
						In the beginning how the heavens and earth
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 10
				-
					-
						Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 11
				-
					-
						Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 12
				-
					-
						Fast by the oracle of God, I thence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 13
				-
					-
						Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 14
				-
					-
						That with no middle flight intends to soar
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 15
				-
					-
						Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 16
				-
					-
						Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 17
				-
					-
						And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 18
				-
					-
						Before all temples th' upright heart and pure,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 19
				-
					-
						Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 20
				-
					-
						Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 21
				-
					-
						Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 22
				-
					-
						And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 23
				-
					-
						Illumine, what is low raise and support;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 24
				-
					-
						That, to the height of this great argument,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 25
				-
					-
						I may assert Eternal Providence,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 1: Line 26
				-
					-
						And justify the ways of God to men.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 1
				-
					-
						Say first - for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 2
				-
					-
						Nor the deep tract of Hell - say first what cause
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 3
				-
					-
						Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 4
				-
					-
						Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 5
				-
					-
						From their Creator, and transgress his will
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 6
				-
					-
						For one restraint, lords of the World besides.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 2: Line 7
				-
					-
						Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 1
				-
					-
						Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 2
				-
					-
						Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 3
				-
					-
						The mother of mankind, what time his pride
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 4
				-
					-
						Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 5
				-
					-
						Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 6
				-
					-
						To set himself in glory above his peers,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 7
				-
					-
						He trusted to have equalled the Most High,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 8
				-
					-
						If he opposed, and with ambitious aim
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 9
				-
					-
						Against the throne and monarchy of God,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 10
				-
					-
						Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 11
				-
					-
						With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 12
				-
					-
						Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 13
				-
					-
						With hideous ruin and combustion, down
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 14
				-
					-
						To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 15
				-
					-
						In adamantine chains and penal fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 3: Line 16
				-
					-
						Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 4
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 1
				-
					-
						Nine times the space that measures day and night
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 2
				-
					-
						To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 3
				-
					-
						Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 4
				-
					-
						Confounded, though immortal. But his doom
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 5
				-
					-
						Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 6
				-
					-
						Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 7
				-
					-
						Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 8
				-
					-
						That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 9
				-
					-
						Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 10
				-
					-
						At once, as far as Angels ken, he views
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 11
				-
					-
						The dismal situation waste and wild.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 12
				-
					-
						A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 13
				-
					-
						As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 14
				-
					-
						No light; but rather darkness visible
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 15
				-
					-
						Served only to discover sights of woe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 16
				-
					-
						Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 17
				-
					-
						And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 18
				-
					-
						That comes to all, but torture without end
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 19
				-
					-
						Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 20
				-
					-
						With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 21
				-
					-
						Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 22
				-
					-
						For those rebellious; here their prison ordained
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 23
				-
					-
						In utter darkness, and their portion set,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 24
				-
					-
						As far removed from God and light of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 25
				-
					-
						As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 26
				-
					-
						Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 27
				-
					-
						There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 28
				-
					-
						With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 29
				-
					-
						He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 30
				-
					-
						One next himself in power, and next in crime,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 31
				-
					-
						Long after known in Palestine, and named
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 32
				-
					-
						Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 33
				-
					-
						And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 4: Line 34
				-
					-
						Breaking the horrid silence, thus began: -
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 5
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 1
				-
					-
						“If thou beest he - but O how fallen! how changed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 2
				-
					-
						From him who, in the happy realms of light
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 3
				-
					-
						Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 4
				-
					-
						Myriads, though bright! - if he whom mutual league,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 5
				-
					-
						United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 6
				-
					-
						And hazard in the glorious enterprise
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 7
				-
					-
						Joined with me once, now misery hath joined
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 8
				-
					-
						In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 9
				-
					-
						From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 10
				-
					-
						He with his thunder; and till then who knew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 11
				-
					-
						The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 12
				-
					-
						Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 13
				-
					-
						Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 14
				-
					-
						Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 15
				-
					-
						And high disdain from sense of injured merit,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 16
				-
					-
						That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 17
				-
					-
						And to the fierce contentions brought along
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 18
				-
					-
						Innumerable force of Spirits armed,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 19
				-
					-
						That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 20
				-
					-
						His utmost power with adverse power opposed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 21
				-
					-
						In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 22
				-
					-
						And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 23
				-
					-
						All is not lost - the unconquerable will,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 24
				-
					-
						And study of revenge, immortal hate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 25
				-
					-
						And courage never to submit or yield:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 26
				-
					-
						And what is else not to be overcome?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 27
				-
					-
						That glory never shall his wrath or might
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 28
				-
					-
						Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 29
				-
					-
						With suppliant knee, and deify his power
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 30
				-
					-
						Who, from the terror of this arm, so late
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 31
				-
					-
						Doubted his empire - that were low indeed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 32
				-
					-
						That were an ignominy and shame beneath
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 33
				-
					-
						This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 34
				-
					-
						And this empyreal substance, cannot fail;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 35
				-
					-
						Since, through experience of this great event,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 36
				-
					-
						In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 37
				-
					-
						We may with more successful hope resolve
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 38
				-
					-
						To wage by force or guile eternal war,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 39
				-
					-
						Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 40
				-
					-
						Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 5: Line 41
				-
					-
						Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 6
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 6: Line 1
				-
					-
						So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 6: Line 2
				-
					-
						Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 6: Line 3
				-
					-
						And him thus answered soon his bold compeer: -
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 7
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 1
				-
					-
						“O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 2
				-
					-
						That led th' embattled Seraphim to war
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 3
				-
					-
						Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 4
				-
					-
						Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 5
				-
					-
						And put to proof his high supremacy,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 6
				-
					-
						Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 7
				-
					-
						Too well I see and rue the dire event
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 8
				-
					-
						That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 9
				-
					-
						Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 10
				-
					-
						In horrible destruction laid thus low,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 11
				-
					-
						As far as Gods and heavenly Essences
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 12
				-
					-
						Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 13
				-
					-
						Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 14
				-
					-
						Though all our glory extinct, and happy state
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 15
				-
					-
						Here swallowed up in endless misery.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 16
				-
					-
						But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 17
				-
					-
						Of force believe almighty, since no less
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 18
				-
					-
						Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 19
				-
					-
						Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 20
				-
					-
						Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 21
				-
					-
						That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 22
				-
					-
						Or do him mightier service as his thralls
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 23
				-
					-
						By right of war, whate'er his business be,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 24
				-
					-
						Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 25
				-
					-
						Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 26
				-
					-
						What can it then avail though yet we feel
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 27
				-
					-
						Strength undiminished, or eternal being
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 7: Line 28
				-
					-
						To undergo eternal punishment?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 1
				-
					-
						Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied: -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 2
				-
					-
						“Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 3
				-
					-
						Doing or suffering: but of this be sure -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 4
				-
					-
						To do aught good never will be our task,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 5
				-
					-
						But ever to do ill our sole delight,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 6
				-
					-
						As being the contrary to his high will
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 7
				-
					-
						Whom we resist. If then his providence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 8
				-
					-
						Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 9
				-
					-
						Our labour must be to pervert that end,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 10
				-
					-
						And out of good still to find means of evil;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 11
				-
					-
						Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 12
				-
					-
						Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 13
				-
					-
						His inmost counsels from their destined aim.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 14
				-
					-
						But see! the angry Victor hath recalled
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 15
				-
					-
						His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 16
				-
					-
						Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 17
				-
					-
						Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 18
				-
					-
						The fiery surge that from the precipice
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 19
				-
					-
						Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 20
				-
					-
						Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 21
				-
					-
						Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 22
				-
					-
						To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 23
				-
					-
						Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 24
				-
					-
						Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 25
				-
					-
						Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 26
				-
					-
						The seat of desolation, void of light,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 27
				-
					-
						Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 28
				-
					-
						Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 8: Line 29
				-
					-
						From off the tossing of these fiery waves;
					-

						Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,
					-

					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 2
				-
					-
						With head uplift above the wave, and eyes
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 3
				-

						That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 4
				-
					-
						Prone on the flood, extended long and large,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 5
				-
					-
						Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 6
				-
					-
						As whom the fables name of monstrous size,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 7

						Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 8
				-
					-
						Briareos or Typhon, whom the den
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 9

					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 10

						Leviathan, which God of all his works

						Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 12
				-
					-
						Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 13
				-
					-
						The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 14
				-
					-
						Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 15

						With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,

						Moors by his side under the lee, while night

						Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 18
				-
					-
						So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 19
				-
					-
						Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 20
				-
					-
						Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 21
				-
					-
						And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 22
				-
					-
						Left him at large to his own dark designs,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 23
				-
					-
						That with reiterated crimes he might
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 24
				-
					-
						Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 25
				-
					-
						Evil to others, and enraged might see

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 26

						How all his malice served but to bring forth

					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 27
				-
					-
						Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 28
				-
					-
						On Man by him seduced, but on himself
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 9: Line 29
				-
					-
						Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 10
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 1
				-
					-
						Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 2
				-
					-
						His mighty stature; on each hand the flames
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 3
				-
					-
						Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 4
				-
					-
						In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 5
				-
					-
						Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 6
				-
					-
						Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 7
				-
					-
						That felt unusual weight; till on dry land
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 8
				-
					-
						He lights - if it were land that ever burned
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 9
				-
					-
						With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 10
				-
					-
						And such appeared in hue as when the force
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 11
				-
					-
						Of subterranean wind transports a hill
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 12
				-
					-
						Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 13

					-
						Of thundering Etna, whose combustible

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 14
				-
					-
						And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 15
				-
					-
						Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 16
				-
					-
						And leave a singed bottom all involved
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 17
				-
					-
						With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 18
				-
					-
						Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 19
				-
					-
						Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 20
				-
					-
						As gods, and by their own recovered strength,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 10: Line 21

						Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

				Book 1: Paragraph 11

				-
					-
						“Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,”

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 2
				-
					-
						Said then the lost Archangel, “this the seat

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 3
				-
					-
						That we must change for Heaven? - this mournful gloom
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 4
				-
					-
						For that celestial light? Be it so, since he

					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 5

						Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 6
				-
					-
						What shall be right: farthest from him is best

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 7
				-

						Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme

						Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,

					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 9
				-
					-
						Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 10
				-
					-
						Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 11
				-
					-
						Receive thy new possessor - one who brings
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 12
				-
					-
						A mind not to be changed by place or time.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 13
				-
					-
						The mind is its own place, and in itself
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 14
				-
					-
						Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 15
				-
					-
						What matter where, if I be still the same,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 16
				-
					-
						And what I should be, all but less than he
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 17
				-
					-
						Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 18
				-
					-
						We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 19
				-
					-
						Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 20
				-
					-
						Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 21
				-
					-
						To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 22
				-
					-
						Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 23
				-
					-
						But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 24
				-
					-
						Th' associates and co-partners of our loss,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 25
				-
					-
						Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 26
				-
					-
						And call them not to share with us their part
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 27
				-
					-
						In this unhappy mansion, or once more
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 28
				-
					-
						With rallied arms to try what may be yet
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 11: Line 29
				-
					-
						Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 12
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 1
				-
					-
						So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 2
				-
					-
						Thus answered: - “Leader of those armies bright
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 3
				-
					-
						Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 4
				-
					-
						If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 5
				-
					-
						Of hope in fears and dangers - heard so oft
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 6
				-
					-
						In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 7
				-
					-
						Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 8
				-
					-
						Their surest signal - they will soon resume
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 9
				-
					-
						New courage and revive, though now they lie
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 10
				-
					-
						Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 11
				-
					-
						As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 12: Line 12
				-
					-
						No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 13
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 1
				-
					-
						He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 2
				-
					-
						Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 3
				-
					-
						Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 4
				-
					-
						Behind him cast. The broad circumference
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 5
				-
					-
						Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 6
				-
					-
						Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 7
				-
					-
						At evening, from the top of Fesole,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 8
				-
					-
						Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 9
				-
					-
						Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 10
				-
					-
						His spear - to equal which the tallest pine
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 11
				-
					-
						Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 12
				-
					-
						Of some great ammiral, were but a wand -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 13
				-
					-
						He walked with, to support uneasy steps
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 14
				-
					-
						Over the burning marl, not like those steps
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 15
				-
					-
						On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 16
				-
					-
						Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 17
				-
					-
						Nathless he so endured, till on the beach
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 18
				-
					-
						Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 19
				-
					-
						His legions - Angel Forms, who lay entranced
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 20
				-
					-
						Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 21
				-
					-
						In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 22
				-
					-
						High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 23
				-
					-
						Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 24
				-
					-
						Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 25
				-
					-
						Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 26
				-
					-
						While with perfidious hatred they pursued
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 27
				-
					-
						The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 28
				-
					-
						From the safe shore their floating carcases
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 29
				-
					-
						And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 30
				-
					-
						Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 31
				-
					-
						Under amazement of their hideous change.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 32
				-
					-
						He called so loud that all the hollow deep
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 33
				-
					-
						Of Hell resounded: - “Princes, Potentates,

				-
					-
						Warriors, the Flower of Heaven - once yours; now lost,

				-

				-
					-
						If such astonishment as this can seize

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 36
				-
					-
						Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 37
				-
					-
						After the toil of battle to repose
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 38
				-

						Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find

				-
					-
						To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 40
				-
					-
						Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 41
				-
					-
						To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 42
				-
					-
						Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 43
				-
					-
						With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 44
				-
					-
						His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern

				-
					-
						Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 46
				-
					-
						Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 47
				-
					-
						Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 13: Line 48

						Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!”
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 14
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 14: Line 1
				-
					-
						They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung

				-
					-
						Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch

						On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,

						In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;

						Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed

						Innumerable. As when the potent rod

						Then were they known to men by various names,

					-
						At their great Emperorr's call, as next in worth

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 23
				-
					-
						On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 24
				-
					-
						The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 25
				-
					-
						And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 26
				-
					-
						Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 27
				-
					-
						From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 28
				-
					-
						Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 29
				-
					-
						And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond

				-
					-
						The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 31

						Peor his other name, when he enticed

					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 33
				-
					-
						Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 34
				-
					-
						To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 35
				-
					-
						Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 36
				-
					-
						Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 37
				-
					-
						Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 38
				-
					-
						Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 39
				-
					-
						With these came they who, from the bordering flood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 40
				-
					-
						Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 41
				-
					-
						Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 42
				-
					-
						Of Baalim and Ashtaroth - those male,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 43
				-
					-
						These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 44
				-
					-
						Can either sex assume, or both; so soft
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 45
				-
					-
						And uncompounded is their essence pure,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 46
				-
					-
						Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 47
				-
					-
						Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 48
				-
					-
						Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 49
				-
					-
						Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 50
				-
					-
						Can execute their airy purposes,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 51
				-
					-
						And works of love or enmity fulfil.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 52
				-
					-
						For those the race of Israel oft forsook
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 53
				-
					-
						Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 54
				-
					-
						His righteous altar, bowing lowly down
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 55
				-
					-
						To bestial gods; for which their heads as low
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 56
				-
					-
						Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 57
				-
					-
						Of despicable foes. With these in troop
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 58
				-
					-
						Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 59
				-
					-
						Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 60
				-
					-
						To whose bright image nightly by the moon
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 61
				-
					-
						Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 62
				-
					-
						In Sion also not unsung, where stood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 63
				-
					-
						Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 64
				-
					-
						By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 65
				-
					-
						Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 66
				-
					-
						To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 67
				-
					-
						Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 68
				-
					-
						The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 69
				-
					-
						In amorous ditties all a summer's day,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 70
				-
					-
						While smooth Adonis from his native rock
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 71
				-
					-
						Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 72
				-
					-
						Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 73
				-
					-
						Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 74
				-
					-
						Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 75
				-
					-
						Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 76
				-
					-
						His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 77
				-
					-
						Of alienated Judah. Next came one
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 78
				-
					-
						Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 79
				-
					-
						Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 80
				-
					-
						In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 81
				-
					-
						Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 82
				-
					-
						Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 83
				-
					-
						And downward fish; yet had his temple high
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 84
				-
					-
						Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 85
				-
					-
						Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 86
				-
					-
						And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 87
				-
					-
						Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 88
				-
					-
						Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 89
				-
					-
						Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 90
				-
					-
						He also against the house of God was bold:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 91
				-
					-
						A leper once he lost, and gained a king -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 92
				-
					-
						Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 93
				-
					-
						God's altar to disparage and displace
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 94
				-
					-
						For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 95
				-
					-
						His odious offerings, and adore the gods
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 96
				-
					-
						Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 97
				-
					-
						A crew who, under names of old renown -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 98
				-
					-
						Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 99
				-
					-
						With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 100
				-
					-
						Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 101
				-
					-
						Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 102
				-
					-
						Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 103
				-
					-
						Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 104
				-
					-
						The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 105
				-
					-
						Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 106
				-
					-
						Likening his Maker to the grazed ox -
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 107
				-
					-
						Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 108
				-
					-
						From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 109
				-
					-
						Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 110
				-
					-
						Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 111
				-
					-
						Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 112
				-
					-
						Vice for itself. To him no temple stood
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 113
				-
					-
						Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 114
				-
					-
						In temples and at altars, when the priest
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 115
				-
					-
						Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 116
				-
					-
						With lust and violence the house of God?
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 117
				-
					-
						In courts and palaces he also reigns,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 118
				-
					-
						And in luxurious cities, where the noise
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 119
				-
					-
						Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 120
				-
					-
						And injury and outrage; and, when night
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 121
				-
					-
						Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 122
				-
					-
						Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 123
				-
					-
						Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 124
				-
					-
						In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 16: Line 125
				-
					-
						Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 1
				-
					-
						These were the prime in order and in might:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 2
				-
					-
						The rest were long to tell; though far renowned
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 3
				-
					-
						Th' Ionian gods - of Javan's issue held
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 4
				-
					-
						Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 5
				-
					-
						Their boasted parents; - Titan, Heaven's first-born,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 6
				-
					-
						With his enormous brood, and birthright seized
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 7
				-
					-
						By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 8
				-
					-
						His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 9
				-
					-
						So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 10
				-
					-
						And Ida known, thence on the snowy top
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 11
				-
					-
						Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 12
				-
					-
						Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 13
				-
					-
						Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 14
				-
					-
						Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 15
				-
					-
						Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 17: Line 16
				-
					-
						And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.
					-
			-
				Book 1: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						All these and more came flocking; but with looks
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 5
				-
					-
						In loss itself; which on his countenance cast
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 6
				-
					-
						Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 7
				-
					-
						Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 8
				-
					-
						Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 9
				-
					-
						Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 10
				-
					-
						Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 11
				-
					-
						Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 12
				-
					-
						His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 13
				-
					-
						Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 14
				-
					-
						Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 15
				-
					-
						Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 16
				-
					-
						Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 17
				-
					-
						With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 18
				-
					-
						Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 19
				-
					-
						Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 20
				-
					-
						At which the universal host up-sent
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 21
				-
					-
						A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 22
				-
					-
						Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 23
				-
					-
						All in a moment through the gloom were seen
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 24
				-
					-
						Ten thousand banners rise into the air,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 25
				-
					-
						With orient colours waving: with them rose
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 18: Line 26
				-
					-
						A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 62
				-
					-
						Admiring entered; and the work some praise,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 63
				-
					-
						And some the architect. His hand was known
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 64
				-
					-
						In Heaven by many a towered structure high,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 65
				-
					-
						Where sceptred Angels held their residence,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 66
				-
					-
						And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 67
				-
					-
						Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 68
				-

						Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 69

						Nor was his name unheard or unadored
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 70
				-
					-
						In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 71
				-
					-
						Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 72
				-
					-
						From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 73
				-
					-
						Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 74
				-
					-
						To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 75
				-
					-
						A summer's day, and with the setting sun
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 76
				-
					-
						Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 77
				-
					-
						On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 78
				-
					-
						Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 79
				-
					-
						Fell long before; nor aught availed him now
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 80
				-
					-
						To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 81
				-
					-
						By all his engines, but was headlong sent,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 21: Line 82
				-

						With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.

				-
					-
						Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony

						At Pandemonium, the high capital

						From every band and squared regiment
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 8

						By place or choice the worthiest: they anon

				-
					-
						With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 10
				-
					-
						Attended. All access was thronged; the gates
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 11
				-
					-
						And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 12
				-
					-
						(Though like a covered field, where champions bold

						Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 14
				-

						Defied the best of Paynim chivalry

						To mortal combat, or career with lance),

					-
						Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,

					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 17
				-
					-
						Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 18

					-
						In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.

						The suburb of their straw-built citadel,

						New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 24
				-
					-
						Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 25
				-
					-
						Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 26

						Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed

						In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,

						Throng numberless - like that pygmean race

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 30
				-
					-
						Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,
					-
				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 31

						Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side

						Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,

						Though without number still, amidst the hall

				-
					Book 1: Paragraph 22: Line 41

						Frequent and full. After short silence then,

						“Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven! -

						“My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,

				-
					-
						When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 4: Line 29

						Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 4: Line 30

						With what compulsion and laborious flight

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 4: Line 31

				-
					-
						Inexorably, and the torturing hour,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 4: Line 42

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 5: Line 9

						The better reason, to perplex and dash

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 5: Line 10

						And with persuasive accent thus began: -

				-
					-
						“I should be much for open war, O Peers,

						Main reason to persuade immediate war

						In what he counsels and in what excels

						And utter dissolution, as the scope

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 10
				-
					-
						Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 11
				-
					-
						First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 12
				-
					-
						With armed watch, that render all access

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 13

						Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,

						Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 22

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 29
				-
					-
						Though full of pain, this intellectual being,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 30

				-
					-
						Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 35

						Can give it, or will ever? How he can

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 36

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 37

				-
					-
						Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 47

						What when we fled amain, pursued and struck

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 48
				-
					-
						With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 49
				-
					-
						The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 50
				-
					-
						A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 51
				-
					-
						Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 52
				-
					-
						What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 53
				-
					-
						Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 54
				-
					-
						And plunge us in the flames; or from above
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 55
				-

						Should intermitted vengeance arm again

					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 57
				-
					-
						Her stores were opened, and this firmament

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 58

						Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,

						Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 60

					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 61
				-
					-
						Designing or exhorting glorious war,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 62
				-
					-
						Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 63
				-

						Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey

						Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 65

						Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 66
				-
					-
						There to converse with everlasting groans,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 67
				-
					-
						Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 68
				-
					-
						Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 69
				-

						War, therefore, open or concealed, alike
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 70

						My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 71
				-
					-
						With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 72

						Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height

						All these our motions vain sees and derides,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 74

						Not more almighty to resist our might

						Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 76
				-
					-
						Shall we, then, live thus vile - the race of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 77
				-
					-
						Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 78
				-
					-
						Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 79
				-
					-
						By my advice; since fate inevitable
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 80
				-
					-
						Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 81
				-
					-
						The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 82
				-
					-
						Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 83
				-
					-
						That so ordains. This was at first resolved,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 84
				-
					-
						If we were wise, against so great a foe
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 85
				-
					-
						Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 86

						I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 87
				-
					-
						And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 88
				-
					-
						What yet they know must follow - to endure
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 89
				-
					-
						Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 90
				-
					-
						The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 91
				-
					-
						Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 92
				-
					-
						Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 93
				-
					-
						His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 94
				-
					-
						Not mind us not offending, satisfied
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 95
				-
					-
						With what is punished; whence these raging fires
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 96
				-
					-
						Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 97
				-

						Our purer essence then will overcome

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 98

					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 99
				-
					-
						Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 100

						Of future days may bring, what chance, what change
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 6: Line 105

				-
					-
						Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 7: Line 3

						Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake: -

				Book 2: Paragraph 8
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 8: Line 1
				-
					-
						“Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
					-

					Book 2: Paragraph 8: Line 2
				-
					-
						We war, if war be best, or to regain
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 8: Line 3
				-
					-
						Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 8: Line 4
				-

						May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield

					Book 2: Paragraph 8: Line 5
				-
					-
						To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.

				-
					-
						The former, vain to hope, argues as vain

					-
						Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme

						As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 13: Line 4

						Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread
					-

						And god-like imitated state: him round

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 7

						A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed

						Then of their session ended they bid cry

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 10
				-
					-
						With trumpet's regal sound the great result:

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 11
				-
					-
						Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 12
				-
					-
						Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 13
				-
					-
						By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 14
				-
					-
						Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 15
				-
					-
						With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 16
				-
					-
						Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 17
				-
					-
						By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 18

						Disband; and, wandering, each his several way

				-
					-
						Upon the wing or in swift race contend,

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 25

						With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 28

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 29
				-

						Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 30

						To battle in the clouds; before each van

						Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 33

						From either end of heaven the welkin burns.

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 34

						Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 36
				-
					-
						In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar: -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 37
				-
					-
						As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 38
				-
					-
						With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 39
				-
					-
						Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 40
				-
					-
						And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 41
				-
					-
						Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 42
				-
					-
						Retreated in a silent valley, sing
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 43
				-
					-
						With notes angelical to many a harp
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 44
				-
					-
						Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 45
				-
					-
						By doom of battle, and complain that Fate
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 46
				-
					-
						Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 47
				-
					-
						Their song was partial; but the harmony
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 48
				-
					-
						(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 49
				-
					-
						Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 50
				-
					-
						The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 51
				-
					-
						(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 52
				-
					-
						Others apart sat on a hill retired,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 53
				-
					-
						In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 54
				-
					-
						Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 55
				-
					-
						Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 56
				-
					-
						And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 57
				-
					-
						Of good and evil much they argued then,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 58
				-
					-
						Of happiness and final misery,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 59
				-
					-
						Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:

					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 60
				-
					-
						Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy! -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 61
				-
					-
						Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 62
				-
					-
						Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 63
				-
					-
						Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 64
				-
					-
						With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 65
				-
					-
						Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 66
				-
					-
						On bold adventure to discover wide
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 67
				-

						That dismal world, if any clime perhaps
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 68
				-
					-
						Might yield them easier habitation, bend
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 69
				-
					-
						Four ways their flying march, along the banks
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 70
				-
					-
						Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 71
				-
					-
						Into the burning lake their baleful streams -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 72
				-
					-
						Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 73
				-
					-
						Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 74
				-
					-
						Cocytus, named of lamentation loud
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 75
				-
					-
						Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 76
				-
					-
						Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 77
				-
					-
						Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 78
				-
					-
						Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 79
				-
					-
						Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 80
				-
					-
						Forthwith his former state and being forgets -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 81
				-
					-
						Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 82
				-
					-
						Beyond this flood a frozen continent
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 83
				-
					-
						Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 84
				-
					-
						Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 85
				-
					-
						Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 86
				-
					-
						Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 87
				-
					-
						A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 88
				-
					-
						Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 89
				-
					-
						Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 90
				-
					-
						Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 91
				-
					-
						Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 92
				-
					-
						At certain revolutions all the damned
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 93
				-
					-
						Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 94
				-
					-
						Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 95
				-
					-
						From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 96
				-
					-
						Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 97
				-
					-
						Immovable, infixed, and frozen round
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 98
				-
					-
						Periods of time, - thence hurried back to fire.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 99
				-
					-
						They ferry over this Lethean sound
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 100
				-
					-
						Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 101
				-
					-
						And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 102
				-
					-
						The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 103
				-
					-
						In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 104
				-
					-
						All in one moment, and so near the brink;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 105
				-
					-
						But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 106
				-
					-
						Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 107
				-
					-
						The ford, and of itself the water flies
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 108
				-
					-
						All taste of living wight, as once it fled
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 109
				-
					-
						The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 110
				-
					-
						In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 111
				-
					-
						With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 112
				-
					-
						Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 113
				-
					-
						No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 114
				-
					-
						They passed, and many a region dolorous,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 115
				-
					-
						O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 116
				-
					-
						Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 117
				-
					-
						A universe of death, which God by curse
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 118
				-
					-
						Created evil, for evil only good;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 119
				-
					-
						Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 120
				-
					-
						Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 121
				-
					-
						Obominable, inutterable, and worse
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 122
				-
					-
						Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 14: Line 123

						Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.

						Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 2
				-
					-
						Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 3
				-
					-
						Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 4
				-
					-
						Explores his solitary flight: sometimes
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 5
				-
					-
						He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 6
				-
					-
						Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 7
				-
					-
						Up to the fiery concave towering high.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 8
				-
					-
						As when far off at sea a fleet descried
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 9
				-
					-
						Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 10
				-
					-
						Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 11
				-
					-
						Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 12
				-
					-
						Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 13
				-
					-
						Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 14
				-
					-
						Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 15
				-
					-
						Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 16
				-
					-
						Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 17
				-
					-
						And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 18
				-
					-
						Three iron, three of adamantine rock,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 19
				-
					-
						Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 20
				-
					-
						Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 21
				-
					-
						On either side a formidable Shape.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 22
				-
					-
						The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 23
				-
					-
						But ended foul in many a scaly fold,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 24
				-
					-
						Voluminous and vast - a serpent armed
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 25
				-
					-
						With mortal sting. About her middle round
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 26
				-
					-
						A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 27
				-
					-
						With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 28
				-
					-
						A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 29
				-
					-
						If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 30
				-
					-
						And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 31
				-
					-
						Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 32

						Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts

						Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called

					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 35
				-
					-
						In secret, riding through the air she comes,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 36
				-
					-
						Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 37
				-
					-
						With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 38
				-
					-
						Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 39
				-
					-
						If shape it might be called that shape had none
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 40
				-
					-
						Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 41
				-
					-
						Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 42
				-
					-
						For each seemed either - black it stood as Night,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 43
				-
					-
						Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 44
				-
					-
						And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 45
				-
					-
						The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 46
				-
					-
						Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 47
				-
					-
						The monster moving onward came as fast
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 48
				-
					-
						With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 49
				-
					-
						Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 50
				-
					-
						Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 51
				-
					-
						Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 15: Line 52
				-
					-
						And with disdainful look thus first began: -
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 16
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 1
				-
					-
						“Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 2
				-
					-
						That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 3
				-
					-
						Thy miscreated front athwart my way
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 4
				-
					-
						To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 5
				-
					-
						That be assured, without leave asked of thee.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 6
				-
					-
						Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 16: Line 7
				-
					-
						Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 17
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 1
				-
					-
						To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied: -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 2
				-
					-
						“Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 3
				-
					-
						Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 4
				-
					-
						Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 5
				-
					-
						Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 6
				-
					-
						Conjured against the Highest - for which both thou
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 7
				-
					-
						And they, outcast from God, are here condemned
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 8
				-
					-
						To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 9
				-
					-
						And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 10
				-
					-
						Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 11
				-
					-
						Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 12
				-
					-
						Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 13
				-
					-
						False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 14
				-
					-
						Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 15
				-
					-
						Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 17: Line 16
				-
					-
						Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 18
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 1
				-
					-
						So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 2
				-
					-
						So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 3
				-
					-
						More dreadful and deform. On th' other side,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 4
				-
					-
						Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 5
				-
					-
						Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 6
				-
					-
						That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 7
				-
					-
						In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 8
				-
					-
						Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 9
				-
					-
						Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 10
				-
					-
						No second stroke intend; and such a frown
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 11
				-
					-
						Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 12
				-
					-
						With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 13
				-
					-
						Over the Caspian, - then stand front to front
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 14
				-
					-
						Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 15
				-
					-
						To join their dark encounter in mid-air.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 16
				-
					-
						So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 17
				-
					-
						Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 18
				-
					-
						For never but once more was wither like
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 19
				-
					-
						To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 20
				-
					-
						Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 21
				-
					-
						Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 22
				-
					-
						Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 18: Line 23
				-
					-
						Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 19
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 1
				-
					-
						“O father, what intends thy hand,” she cried,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 2
				-
					-
						“Against thy only son? What fury, O son,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 3
				-
					-
						Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 4
				-
					-
						Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom?
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 5
				-
					-
						For him who sits above, and laughs the while
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 6
				-
					-
						At thee, ordained his drudge to execute
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 7
				-
					-
						Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 19: Line 8
				-
					-
						His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 20
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 20: Line 1
				-
					-
						She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 20: Line 2
				-
					-
						Forbore: then these to her Satan returned: -
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 21
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 1
				-
					-
						“So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 2
				-
					-
						Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 3
				-
					-
						Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 4
				-
					-
						What it intends, till first I know of thee
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 5
				-
					-
						What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 6
				-
					-
						In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 7
				-
					-
						Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 8
				-
					-
						I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 21: Line 9
				-
					-
						Sight more detestable than him and thee.”
					-
			-
				Book 2: Paragraph 22
			-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 1
				-
					-
						T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied: -
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 2
				-
					-
						“Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 3
				-
					-
						Now in thine eye so foul? - once deemed so fair
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 4
				-
					-
						In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 5
				-
					-
						Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 6
				-
					-
						In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 7
				-
					-
						All on a sudden miserable pain
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 8
				-
					-
						Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 9
				-
					-
						In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 10
				-
					-
						Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 11
				-
					-
						Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 12
				-
					-
						Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 13
				-
					-
						Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 14
				-
					-
						All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 15
				-
					-
						At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 16
				-
					-
						Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 17
				-
					-
						I pleased, and with attractive graces won
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 18
				-
					-
						The most averse - thee chiefly, who, full oft
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 19
				-
					-
						Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 20
				-
					-
						Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 21
				-
					-
						With me in secret that my womb conceived
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 22
				-
					-
						A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 23
				-
					-
						And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 24
				-
					-
						(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 25
				-
					-
						Clear victory; to our part loss and rout
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 26
				-
					-
						Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 27
				-
					-
						Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 28
				-
					-
						Into this Deep; and in the general fall
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 29
				-
					-
						I also: at which time this powerful key
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 30
				-
					-
						Into my hands was given, with charge to keep
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 31
				-
					-
						These gates for ever shut, which none can pass
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 32
				-
					-
						Without my opening. Pensive here I sat
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 33
				-
					-
						Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 34
				-
					-
						Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 35
				-
					-
						Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 36
				-
					-
						At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 37
				-
					-
						Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 38
				-
					-
						Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 39
				-
					-
						Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 40
				-
					-
						Transformed: but he my inbred enemy
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 41
				-
					-
						Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 42
				-
					-
						Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 43
				-
					-
						Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 44
				-
					-
						From all her caves, and back resounded Death!
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 45
				-
					-
						I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 46
				-
					-
						Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 47
				-
					-
						Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 48
				-
					-
						And, in embraces forcible and foul
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 49
				-
					-
						Engendering with me, of that rape begot
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 50
				-
					-
						These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 51
				-
					-
						Surround me, as thou saw'st - hourly conceived
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 52
				-
					-
						And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 53
				-
					-
						To me; for, when they list, into the womb
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 54
				-
					-
						That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 55
				-
					-
						My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 56
				-
					-
						Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 57
				-
					-
						That rest or intermission none I find.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 58
				-
					-
						Before mine eyes in opposition sits
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 59
				-
					-
						Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 60
				-
					-
						And me, his parent, would full soon devour
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 61
				-
					-
						For want of other prey, but that he knows
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 62
				-
					-
						His end with mine involved, and knows that I
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 63
				-
					-
						Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 64
				-
					-
						Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 65
				-
					-
						But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 66
				-
					-
						His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 67
				-
					-
						To be invulnerable in those bright arms,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 68
				-
					-
						Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 22: Line 69

				-
					-
						Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 50
				-

						He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 51
				-
					-
						With noises loud and ruinous (to compare

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 52

						Great things with small) than when Bellona storms
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 53

						With all her battering engines, bent to rase

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 54

						Of Heaven were falling, and these elements

						In mutiny had from her axle torn

						The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans

					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 58
				-
					-
						He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 59

						Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 62
				-
					-
						A vast vacuity. All unawares,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 63
				-
					-
						Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 64

						Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 70
				-
					-
						Nor good dry land - nigh foundered, on he fares,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 71

						Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.

				-
					-
						With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,

						And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 81
				-
					-
						At length a universal hubbub wild
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 82
				-
					-
						Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,
					-
				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 83
				-

						Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear

						With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies

				-
					Book 2: Paragraph 27: Line 85

						Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power

						Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 2
				-
					-
						Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 3
				-
					-
						May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,

						And never but in unapproached light

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 5

						Won from the void and formless infinite.

						Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 14
				-
					-
						Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 15
				-
					-
						In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 16
				-
					-
						Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 17
				-
					-
						With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 18
				-
					-
						I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 19
				-
					-
						Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 20
				-
					-
						The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 21
				-

						Though hard and rare: Thee I revisit safe,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 22
				-

						And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 23
				-
					-
						Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 24
				-
					-
						To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 25
				-
					-
						So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 26
				-
					-
						Or dim suffusion veil'd. Yet not the more
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 27
				-
					-
						Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 28
				-
					-
						Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 29
				-
					-
						Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 30
				-
					-
						Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 31
				-
					-
						That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 32
				-

						Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget

						Those other two equaled with me in fate

						So were I equall'd with them in renown,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 35
				-
					-
						Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 36
				-
					-
						Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 37
				-
					-
						And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 38
				-
					-
						Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 39
				-
					-
						Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 40
				-
					-
						Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 41
				-
					-
						Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 42
				-
					-
						Seasons return; but not to me returns
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 43
				-
					-
						Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 44
				-
					-
						Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 45
				-
					-
						Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 46
				-
					-
						But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 47
				-
					-
						Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 48
				-
					-
						Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 49
				-
					-
						Presented with a universal blank
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 50
				-
					-
						Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 51
				-
					-
						And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 52
				-
					-
						So much the rather thou, celestial Light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 53
				-
					-
						Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 54
				-
					-
						Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 55
				-
					-
						Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 56
				-
					-
						Of things invisible to mortal sight.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 57
				-

						Now had the Almighty Father from above,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 58
				-
					-
						From the pure empyrean where he sits
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 59
				-
					-
						High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 60
				-

						His own works and their works at once to view:

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 61
				-
					-
						About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 62
				-
					-
						Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 63
				-
					-
						Beatitude past utterance; on his right
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 64
				-
					-
						The radiant image of his glory sat,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 65
				-
					-
						His only son; on earth he first beheld
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 66
				-
					-
						Our two first parents, yet the only two
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 67
				-
					-
						Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 68
				-

						Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 69
				-
					-
						Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 70
				-
					-
						In blissful solitude; he then survey'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 71
				-
					-
						Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 72
				-
					-
						Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 73
				-
					-
						In the dun air sublime, and ready now
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 74
				-
					-
						To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 75
				-
					-
						On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 76
				-
					-
						Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 77
				-
					-
						Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 78
				-
					-
						Him God beholding from his prospect high,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 79
				-
					-
						Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 80
				-
					-
						Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 81
				-
					-
						Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 82
				-
					-
						Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 83
				-
					-
						Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 84
				-
					-
						Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 85
				-
					-
						Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 86
				-
					-
						On desperate revenge, that shall redound
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 87
				-
					-
						Upon his own rebellious head. And now,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 88
				-
					-
						Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 89
				-
					-
						Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 90
				-
					-
						Directly towards the new created world,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 91
				-
					-
						And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 92
				-
					-
						If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 93
				-
					-
						By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 94
				-
					-
						For man will hearken to his glozing lies,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 95
				-
					-
						And easily transgress the sole command,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 96
				-
					-
						Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 97
				-
					-
						He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 98
				-
					-
						Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 99
				-
					-
						All he could have; I made him just and right,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 100
				-
					-
						Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 101
				-
					-
						Such I created all the ethereal Powers
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 102
				-
					-
						And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail'd;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 103
				-
					-
						Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 104
				-
					-
						Not free, what proof could they have given sincere
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 105
				-
					-
						Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 106
				-
					-
						Where only what they needs must do appear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 107
				-
					-
						Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 108
				-
					-
						What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 109
				-
					-
						When will and reason (reason also is choice)
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 110
				-
					-
						Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 111
				-
					-
						Made passive both, had serv'd necessity,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 112
				-
					-
						Not me. They therefore, as to right belong'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 113
				-
					-
						So were created, nor can justly accuse
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 114
				-
					-
						Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 115
				-
					-
						As if predestination over-rul'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 116
				-
					-
						Their will dispos'd by absolute decree
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 117
				-
					-
						Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 118
				-
					-
						Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 119
				-
					-
						Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 120
				-
					-
						Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 121
				-
					-
						So without least impulse or shadow of fate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 122
				-
					-
						Or aught by me immutably foreseen,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 123
				-
					-
						They trespass, authors to themselves in all
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 124
				-
					-
						Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 125
				-
					-
						I form'd them free: and free they must remain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 126
				-
					-
						Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 127
				-
					-
						Their nature, and revoke the high decree
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 128
				-
					-
						Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 129
				-
					-
						Their freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 130
				-
					-
						The first sort by their own suggestion fell,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 131
				-
					-
						Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls, deceiv'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 132
				-
					-
						By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 133
				-
					-
						The other none: In mercy and justice both,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 134
				-
					-
						Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 135
				-
					-
						But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 136
				-
					-
						Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 137
				-
					-
						All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 138
				-
					-
						Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 139
				-
					-
						Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 140
				-
					-
						Most glorious; in him all his Father shone
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 141
				-
					-
						Substantially express'd; and in his face
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 142
				-
					-
						Divine compassion visibly appear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 143
				-
					-
						Love without end, and without measure grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 144
				-
					-
						Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 145
				-
					-
						O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 146
				-
					-
						Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 147
				-
					-
						For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 148
				-
					-
						Thy praises, with the innumerable sound
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 149
				-
					-
						Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 150
				-
					-
						Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 151
				-
					-
						For should Man finally be lost, should Man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 152
				-
					-
						Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 153
				-
					-
						Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd
					-
				-

						With his own folly? that be from thee far,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 155

					-
						That far be from thee, Father, who art judge
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 156
				-
					-
						Of all things made, and judgest only right.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 157

						Or shall the Adversary thus obtain

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 158
				-
					-
						His end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfill
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 159
				-

						His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 160
				-

						Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,

						Yet with revenge accomplish'd, and to Hell

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 162
				-
					-
						Draw after him the whole race of mankind,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 163

						By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself

						Abolish thy creation, and unmake

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 165

						For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 166
				-

						So should thy goodness and thy greatness both

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 168

						O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,
					-

					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 170
				-
					-
						Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 171
				-
					-
						My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 172
				-
					-
						All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 173
				-
					-
						As my eternal purpose hath decreed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 174
				-
					-
						Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 175
				-
					-
						Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 176
				-
					-
						Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 177
				-
					-
						His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 178
				-
					-
						By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 179
				-
					-
						Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 180
				-
					-
						On even ground against his mortal foe;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 181
				-
					-
						By me upheld, that he may know how frail
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 182
				-
					-
						His fallen condition is, and to me owe
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 183
				-
					-
						All his deliverance, and to none but me.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 184
				-
					-
						Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 185
				-
					-
						Elect above the rest; so is my will:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 186
				-
					-
						The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 187
				-
					-
						Their sinful state, and to appease betimes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 188
				-
					-
						The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 189
				-
					-
						Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 190
				-
					-
						What may suffice, and soften stony hearts
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 191
				-
					-
						To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 192
				-
					-
						To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 193
				-
					-
						Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 194
				-
					-
						Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 195
				-
					-
						And I will place within them as a guide,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 196
				-
					-
						My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 197
				-
					-
						Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 198
				-
					-
						And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 199
				-
					-
						This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 200
				-
					-
						They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 201
				-
					-
						But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 202
				-
					-
						That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 203
				-
					-
						And none but such from mercy I exclude.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 204
				-
					-
						But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 205
				-
					-
						Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 206
				-
					-
						Against the high supremacy of Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 207
				-
					-
						Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 208
				-
					-
						To expiate his treason hath nought left,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 209
				-
					-
						But to destruction sacred and devote,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 210
				-
					-
						He, with his whole posterity, must die,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 211
				-
					-
						Die he or justice must; unless for him
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 212
				-
					-
						Some other able, and as willing, pay
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 213
				-
					-
						The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 214
				-
					-
						Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 215
				-
					-
						Which of you will be mortal, to redeem
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 216
				-
					-
						Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 217
				-
					-
						Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 218
				-
					-
						He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 219
				-
					-
						And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 220
				-
					-
						Patron or intercessour none appear'd,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 221
				-
					-
						Much less that durst upon his own head draw
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 222
				-
					-
						The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 223
				-
					-
						And now without redemption all mankind
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 224
				-
					-
						Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 225
				-
					-
						By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 226
				-
					-
						In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 227
				-
					-
						His dearest mediation thus renew'd.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 228
				-
					-
						Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 229
				-
					-
						And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 230
				-
					-
						The speediest of thy winged messengers,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 231
				-
					-
						To visit all thy creatures, and to all
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 232
				-
					-
						Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 233
				-
					-
						Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 234
				-
					-
						Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 235
				-
					-
						Atonement for himself, or offering meet,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 236
				-
					-
						Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 237
				-
					-
						Behold me then: me for him, life for life
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 238
				-
					-
						I offer: on me let thine anger fall;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 239
				-
					-
						Account me Man; I for his sake will leave
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 240
				-
					-
						Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 241
				-
					-
						Freely put off, and for him lastly die
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 242
				-
					-
						Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 243
				-
					-
						Under his gloomy power I shall not long
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 244
				-
					-
						Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 245
				-
					-
						Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 246
				-
					-
						Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 247
				-
					-
						All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 248
				-
					-
						Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 249
				-
					-
						His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 250
				-
					-
						For ever with corruption there to dwell;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 251
				-
					-
						But I shall rise victorious, and subdue
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 252
				-
					-
						My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 253
				-
					-
						Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 254
				-
					-
						Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 255
				-
					-
						I through the ample air in triumph high
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 256
				-
					-
						Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 257
				-
					-
						The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 258
				-
					-
						Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 259
				-
					-
						While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 260
				-
					-
						Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 261
				-
					-
						Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 262
				-
					-
						Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 263
				-
					-
						Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 264
				-
					-
						Of anger shall remain, but peace assured
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 265
				-
					-
						And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 1: Line 266
				-
					-
						Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.
					-
			-
				Book 3: Paragraph 2
			-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 1
				-
					-
						His words here ended; but his meek aspect
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 2
				-
					-
						Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 3
				-
					-
						To mortal men, above which only shone
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 4
				-
					-
						Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 5
				-
					-
						Glad to be offered, he attends the will
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 6
				-
					-
						Of his great Father. Admiration seized
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 7
				-
					-
						All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 2: Line 8
				-
					-
						Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied:
					-
			-
				Book 3: Paragraph 3
			-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 1
				-
					-
						O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 2
				-
					-
						Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 3
				-
					-
						My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 4
				-
					-
						To me are all my works; nor Man the least,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 5
				-
					-
						Though last created, that for him I spare
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 6
				-
					-
						Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 7
				-
					-
						By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 8
				-
					-
						Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 9
				-
					-
						Their nature also to thy nature join;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 10
				-
					-
						And be thyself Man among men on Earth,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 11
				-
					-
						Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 12
				-
					-
						By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 13
				-
					-
						The head of all mankind, though Adam's son.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 14
				-
					-
						As in him perish all men, so in thee,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 15
				-
					-
						As from a second root, shall be restored
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 16
				-
					-
						As many as are restored, without thee none.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 17
				-
					-
						His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 18
				-
					-
						Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 19
				-
					-
						Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 20
				-
					-
						And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 21
				-
					-
						Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 22
				-
					-
						Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 23
				-
					-
						And dying rise, and rising with him raise
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 24
				-
					-
						His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 25
				-
					-
						So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 26
				-
					-
						Giving to death, and dying to redeem,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 27
				-
					-
						So dearly to redeem what hellish hate
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 28
				-
					-
						So easily destroyed, and still destroys
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 29
				-
					-
						In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 30
				-
					-
						Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 31
				-
					-
						Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 32
				-
					-
						Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 33
				-
					-
						Equal to God, and equally enjoying
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 34
				-
					-
						God-like fruition, quitted all, to save
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 35
				-
					-
						A world from utter loss, and hast been found
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 36
				-
					-
						By merit more than birthright Son of God,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 37
				-
					-
						Found worthiest to be so by being good,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 38
				-
					-
						Far more than great or high; because in thee
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 39
				-
					-
						Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 40
				-
					-
						Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 41
				-
					-
						With thee thy manhood also to this throne:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 42
				-
					-
						Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 43
				-
					-
						Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 44
				-
					-
						Anointed universal King; all power
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 45
				-
					-
						I give thee; reign for ever, and assume
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 46
				-
					-
						Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 47
				-
					-
						Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 48
				-
					-
						All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 49
				-
					-
						In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 50
				-
					-
						When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 51
				-
					-
						Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 52
				-
					-
						The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 53
				-
					-
						Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 54
				-
					-
						The living, and forthwith the cited dead
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 55
				-
					-
						Of all past ages, to the general doom
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 56
				-
					-
						Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 57
				-
					-
						Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 58
				-
					-
						Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 59
				-
					-
						Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 60
				-
					-
						Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 61
				-
					-
						The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 62
				-
					-
						New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,

						And, after all their tribulations long,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 64
				-
					-
						See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 65
				-
					-
						With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 66
				-
					-
						Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 67
				-
					-
						For regal scepter then no more shall need,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 68
				-
					-
						God shall be all in all. But, all ye Gods,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 69
				-
					-
						Adore him, who to compass all this dies;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 70
				-
					-
						Adore the Son, and honour him as me.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 71
				-
					-
						No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 72
				-
					-
						The multitude of Angels, with a shout
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 73
				-
					-
						Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 74
				-
					-
						As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 75
				-
					-
						With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 76
				-
					-
						The eternal regions: Lowly reverent
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 77
				-
					-
						Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 78
				-
					-
						With solemn adoration down they cast
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 79
				-
					-
						Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 80
				-
					-
						Immortal amarant, a flower which once
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 81
				-
					-
						In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 82
				-
					-
						Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 83
				-
					-
						To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 84
				-
					-
						And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 85
				-
					-
						And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 86
				-
					-
						Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 87
				-
					-
						With these that never fade the Spirits elect
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 88
				-
					-
						Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 89
				-
					-
						Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 90
				-
					-
						Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 91
				-
					-
						Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 92
				-
					-
						Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 93
				-
					-
						Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 94
				-
					-
						Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 95
				-
					-
						Of charming symphony they introduce
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 96
				-
					-
						Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 97
				-
					-
						No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 98
				-
					-
						Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 99
				-
					-
						Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 100
				-
					-
						Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 101
				-
					-
						Eternal King; the Author of all being,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 102
				-
					-
						Fountain of light, thyself invisible
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 103
				-
					-
						Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 104
				-
					-
						Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 105
				-
					-
						The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 106
				-
					-
						Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 107
				-
					-
						Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 108
				-
					-
						Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 109
				-
					-
						Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 110
				-
					-
						Thee next they sang of all creation first,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 111
				-
					-
						Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 112
				-
					-
						In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 113
				-
					-
						Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 114
				-
					-
						Whom else no creature can behold; on thee
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 115
				-
					-
						Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 116
				-
					-
						Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 117
				-
					-
						He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 118
				-
					-
						By thee created; and by thee threw down
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 119
				-
					-
						The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 120
				-
					-
						Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 121
				-
					-
						Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 122
				-
					-
						Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 123
				-
					-
						Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 124
				-
					-
						Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 125
				-
					-
						Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 126
				-
					-
						To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 127
				-
					-
						Not so on Man: Him through their malice fallen,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 128
				-
					-
						Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 129
				-
					-
						So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 130
				-
					-
						No sooner did thy dear and only Son
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 131
				-
					-
						Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 132
				-
					-
						So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 133
				-
					-
						He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 134
				-
					-
						Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 135
				-
					-
						Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 136
				-
					-
						Second to thee, offered himself to die
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 137
				-
					-
						For Man's offence. O unexampled love,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 138
				-
					-
						Love no where to be found less than Divine!
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 139
				-
					-
						Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 140
				-
					-
						Shall be the copious matter of my song
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 141
				-
					-
						Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 142
				-
					-
						Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 143
				-
					-
						Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 144
				-
					-
						Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 145
				-
					-
						Mean while upon the firm opacous globe
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 146
				-
					-
						Of this round world, whose first convex divides
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 147
				-
					-
						The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 148
				-
					-
						From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 149
				-
					-
						Satan alighted walks: A globe far off
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 150
				-
					-
						It seemed, now seems a boundless continent
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 151
				-
					-
						Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 152
				-
					-
						Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 153
				-
					-
						Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 154
				-
					-
						Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 155
				-
					-
						Though distant far, some small reflection gains
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 156
				-
					-
						Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 157
				-
					-
						Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 158
				-
					-
						As when a vultur on Imaus bred,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 159
				-
					-
						Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 160
				-
					-
						Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 161
				-
					-
						To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 162
				-
					-
						On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 163
				-
					-
						Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 164
				-
					-
						But in his way lights on the barren plains
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 165
				-
					-
						Of Sericana, where Chineses drive
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 166
				-
					-
						With sails and wind their cany waggons light:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 167
				-
					-
						So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 168
				-
					-
						Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 169
				-
					-
						Alone, for other creature in this place,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 170
				-
					-
						Living or lifeless, to be found was none;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 171
				-
					-
						None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 172
				-
					-
						Up hither like aereal vapours flew
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 173
				-
					-
						Of all things transitory and vain, when sin
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 174
				-
					-
						With vanity had filled the works of men:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 175
				-
					-
						Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 176
				-
					-
						Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 177
				-
					-
						Or happiness in this or the other life;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 178
				-
					-
						All who have their reward on earth, the fruits
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 179
				-
					-
						Of painful superstition and blind zeal,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 180
				-
					-
						Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 181
				-
					-
						Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 182
				-
					-
						All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 183
				-
					-
						Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 184
				-
					-
						Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 185
				-
					-
						Till final dissolution, wander here;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 186
				-
					-
						Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 187
				-
					-
						Those argent fields more likely habitants,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 188
				-
					-
						Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 189
				-
					-
						Betwixt the angelical and human kind.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 190
				-
					-
						Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 191
				-
					-
						First from the ancient world those giants came
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 192
				-
					-
						With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 193
				-
					-
						The builders next of Babel on the plain
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 194
				-
					-
						Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 195
				-
					-
						New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 196
				-
					-
						Others came single; he, who, to be deemed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 197
				-
					-
						A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 198
				-
					-
						Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 199
				-
					-
						Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 200
				-
					-
						Cleombrotus; and many more too long,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 201
				-
					-
						Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 202
				-
					-
						White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 203
				-
					-
						Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 204
				-
					-
						In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 205
				-
					-
						And they, who to be sure of Paradise,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 206
				-
					-
						Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 207
				-
					-
						Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 208
				-
					-
						They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 209
				-
					-
						And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 210
				-
					-
						The trepidation talked, and that first moved;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 211
				-
					-
						And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 212
				-
					-
						To wait them with his keys, and now at foot
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 213
				-
					-
						Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 214
				-
					-
						A violent cross wind from either coast
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 215
				-
					-
						Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 216
				-
					-
						Into the devious air: Then might ye see
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 217
				-
					-
						Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 218
				-
					-
						And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 219
				-
					-
						Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 220
				-
					-
						The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 221
				-
					-
						Fly o'er the backside of the world far off
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 222
				-
					-
						Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 223
				-
					-
						The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 224
				-
					-
						Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 225
				-
					-
						All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 226
				-
					-
						And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 227
				-
					-
						Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 228
				-
					-
						His travelled steps: far distant he descries
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 229
				-
					-
						Ascending by degrees magnificent
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 230
				-
					-
						Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 231
				-
					-
						At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 232
				-
					-
						The work as of a kingly palace-gate,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 233
				-
					-
						With frontispiece of diamond and gold
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 234
				-
					-
						Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 235
				-
					-
						The portal shone, inimitable on earth
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 236
				-
					-
						By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 237
				-
					-
						These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 238
				-
					-
						Angels ascending and descending, bands
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 239
				-
					-
						Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 240
				-
					-
						To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 241
				-
					-
						Dreaming by night under the open sky
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 242
				-
					-
						And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 243
				-
					-
						Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 244
				-
					-
						There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 245
				-
					-
						Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 246
				-

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 272

					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 275

						The goodly prospect of some foreign land

						Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 295

						Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,

						He staid not to inquire: Above them all

				-
					-
						The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 300
				-

						Allured his eye; thither his course he bends
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 301
				-
					-
						Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 302
				-
					-
						By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,
					-
				-

					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 304
				-
					-
						Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 305
				-

						That from his lordly eye keep distance due,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 306
				-
					-
						Dispenses light from far; they, as they move
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 307
				-
					-
						Their starry dance in numbers that compute
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 308
				-
					-
						Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 309
				-
					-
						Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 310
				-
					-
						By his magnetick beam, that gently warms

					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 311
				-
					-
						The universe, and to each inward part
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 312
				-
					-
						With gentle penetration, though unseen,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 313
				-
					-
						Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 314
				-
					-
						So wonderously was set his station bright.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 315
				-
					-
						There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 316
				-
					-
						Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 317
				-
					-
						Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 318
				-
					-
						The place he found beyond expression bright,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 319
				-
					-
						Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 320
				-
					-
						Not all parts like, but all alike informed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 321
				-
					-
						With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 322
				-
					-
						If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 323
				-
					-
						If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 324
				-
					-
						Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 325
				-
					-
						In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 326
				-
					-
						Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 327
				-
					-
						That stone, or like to that which here below
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 328
				-
					-
						Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 329
				-
					-
						In vain, though by their powerful art they bind
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 330
				-
					-
						Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 331
				-
					-
						In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 332
				-
					-
						Drained through a limbeck to his native form.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 333
				-
					-
						What wonder then if fields and regions here
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 334
				-
					-
						Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 335
				-
					-
						Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 336
				-
					-
						The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 337
				-
					-
						Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 338
				-
					-
						Here in the dark so many precious things
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 339
				-
					-
						Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 340
				-
					-
						Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 341
				-
					-
						Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 342
				-
					-
						For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 343
				-
					-
						But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 344
				-
					-
						Culminate from the equator, as they now
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 345
				-
					-
						Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 346
				-
					-
						Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 347
				-
					-
						No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 348
				-
					-
						To objects distant far, whereby he soon
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 349
				-
					-
						Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 350
				-
					-
						The same whom John saw also in the sun:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 351
				-
					-
						His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 352
				-
					-
						Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 353
				-
					-
						Circled his head, nor less his locks behind
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 354
				-
					-
						Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 355
				-
					-
						Lay waving round; on some great charge employed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 356
				-
					-
						He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 357
				-
					-
						Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 358
				-
					-
						To find who might direct his wandering flight
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 359
				-
					-
						To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 360
				-
					-
						His journey's end and our beginning woe.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 361
				-
					-
						But first he casts to change his proper shape,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 362
				-
					-
						Which else might work him danger or delay:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 363
				-
					-
						And now a stripling Cherub he appears,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 364
				-
					-
						Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 365
				-
					-
						Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 366
				-
					-
						Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 367
				-
					-
						Under a coronet his flowing hair
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 368
				-
					-
						In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 369
				-
					-
						Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 370
				-
					-
						His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 371
				-
					-
						Before his decent steps a silver wand.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 372
				-
					-
						He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 373
				-
					-
						Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 374
				-
					-
						Admonished by his ear, and straight was known
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 375
				-
					-
						The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 376
				-
					-
						Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 377
				-
					-
						Stand ready at command, and are his eyes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 378
				-
					-
						That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 379
				-
					-
						Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 380
				-
					-
						O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 381
				-
					-
						Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 382
				-
					-
						In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 383
				-
					-
						The first art wont his great authentick will
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 384
				-
					-
						Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 385
				-
					-
						Where all his sons thy embassy attend;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 386
				-
					-
						And here art likeliest by supreme decree
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 387
				-
					-
						Like honour to obtain, and as his eye
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 388
				-
					-
						To visit oft this new creation round;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 389
				-
					-
						Unspeakable desire to see, and know
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 390
				-
					-
						All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 391
				-
					-
						His chief delight and favour, him for whom
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 392
				-
					-
						All these his works so wonderous he ordained,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 393
				-
					-
						Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 394
				-
					-
						Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 395
				-
					-
						In which of all these shining orbs hath Man
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 396
				-
					-
						His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 397
				-
					-
						But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 398
				-
					-
						That I may find him, and with secret gaze
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 399
				-
					-
						Or open admiration him behold,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 400
				-
					-
						On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 401
				-
					-
						Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 402
				-
					-
						That both in him and all things, as is meet,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 403
				-
					-
						The universal Maker we may praise;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 404
				-
					-
						Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 405
				-
					-
						To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 406
				-
					-
						Created this new happy race of Men
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 407
				-
					-
						To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 408
				-
					-
						So spake the false dissembler unperceived;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 409
				-
					-
						For neither Man nor Angel can discern
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 410
				-
					-
						Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 411
				-
					-
						Invisible, except to God alone,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 412
				-
					-
						By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 413
				-
					-
						And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 414
				-
					-
						At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 415
				-
					-
						Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 416
				-
					-
						Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 417
				-
					-
						Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 418
				-
					-
						The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 419
				-
					-
						Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 420
				-
					-
						In his uprightness, answer thus returned.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 421
				-
					-
						Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 422
				-
					-
						The works of God, thereby to glorify
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 423
				-
					-
						The great Work-master, leads to no excess
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 424
				-
					-
						That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 425
				-
					-
						The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 426
				-
					-
						From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 427
				-
					-
						To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 428
				-
					-
						Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 429
				-
					-
						For wonderful indeed are all his works,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 430

						Their number, or the wisdom infinite

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 434
				-

						That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 435
				-
					-
						I saw when at his word the formless mass,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 436
				-
					-
						This world's material mould, came to a heap:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 437
				-
					-
						Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 438
				-
					-
						Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 439
				-
					-
						Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 440
				-
					-
						Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 441
				-
					-
						Swift to their several quarters hasted then
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 442
				-
					-
						The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 443
				-
					-
						And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 444
				-
					-
						Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 445
				-
					-
						That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 446
				-
					-
						Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 447
				-

						Each had his place appointed, each his course;

						The rest in circuit walls this universe.

				-
					-
						With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 451
				-

						That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 452
				-
					-
						His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 453
				-

						Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon

					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 454
				-

						(So call that opposite fair star) her aid

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 455
				-

						Timely interposes, and her monthly round
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 456
				-
					-
						Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 457
				-
					-
						With borrowed light her countenance triform
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 458
				-

						Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 459
				-
					-
						And in her pale dominion checks the night.
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 460
				-

						That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 461

						Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower.

				-
					-
						Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.

				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 463

						Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 464
				-
					-
						As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 465
				-
					-
						Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 466
				-
					-
						Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 467
				-
					-
						Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 468
				-
					-
						Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;
					-
				-
					Book 3: Paragraph 3: Line 469
				-
					-
						Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights.

					O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 2
			-
				-
					The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 3
			-
				-
					Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 4
			-
				-
					Came furious down to be revenged on men,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 5
			-
				-
					Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 6
			-
				-
					While time was, our first parents had been warned
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 7
			-
				-
					The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 8
			-
				-
					Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare: For now
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 9
			-
				-
					Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 10
			-
				-
					The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 11
			-
				-
					To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 12
			-
				-
					Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 13
			-
				-
					Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 14
			-
				-
					Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 15

					Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 16
			-

					Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,

			-
				Book 4: Line 17
			-
				-
					And like a devilish engine back recoils
				-

				Book 4: Line 18

					Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract

				Book 4: Line 20
			-

					The Hell within him; for within him Hell

					He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell

				Book 4: Line 23

				Book 4: Line 25

				Book 4: Line 26

					Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 27

					Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view

				Book 4: Line 28
			-
				-
					Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 29
			-
				-
					Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 30
			-
				-
					Which now sat high in his meridian tower:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 31
			-
				-
					Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.
				-

				Book 4: Line 32
			-

					O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 33
			-
				-
					Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 34
			-
				-
					Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 35
			-
				-
					Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 36
			-
				-
					But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 37
			-
				-
					Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 38
			-
				-
					That bring to my remembrance from what state
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 39
			-
				-
					I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 40
			-
				-
					Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 41
			-
				-
					Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 42
			-
				-
					Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 43
			-
				-
					From me, whom he created what I was
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 44
			-
				-
					In that bright eminence, and with his good
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 45
			-
				-
					Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 46
			-
				-
					What could be less than to afford him praise,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 47
			-
				-
					The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 48
			-
				-
					How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 49
			-
				-
					And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 50
			-
				-
					I 'sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 51
			-
				-
					Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 52
			-
				-
					The debt immense of endless gratitude,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 53
			-
				-
					So burdensome still paying, still to owe,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 54
			-
				-
					Forgetful what from him I still received,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 55
			-
				-
					And understood not that a grateful mind
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 56
			-
				-
					By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 57
			-
				-
					Indebted and discharged; what burden then
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 58
			-
				-
					O, had his powerful destiny ordained
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 59
			-
				-
					Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 60
			-
				-
					Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 61
			-
				-
					Ambition! Yet why not some other Power
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 62
			-
				-
					As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 63
			-
				-
					Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 64
			-
				-
					Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 65
			-
				-
					Or from without, to all temptations armed.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 66
			-
				-
					Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 67
			-
				-
					Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 68
			-
				-
					But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 69
			-
				-
					Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 70
			-
				-
					To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 71
			-
				-
					Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 72
			-
				-
					Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 73
			-
				-
					Me miserable! which way shall I fly
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 74
			-
				-
					Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 75
			-
				-
					Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 76
			-
				-
					And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 77
			-
				-
					Still threatening to devour me opens wide,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 78
			-
				-
					To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 79
			-
				-
					O, then, at last relent: Is there no place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 80
			-
				-
					Left for repentance, none for pardon left?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 81
			-
				-
					None left but by submission; and that word
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 82
			-
				-
					Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 83
			-
				-
					Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 84
			-
				-
					With other promises and other vaunts
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 85
			-
				-
					Than to submit, boasting I could subdue
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 86
			-
				-
					The Omnipotent. Ay me! they little know
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 87
			-
				-
					How dearly I abide that boast so vain,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 88
			-
				-
					Under what torments inwardly I groan,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 89
			-
				-
					While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 90
			-
				-
					With diadem and scepter high advanced,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 91
			-
				-
					The lower still I fall, only supreme
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 92
			-
				-
					In misery: Such joy ambition finds.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 93
			-
				-
					But say I could repent, and could obtain,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 94
			-
				-
					By act of grace, my former state; how soon
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 95
			-
				-
					Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 96
			-
				-
					What feigned submission swore? Ease would recant
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 97
			-
				-
					Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 98
			-
				-
					For never can true reconcilement grow,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 99
			-
				-
					Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 100
			-
				-
					Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 101
			-
				-
					And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 102
			-
				-
					Short intermission bought with double smart.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 103
			-
				-
					This knows my Punisher; therefore as far
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 104
			-
				-
					From granting he, as I from begging, peace;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 105
			-
				-
					All hope excluded thus, behold, instead
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 106
			-
				-
					Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 107
			-
				-
					Mankind created, and for him this world.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 108
			-
				-
					So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 109
			-
				-
					Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 110
			-
				-
					Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 111
			-
				-
					Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 112
			-
				-
					By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 113
			-
				-
					As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 114
			-
				-
					Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 115
			-
				-
					Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 116
			-
				-
					Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 117
			-
				-
					Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 118
			-
				-
					For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 119
			-
				-
					Are ever clear. Whereof he soon aware,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 120
			-
				-
					Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 121
			-
				-
					Artificer of fraud; and was the first
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 122
			-
				-
					That practised falsehood under saintly show,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 123
			-
				-
					Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 124
			-
				-
					Yet not enough had practised to deceive
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 125
			-
				-
					Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 126
			-
				-
					The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 127
			-
				-
					Saw him disfigured, more than could befall
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 128
			-
				-
					Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 129
			-
				-
					He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 130
			-
				-
					As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 131
			-
				-
					So on he fares, and to the border comes
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 132
			-
				-
					Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 133
			-
				-
					Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 134
			-
				-
					As with a rural mound, the champaign head
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 135
			-
				-
					Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 136
			-
				-
					With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 137
			-
				-
					Access denied; and overhead upgrew
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 138
			-
				-
					Insuperable height of loftiest shade,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 139
			-
				-
					Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 140
			-
				-
					A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 141
			-
				-
					Shade above shade, a woody theatre
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 142
			-
				-
					Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 143
			-
				-
					The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 144
			-
				-
					Which to our general sire gave prospect large
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 145
			-
				-
					Into his nether empire neighbouring round.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 146
			-
				-
					And higher than that wall a circling row
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 147
			-
				-
					Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 148
			-
				-
					Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 149
			-
				-
					Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 150
			-
				-
					On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 151
			-
				-
					Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 152
			-
				-
					When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 153
			-
				-
					That landskip: And of pure now purer air
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 154
			-
				-
					Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 155
			-
				-
					Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 156
			-
				-
					All sadness but despair: Now gentle gales,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 157
			-
				-
					Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 158
			-
				-
					Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 159
			-
				-
					Those balmy spoils. As when to them who fail
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 160
			-
				-
					Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past
				-

				Book 4: Line 161
			-
				-
					Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 162
			-
				-
					Sabean odours from the spicy shore
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 163
			-
				-
					Of Araby the blest; with such delay
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 164
			-
				-
					Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 165
			-
				-
					Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 166
			-
				-
					So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 167
			-
				-
					Who came their bane; though with them better pleased
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 168
			-
				-
					Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 169
			-
				-
					That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 170
			-
				-
					Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 171
			-
				-
					From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 172
			-
				-
					Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 173
			-
				-
					Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 174
			-
				-
					But further way found none, so thick entwined,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 175
			-
				-
					As one continued brake, the undergrowth
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 176
			-
				-
					Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 177
			-
				-
					All path of man or beast that passed that way.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 178
			-
				-
					One gate there only was, and that looked east
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 179
			-
				-
					On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 180
			-
				-
					Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 181
			-
				-
					At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 182
			-
				-
					Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 183
			-
				-
					Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 184
			-
				-
					Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 185
			-
				-
					Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 186
			-
				-
					In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 187
			-
				-
					Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 188
			-
				-
					Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 189
			-
				-
					Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 190
			-
				-
					Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 191
			-
				-
					In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 192
			-
				-
					So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 193
			-
				-
					So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 194
			-
				-
					Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 195
			-
				-
					The middle tree and highest there that grew,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 196
			-
				-
					Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 197
			-
				-
					Thereby regained, but sat devising death
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 198
			-
				-
					To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 199
			-
				-
					Of that life-giving plant, but only used
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 200
			-
				-
					For prospect, what well used had been the pledge
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 201
			-
				-
					Of immortality. So little knows
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 202
			-
				-
					Any, but God alone, to value right
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 203
			-
				-
					The good before him, but perverts best things
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 204
			-
				-
					To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 205
			-
				-
					Beneath him with new wonder now he views,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 206
			-
				-
					To all delight of human sense exposed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 207
			-
				-
					In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 208
			-
				-
					A Heaven on Earth: For blissful Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 209
			-
				-
					Of God the garden was, by him in the east
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 210
			-
				-
					Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 211
			-
				-
					From Auran eastward to the royal towers
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 212
			-
				-
					Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 213
			-
				-
					Or where the sons of Eden long before
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 214
			-
				-
					Dwelt in Telassar: In this pleasant soil
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 215
			-
				-
					His far more pleasant garden God ordained;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 216
			-
				-
					Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 217
			-
				-
					All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 218
			-
				-
					And all amid them stood the tree of life,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 219
			-
				-
					High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 220
			-
				-
					Of vegetable gold; and next to life,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 221
			-
				-
					Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 222
			-
				-
					Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 223
			-
				-
					Southward through Eden went a river large,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 224
			-
				-
					Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 225
			-
				-
					Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 226
			-
				-
					That mountain as his garden-mould high raised
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 227
			-
				-
					Upon the rapid current, which, through veins
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 228
			-
				-
					Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 229
			-
				-
					Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 230
			-
				-
					Watered the garden; thence united fell
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 231
			-
				-
					Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 232
			-
				-
					Which from his darksome passage now appears,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 233
			-
				-
					And now, divided into four main streams,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 234
			-
				-
					Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 235
			-
				-
					And country, whereof here needs no account;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 236
			-
				-
					But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 237
			-
				-
					How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 238
			-
				-
					Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 239
			-
				-
					With mazy errour under pendant shades
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 240
			-
				-
					Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 241
			-
				-
					Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 242
			-
				-
					In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 243
			-
				-
					Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 244
			-
				-
					Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 245
			-
				-
					The open field, and where the unpierced shade
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 246
			-
				-
					Imbrowned the noontide bowers: Thus was this place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 247
			-
				-
					A happy rural seat of various view;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 248
			-
				-
					Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 249
			-
				-
					Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 250
			-
				-
					Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 251
			-
				-
					If true, here only, and of delicious taste:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 252
			-
				-
					Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 253
			-
				-
					Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 254
			-
				-
					Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 255
			-
				-
					Of some irriguous valley spread her store,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 256
			-
				-
					Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 257
			-
				-
					Another side, umbrageous grots and caves
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 258
			-
				-
					Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 259
			-
				-
					Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 260
			-
				-
					Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 261
			-
				-
					Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 262
			-
				-
					That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 263
			-
				-
					Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 264
			-
				-
					The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 265
			-
				-
					Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 266
			-
				-
					The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 267
			-
				-
					Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 268
			-
				-
					Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 269
			-
				-
					Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 270
			-
				-
					Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 271
			-
				-
					Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 272
			-
				-
					To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 273
			-
				-
					Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 274
			-
				-
					Castalian spring, might with this Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 275
			-
				-
					Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 276
			-
				-
					Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 277
			-
				-
					Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 278
			-
				-
					Hid Amalthea, and her florid son
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 279
			-
				-
					Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 280
			-
				-
					Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 281
			-
				-
					Mount Amara, though this by some supposed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 282
			-
				-
					True Paradise under the Ethiop line
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 283
			-
				-
					By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 284
			-
				-
					A whole day's journey high, but wide remote
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 285
			-
				-
					From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 286
			-
				-
					Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 287
			-
				-
					Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 288
			-
				-
					Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 289
			-
				-
					Godlike erect, with native honour clad
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 290
			-
				-
					In naked majesty seemed lords of all:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 291
			-
				-
					And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 292
			-
				-
					The image of their glorious Maker shone,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 293
			-
				-
					Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 294
			-
				-
					(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 295
			-
				-
					Whence true authority in men; though both
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 296
			-
				-
					Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 297
			-
				-
					For contemplation he and valour formed;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 298
			-
				-
					For softness she and sweet attractive grace;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 299
			-
				-
					He for God only, she for God in him:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 300
			-
				-
					His fair large front and eye sublime declared
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 301
			-
				-
					Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 302
			-
				-
					Round from his parted forelock manly hung
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 303
			-
				-
					Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 304
			-
				-
					She, as a veil, down to the slender waist
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 305
			-
				-
					Her unadorned golden tresses wore
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 306
			-
				-
					Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 307
			-
				-
					As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 308
			-
				-
					Subjection, but required with gentle sway,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 309
			-
				-
					And by her yielded, by him best received,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 310
			-
				-
					Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 311
			-
				-
					And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 312
			-
				-
					Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 313
			-
				-
					Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 314
			-
				-
					Of nature's works, honour dishonourable,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 315
			-
				-
					Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 316
			-
				-
					With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 317
			-
				-
					And banished from man's life his happiest life,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 318
			-
				-
					Simplicity and spotless innocence!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 319
			-
				-
					So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 320
			-
				-
					Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 321
			-
				-
					So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 322
			-
				-
					That ever since in love's embraces met;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 323
			-
				-
					Adam the goodliest man of men since born
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 324
			-
				-
					His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 325
			-
				-
					Under a tuft of shade that on a green
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 326
			-
				-
					Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 327
			-
				-
					They sat them down; and, after no more toil
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 328
			-
				-
					Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 329
			-
				-
					To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 330
			-
				-
					More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 331
			-
				-
					More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 332
			-
				-
					Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 333
			-
				-
					Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 334
			-
				-
					On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 335
			-
				-
					The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 336
			-
				-
					Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 337
			-
				-
					Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 338
			-
				-
					Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 339
			-
				-
					Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 340
			-
				-
					Alone as they. About them frisking played
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 341
			-
				-
					All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 342
			-
				-
					In wood or wilderness, forest or den;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 343
			-
				-
					Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 344
			-
				-
					Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 345
			-
				-
					Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 346
			-
				-
					To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 347
			-
				-
					His lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 348
			-
				-
					Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 349
			-
				-
					His braided train, and of his fatal guile
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 350
			-
				-
					Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 351
			-
				-
					Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 352
			-
				-
					Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 353
			-
				-
					Declined, was hasting now with prone career
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 354
			-
				-
					To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 355
			-
				-
					Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 356
			-
				-
					When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 357
			-
				-
					Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 358
			-
				-
					O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 359
			-
				-
					Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 360
			-
				-
					Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 361
			-
				-
					Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 362
			-
				-
					Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 363
			-
				-
					With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 364
			-
				-
					In them divine resemblance, and such grace
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 365
			-
				-
					The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 366
			-
				-
					Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 367
			-
				-
					Your change approaches, when all these delights
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 368
			-
				-
					Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 369
			-
				-
					More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 370
			-
				-
					Happy, but for so happy ill secured
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 371
			-
				-
					Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 372
			-
				-
					Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 373
			-
				-
					As now is entered; yet no purposed foe
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 374
			-
				-
					To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 375
			-
				-
					Though I unpitied: League with you I seek,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 376
			-
				-
					And mutual amity, so strait, so close,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 377
			-
				-
					That I with you must dwell, or you with me
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 378
			-
				-
					Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 379
			-
				-
					Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 380
			-
				-
					Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 381
			-
				-
					Which I as freely give: Hell shall unfold,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 382
			-
				-
					To entertain you two, her widest gates,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 383
			-
				-
					And send forth all her kings; there will be room,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 384
			-
				-
					Not like these narrow limits, to receive
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 385
			-
				-
					Your numerous offspring; if no better place,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 386
			-
				-
					Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 387
			-
				-
					On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 388
			-
				-
					And should I at your harmless innocence
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 389
			-
				-
					Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 390
			-
				-
					Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 391
			-
				-
					By conquering this new world, compels me now
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 392
			-
				-
					To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 393
			-
				-
					So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 394
			-
				-
					The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 395
			-
				-
					Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 396
			-
				-
					Down he alights among the sportful herd
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 397
			-
				-
					Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 398
			-
				-
					Now other, as their shape served best his end
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 399
			-
				-
					Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 400
			-
				-
					To mark what of their state he more might learn,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 401
			-
				-
					By word or action marked. About them round
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 402
			-
				-
					A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 403
			-
				-
					Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 404
			-
				-
					In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 405
			-
				-
					Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 406
			-
				-
					His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 407
			-
				-
					Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 408
			-
				-
					Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 409
			-
				-
					To first of women Eve thus moving speech,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 410
			-
				-
					Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 411
			-
				-
					Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 412
			-
				-
					Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 413
			-
				-
					That made us, and for us this ample world,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 414
			-
				-
					Be infinitely good, and of his good
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 415
			-
				-
					As liberal and free as infinite;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 416
			-
				-
					That raised us from the dust, and placed us here
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 417
			-
				-
					In all this happiness, who at his hand
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 418
			-
				-
					Have nothing merited, nor can perform
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 419
			-
				-
					Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 420
			-
				-
					From us no other service than to keep
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 421
			-
				-
					This one, this easy charge, of all the trees
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 422
			-
				-
					In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 423
			-
				-
					So various, not to taste that only tree
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 424
			-
				-
					Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 425
			-
				-
					So near grows death to life, whate'er death is,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 426
			-
				-
					Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 427
			-
				-
					God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 428
			-
				-
					The only sign of our obedience left,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 429
			-
				-
					Among so many signs of power and rule
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 430
			-
				-
					Conferred upon us, and dominion given
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 431
			-
				-
					Over all other creatures that possess
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 432
			-
				-
					Earth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 433
			-
				-
					One easy prohibition, who enjoy
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 434
			-
				-
					Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 435
			-
				-
					Unlimited of manifold delights:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 436
			-
				-
					But let us ever praise him, and extol
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 437
			-
				-
					His bounty, following our delightful task,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 438
			-
				-
					To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 439
			-
				-
					Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 440
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve replied. O thou for whom
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 441
			-
				-
					And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 442
			-
				-
					And without whom am to no end, my guide
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 443
			-
				-
					And head! what thou hast said is just and right.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 444
			-
				-
					For we to him indeed all praises owe,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 445
			-
				-
					And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 446
			-
				-
					So far the happier lot, enjoying thee
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 447
			-
				-
					Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 448
			-
				-
					Like consort to thyself canst no where find.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 449
			-
				-
					That day I oft remember, when from sleep
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 450
			-
				-
					I first awaked, and found myself reposed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 451
			-
				-
					Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 452
			-
				-
					And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 453
			-
				-
					Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 454
			-
				-
					Of waters issued from a cave, and spread
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 455
			-
				-
					Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 456
			-
				-
					Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 457
			-
				-
					With unexperienced thought, and laid me down
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 458
			-
				-
					On the green bank, to look into the clear
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 459
			-
				-
					Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 460
			-
				-
					As I bent down to look, just opposite
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 461
			-
				-
					A shape within the watery gleam appeared,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 462
			-
				-
					Bending to look on me: I started back,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 463
			-
				-
					It started back; but pleased I soon returned,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 464
			-
				-
					Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 465
			-
				-
					Of sympathy and love: There I had fixed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 466
			-
				-
					Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 467
			-
				-
					Had not a voice thus warned me; “What thou seest,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 468
			-
				-
					What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 469
			-
				-
					With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 470
			-
				-
					And I will bring thee where no shadow stays
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 471
			-
				-
					Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 472
			-
				-
					Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 473
			-
				-
					Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 474
			-
				-
					Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 475
			-
				-
					Mother of human race.” What could I do,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 476
			-
				-
					But follow straight, invisibly thus led?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 477
			-
				-
					Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 478
			-
				-
					Under a platane; yet methought less fair,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 479
			-
				-
					Less winning soft, less amiably mild,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 480
			-
				-
					Than that smooth watery image: Back I turned;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 481
			-
				-
					Thou following cryedst aloud, “Return, fair Eve;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 482
			-
				-
					Whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest, of him thou art,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 483
			-
				-
					His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 484
			-
				-
					Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 485
			-
				-
					Substantial life, to have thee by my side
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 486
			-
				-
					Henceforth an individual solace dear;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 487
			-
				-
					Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 488
			-
				-
					My other half:” With that thy gentle hand
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 489
			-
				-
					Seised mine: I yielded; and from that time see
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 490
			-
				-
					How beauty is excelled by manly grace,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 491
			-
				-
					And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 492
			-
				-
					So spake our general mother, and with eyes
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 493
			-
				-
					Of conjugal attraction unreproved,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 494
			-
				-
					And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 495
			-
				-
					On our first father; half her swelling breast
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 496
			-
				-
					Naked met his, under the flowing gold
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 497
			-
				-
					Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 498
			-
				-
					Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 499
			-
				-
					Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 500
			-
				-
					On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 501
			-
				-
					That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 502
			-
				-
					With kisses pure: Aside the Devil turned
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 503
			-
				-
					For envy; yet with jealous leer malign
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 504
			-
				-
					Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 505
			-
				-
					Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 506
			-
				-
					Imparadised in one another's arms,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 507
			-
				-
					The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 508
			-
				-
					Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 509
			-
				-
					Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 510
			-
				-
					Among our other torments not the least,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 511
			-
				-
					Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 512
			-
				-
					Yet let me not forget what I have gained
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 513
			-
				-
					From their own mouths: All is not theirs, it seems;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 514
			-
				-
					One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 515
			-
				-
					Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 516
			-
				-
					Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 517
			-
				-
					Envy them that? Can it be sin to know?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 518
			-
				-
					Can it be death? And do they only stand
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 519
			-
				-
					By ignorance? Is that their happy state,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 520
			-
				-
					The proof of their obedience and their faith?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 521
			-
				-
					O fair foundation laid whereon to build
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 522
			-
				-
					Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 523
			-
				-
					With more desire to know, and to reject
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 524
			-
				-
					Envious commands, invented with design
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 525
			-
				-
					To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 526
			-
				-
					Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 527
			-
				-
					They taste and die: What likelier can ensue
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 528
			-
				-
					But first with narrow search I must walk round
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 529
			-
				-
					This garden, and no corner leave unspied;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 530
			-
				-
					A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 531
			-
				-
					Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 532
			-
				-
					Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 533
			-
				-
					What further would be learned. Live while ye may,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 534
			-
				-
					Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 535
			-
				-
					Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 536
			-
				-
					So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 537
			-
				-
					But with sly circumspection, and began
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 538
			-
				-
					Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 539
			-
				-
					Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 540
			-
				-
					With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 541
			-
				-
					Slowly descended, and with right aspect
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 542
			-
				-
					Against the eastern gate of Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 543
			-
				-
					Levelled his evening rays: It was a rock
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 544
			-
				-
					Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 545
			-
				-
					Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 546
			-
				-
					Accessible from earth, one entrance high;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 547
			-
				-
					The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 548
			-
				-
					Still as it rose, impossible to climb.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 549
			-
				-
					Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 550
			-
				-
					Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 551
			-
				-
					About him exercised heroick games
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 552
			-
				-
					The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 553
			-
				-
					Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 554
			-
				-
					Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 555
			-
				-
					Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 556
			-
				-
					On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 557
			-
				-
					In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 558
			-
				-
					Impress the air, and shows the mariner
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 559
			-
				-
					From what point of his compass to beware
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 560
			-
				-
					Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 561

					Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 562
			-
				-
					Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 563
			-
				-
					No evil thing approach or enter in.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 564
			-
				-
					This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 565
			-
				-
					A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 566
			-
				-
					More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 567
			-
				-
					God's latest image: I described his way
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 568
			-
				-
					Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 569
			-
				-
					But in the mount that lies from Eden north,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 570
			-
				-
					Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 571
			-
				-
					Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 572
			-
				-
					Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 573
			-
				-
					Lost sight of him: One of the banished crew,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 574
			-
				-
					I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 575
			-
				-
					New troubles; him thy care must be to find.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 576
			-
				-
					To whom the winged warriour thus returned.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 577
			-
				-
					Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 578
			-
				-
					Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 579
			-
				-
					See far and wide: In at this gate none pass
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 580
			-
				-
					The vigilance here placed, but such as come
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 581
			-
				-
					Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 582
			-
				-
					No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 583
			-
				-
					So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 584
			-
				-
					On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 585
			-
				-
					Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 586
			-
				-
					But if within the circuit of these walks,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 587
			-
				-
					In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 588
			-
				-
					Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 589
			-
				-
					So promised he; and Uriel to his charge
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 590
			-
				-
					Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 591
			-
				-
					Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 592
			-
				-
					Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 593
			-
				-
					Incredible how swift, had thither rolled
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 594
			-
				-
					Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 595
			-
				-
					By shorter flight to the east, had left him there
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 596
			-
				-
					Arraying with reflected purple and gold
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 597
			-
				-
					The clouds that on his western throne attend.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 598
			-
				-
					Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 599
			-
				-
					Had in her sober livery all things clad;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 600
			-
				-
					Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 601
			-
				-
					They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 602
			-
				-
					Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 603
			-
				-
					She all night long her amorous descant sung;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 604
			-
				-
					Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 605
			-
				-
					With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 606
			-
				-
					The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 607
			-
				-
					Rising in clouded majesty, at length
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 608
			-
				-
					Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 609
			-
				-
					And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 610
			-
				-
					When Adam thus to Eve. Fair Consort, the hour
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 611
			-
				-
					Of night, and all things now retired to rest,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 612
			-
				-
					Mind us of like repose; since God hath set
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 613
			-
				-
					Labour and rest, as day and night, to men
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 614
			-
				-
					Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 615
			-
				-
					Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 616
			-
				-
					Our eye-lids: Other creatures all day long
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 617
			-
				-
					Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 618
			-
				-
					Man hath his daily work of body or mind
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 619
			-
				-
					Appointed, which declares his dignity,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 620
			-
				-
					And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 621
			-
				-
					While other animals unactive range,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 622
			-
				-
					And of their doings God takes no account.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 623
			-
				-
					To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 624
			-
				-
					With first approach of light, we must be risen,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 625
			-
				-
					And at our pleasant labour, to reform
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 626
			-
				-
					Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 627
			-
				-
					Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 628
			-
				-
					That mock our scant manuring, and require
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 629
			-
				-
					More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 630
			-
				-
					Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 631
			-
				-
					That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 632
			-
				-
					Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 633
			-
				-
					Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 634
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 635
			-
				-
					My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 636
			-
				-
					Unargued I obey: So God ordains;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 637
			-
				-
					God is thy law, thou mine: To know no more
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 638
			-
				-
					Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 639
			-
				-
					With thee conversing I forget all time;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 640
			-
				-
					All seasons, and their change, all please alike.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 641
			-
				-
					Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 642
			-
				-
					With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 643
			-
				-
					When first on this delightful land he spreads
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 644
			-
				-
					His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 645
			-
				-
					Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 646
			-
				-
					After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 647
			-
				-
					Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 648
			-
				-
					With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 649
			-
				-
					And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 650
			-
				-
					But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 651
			-
				-
					With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 652
			-
				-
					On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 653
			-
				-
					Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 654
			-
				-
					Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 655
			-
				-
					With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 656
			-
				-
					Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 657
			-
				-
					But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 658
			-
				-
					This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 659
			-
				-
					To whom our general ancestor replied.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 660
			-
				-
					Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 661
			-
				-
					These have their course to finish round the earth,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 662
			-
				-
					By morrow evening, and from land to land
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 663
			-
				-
					In order, though to nations yet unborn,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 664
			-
				-
					Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 665
			-
				-
					Lest total Darkness should by night regain
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 666
			-
				-
					Her old possession, and extinguish life
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 667
			-
				-
					In Nature and all things; which these soft fires
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 668
			-
				-
					Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 669
			-
				-
					Of various influence foment and warm,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 670
			-
				-
					Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 671
			-
				-
					Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 672
			-
				-
					On earth, made hereby apter to receive
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 673
			-
				-
					Perfection from the sun's more potent ray.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 674
			-
				-
					These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 675
			-
				-
					Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 676
			-
				-
					That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 677
			-
				-
					Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 678
			-
				-
					Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 679
			-
				-
					All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 680
			-
				-
					Both day and night: How often from the steep
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 681
			-
				-
					Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 682
			-
				-
					Celestial voices to the midnight air,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 683
			-
				-
					Sole, or responsive each to others note,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 684
			-
				-
					Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 685
			-
				-
					While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 686
			-
				-
					With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 687
			-
				-
					In full harmonick number joined, their songs
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 688
			-
				-
					Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 689
			-
				-
					Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 690
			-
				-
					On to their blissful bower: it was a place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 691
			-
				-
					Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 692
			-
				-
					All things to Man's delightful use; the roof
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 693
			-
				-
					Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 694
			-
				-
					Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 695
			-
				-
					Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 696
			-
				-
					Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 697
			-
				-
					Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 698
			-
				-
					Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 699
			-
				-
					Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 700
			-
				-
					Mosaick; underfoot the violet,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 701
			-
				-
					Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 702
			-
				-
					Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 703
			-
				-
					Of costliest emblem: Other creature here,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 704
			-
				-
					Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 705
			-
				-
					Such was their awe of Man. In shadier bower
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 706
			-
				-
					More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 707
			-
				-
					Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 708
			-
				-
					Nor Faunus haunted. Here, in close recess,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 709
			-
				-
					With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 710
			-
				-
					Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 711
			-
				-
					And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 712
			-
				-
					What day the genial Angel to our sire
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 713
			-
				-
					Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 714
			-
				-
					More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 715
			-
				-
					Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 716
			-
				-
					In sad event, when to the unwiser son
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 717
			-
				-
					Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 718
			-
				-
					Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 719
			-
				-
					On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 720
			-
				-
					Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 721
			-
				-
					Both turned, and under open sky adored
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 722
			-
				-
					The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 723
			-
				-
					Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 724
			-
				-
					And starry pole: Thou also madest the night,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 725
			-
				-
					Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 726
			-
				-
					Which we, in our appointed work employed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 727
			-
				-
					Have finished, happy in our mutual help
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 728
			-
				-
					And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 729
			-
				-
					Ordained by thee; and this delicious place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 730
			-
				-
					For us too large, where thy abundance wants
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 731
			-
				-
					Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 732
			-
				-
					But thou hast promised from us two a race
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 733
			-
				-
					To fill the earth, who shall with us extol
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 734
			-
				-
					Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 735
			-
				-
					And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 736
			-
				-
					This said unanimous, and other rites
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 737
			-
				-
					Observing none, but adoration pure
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 738
			-
				-
					Which God likes best, into their inmost bower
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 739
			-
				-
					Handed they went; and, eased the putting off
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 740
			-
				-
					These troublesome disguises which we wear,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 741
			-
				-
					Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 742
			-
				-
					Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 743
			-
				-
					Mysterious of connubial love refused:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 744
			-
				-
					Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 745
			-
				-
					Of purity, and place, and innocence,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 746
			-
				-
					Defaming as impure what God declares
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 747
			-
				-
					Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 748
			-
				-
					Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 749
			-
				-
					But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 750
			-
				-
					Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 751
			-
				-
					Of human offspring, sole propriety
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 752
			-
				-
					In Paradise of all things common else!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 753
			-
				-
					By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 754
			-
				-
					Among the bestial herds to range; by thee
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 755
			-
				-
					Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 756
			-
				-
					Relations dear, and all the charities
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 757
			-
				-
					Of father, son, and brother, first were known.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 758
			-
				-
					Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 759
			-
				-
					Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 760
			-
				-
					Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 761
			-
				-
					Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,

					Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 764
			-
				-
					His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 765
			-
				-
					Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 766
			-
				-
					Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 767

					Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,

				Book 4: Line 768
			-

					Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,

				Book 4: Line 769
			-

					Or serenate, which the starved lover sings
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 770
			-
				-
					To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 771
			-
				-
					These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 772
			-
				-
					And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 773
			-
				-
					Showered roses, which the morn repaired. Sleep on,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 774
			-
				-
					Blest pair; and O! yet happiest, if ye seek
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 775
			-
				-
					No happier state, and know to know no more.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 776

					Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 777
			-
				-
					Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 778
			-
				-
					And from their ivory port the Cherubim,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 779
			-
				-
					Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 780
			-
				-
					To their night watches in warlike parade;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 781
			-
				-
					When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 782
			-
				-
					Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 783
			-
				-
					With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 784
			-
				-
					Our circuit meets full west. As flame they part,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 785
			-
				-
					Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 786
			-
				-
					From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 787
			-
				-
					That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 788
			-
				-
					Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 789
			-
				-
					Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 790
			-
				-
					But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 791
			-
				-
					Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 792
			-
				-
					This evening from the sun's decline arrived,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 793
			-
				-
					Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 794
			-
				-
					Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 795
			-
				-
					The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 796
			-
				-
					Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 797
			-
				-
					So saying, on he led his radiant files,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 798
			-
				-
					Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 799
			-
				-
					In search of whom they sought: Him there they found
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 800
			-
				-
					Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 801
			-
				-
					Assaying by his devilish art to reach
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 802
			-
				-
					The organs of her fancy, and with them forge
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 803
			-
				-
					Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 804
			-
				-
					Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 805
			-
				-
					The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 806
			-
				-
					Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 807
			-
				-
					At least distempered, discontented thoughts,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 808
			-
				-
					Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 809
			-
				-
					Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 810
			-
				-
					Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 811
			-
				-
					Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 812
			-
				-
					Touch of celestial temper, but returns
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 813
			-
				-
					Of force to its own likeness: Up he starts
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 814
			-
				-
					Discovered and surprised. As when a spark
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 815
			-
				-
					Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 816
			-
				-
					Fit for the tun some magazine to store
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 817
			-
				-
					Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 818
			-
				-
					With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 819
			-
				-
					So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 820
			-
				-
					Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 821
			-
				-
					So sudden to behold the grisly king;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 822
			-
				-
					Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 823
			-
				-
					Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 824
			-
				-
					Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 825
			-
				-
					Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 826
			-
				-
					Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 827
			-
				-
					Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 828
			-
				-
					Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 829
			-
				-
					For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 830
			-
				-
					Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 831
			-
				-
					The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 832
			-
				-
					Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 833
			-
				-
					Your message, like to end as much in vain?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 834
			-
				-
					To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 835
			-
				-
					Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 836
			-
				-
					Or undiminished brightness to be known,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 837
			-
				-
					As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 838
			-
				-
					That glory then, when thou no more wast good,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 839
			-
				-
					Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 840
			-
				-
					Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 841
			-
				-
					But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 842
			-
				-
					To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 843
			-
				-
					This place inviolable, and these from harm.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 844
			-
				-
					So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 845
			-
				-
					Severe in youthful beauty, added grace
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 846
			-
				-
					Invincible: Abashed the Devil stood,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 847
			-
				-
					And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 848
			-
				-
					Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 849
			-
				-
					His loss; but chiefly to find here observed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 850
			-
				-
					His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 851
			-
				-
					Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 852
			-
				-
					Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 853
			-
				-
					Or all at once; more glory will be won,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 854
			-
				-
					Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 855
			-
				-
					Will save us trial what the least can do
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 856
			-
				-
					Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 857
			-
				-
					The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 858
			-
				-
					But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 859
			-
				-
					Champing his iron curb: To strive or fly
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 860
			-
				-
					He held it vain; awe from above had quelled
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 861
			-
				-
					His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 862
			-
				-
					The western point, where those half-rounding guards
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 863
			-
				-
					Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 864
			-
				-
					A waiting next command. To whom their Chief,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 865
			-
				-
					Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 866
			-
				-
					O friends! I hear the tread of nimble feet
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 867
			-
				-
					Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 868
			-
				-
					Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 869
			-
				-
					And with them comes a third of regal port,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 870
			-
				-
					But faded splendour wan; who by his gait
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 871
			-
				-
					And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 872
			-
				-
					Not likely to part hence without contest;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 873
			-
				-
					Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 874
			-
				-
					He scarce had ended, when those two approached,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 875
			-
				-
					And brief related whom they brought, where found,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 876
			-
				-
					How busied, in what form and posture couched.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 877
			-
				-
					To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 878
			-
				-
					Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 879
			-
				-
					To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 880
			-
				-
					Of others, who approve not to transgress
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 881
			-
				-
					By thy example, but have power and right
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 882
			-
				-
					To question thy bold entrance on this place;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 883
			-
				-
					Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 884
			-
				-
					Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 885
			-
				-
					To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 886
			-
				-
					Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 887
			-
				-
					And such I held thee; but this question asked
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 888
			-
				-
					Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 889
			-
				-
					Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 890
			-
				-
					Though thither doomed! Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 891
			-
				-
					And boldly venture to whatever place
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 892
			-
				-
					Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 893
			-
				-
					Torment with ease, and soonest recompense
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 894
			-
				-
					Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 895
			-
				-
					To thee no reason, who knowest only good,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 896
			-
				-
					But evil hast not tried: and wilt object
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 897
			-
				-
					His will who bounds us! Let him surer bar
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 898
			-
				-
					His iron gates, if he intends our stay
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 899
			-
				-
					In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 900
			-
				-
					The rest is true, they found me where they say;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 901
			-
				-
					But that implies not violence or harm.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 902
			-
				-
					Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 903
			-
				-
					Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 904
			-
				-
					O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 905
			-
				-
					Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 906
			-
				-
					And now returns him from his prison 'scaped,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 907
			-
				-
					Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 908
			-
				-
					Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 909
			-
				-
					Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 910
			-
				-
					So wise he judges it to fly from pain
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 911
			-
				-
					However, and to 'scape his punishment!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 912
			-
				-
					So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 913
			-
				-
					Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 914
			-
				-
					Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 915
			-
				-
					Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 916
			-
				-
					Can equal anger infinite provoked.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 917
			-
				-
					But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 918
			-
				-
					Came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 919
			-
				-
					Less pain, less to be fled? or thou than they
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 920
			-
				-
					Less hardy to endure? Courageous Chief!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 921
			-
				-
					The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 922
			-
				-
					To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 923
			-
				-
					Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 924
			-
				-
					To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 925
			-
				-
					Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 926
			-
				-
					Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 927
			-
				-
					Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 928
			-
				-
					The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 929
			-
				-
					And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 930
			-
				-
					But still thy words at random, as before,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 931
			-
				-
					Argue thy inexperience what behoves
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 932
			-
				-
					From hard assays and ill successes past
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 933
			-
				-
					A faithful leader, not to hazard all
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 934
			-
				-
					Through ways of danger by himself untried:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 935
			-
				-
					I, therefore, I alone first undertook
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 936
			-
				-
					To wing the desolate abyss, and spy
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 937
			-
				-
					This new created world, whereof in Hell
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 938
			-
				-
					Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 939
			-
				-
					Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 940
			-
				-
					To settle here on earth, or in mid air;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 941
			-
				-
					Though for possession put to try once more
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 942
			-
				-
					What thou and thy gay legions dare against;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 943
			-
				-
					Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 944
			-
				-
					High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 945
			-
				-
					And practised distances to cringe, not fight,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 946
			-
				-
					To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 947
			-
				-
					To say and straight unsay, pretending first
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 948
			-
				-
					Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 949
			-
				-
					Argues no leader but a liar traced,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 950
			-
				-
					Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 951
			-
				-
					O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 952
			-
				-
					Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 953
			-
				-
					Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 954
			-
				-
					Was this your discipline and faith engaged,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 955
			-
				-
					Your military obedience, to dissolve
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 956
			-
				-
					Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 957
			-
				-
					And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 958
			-
				-
					Patron of liberty, who more than thou
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 959
			-
				-
					Once fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 960
			-
				-
					Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 961
			-
				-
					To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 962
			-
				-
					But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 963
			-
				-
					Fly neither whence thou fledst! If from this hour
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 964
			-
				-
					Within these hallowed limits thou appear,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 965
			-
				-
					Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 966
			-
				-
					And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 967
			-
				-
					The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 968
			-
				-
					So threatened he; but Satan to no threats
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 969
			-
				-
					Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 970
			-
				-
					Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 971
			-
				-
					Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 972
			-
				-
					Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 973
			-
				-
					From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 974
			-
				-
					Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 975
			-
				-
					Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 976
			-
				-
					In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 977
			-
				-
					While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 978
			-
				-
					Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 979
			-
				-
					Their phalanx, and began to hem him round
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 980
			-
				-
					With ported spears, as thick as when a field
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 981
			-
				-
					Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 982
			-
				-
					Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 983
			-
				-
					Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 984
			-
				-
					Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 985
			-
				-
					Prove chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 986
			-
				-
					Collecting all his might, dilated stood,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 987
			-
				-
					Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 988
			-
				-
					His stature reached the sky, and on his crest
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 989
			-
				-
					Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 990
			-
				-
					What seemed both spear and shield: Now dreadful deeds
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 991
			-
				-
					Might have ensued, nor only Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 992
			-
				-
					In this commotion, but the starry cope
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 993
			-
				-
					Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 994
			-
				-
					At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 995
			-
				-
					With violence of this conflict, had not soon
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 996
			-
				-
					The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 997
			-
				-
					Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 998
			-
				-
					Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 999
			-
				-
					Wherein all things created first he weighed,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1000
			-
				-
					The pendulous round earth with balanced air
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1001
			-
				-
					In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1002
			-
				-
					Battles and realms: In these he put two weights,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1003
			-
				-
					The sequel each of parting and of fight:
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1004
			-
				-
					The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1005
			-
				-
					Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1006
			-
				-
					Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1007
			-
				-
					Neither our own, but given: What folly then
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1008
			-
				-
					To boast what arms can do? since thine no more
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1009
			-
				-
					Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1010
			-
				-
					To trample thee as mire: For proof look up,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1011
			-
				-
					And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1012
			-
				-
					Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1013
			-
				-
					If thou resist. The Fiend looked up, and knew
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1014
			-
				-
					His mounted scale aloft: Nor more; but fled
				-
			-
				Book 4: Line 1015
			-
				-
					Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
				-
		-
			Book 5
		-
			-
				Book 5: Line 1
			-
				-
					Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 2
			-
				-
					Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 3
			-
				-
					When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 4
			-
				-
					Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 5
			-
				-
					And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 6
			-
				-
					Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 7
			-
				-
					Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 8
			-
				-
					Of birds on every bough; so much the more
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 9
			-
				-
					His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 10
			-
				-
					With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 11
			-
				-
					As through unquiet rest: He, on his side
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 12
			-
				-
					Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 13
			-
				-
					Hung over her enamoured, and beheld
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 14
			-
				-
					Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 15
			-
				-
					Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 16
			-
				-
					Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 17
			-
				-
					Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 18
			-
				-
					My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 19
			-
				-
					Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 20
			-
				-
					Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 21
			-
				-
					Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 22
			-
				-
					Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 23
			-
				-
					What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 24
			-
				-
					How nature paints her colours, how the bee
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 25
			-
				-
					Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 26
			-
				-
					Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 27
			-
				-
					On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 28
			-
				-
					O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 29
			-
				-
					My glory, my perfection! glad I see
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 30
			-
				-
					Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 31
			-
				-
					(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 32
			-
				-
					If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 33
			-
				-
					Works of day past, or morrow's next design,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 34
			-
				-
					But of offence and trouble, which my mind
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 35
			-
				-
					Knew never till this irksome night: Methought,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 36
			-
				-
					Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 37
			-
				-
					With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 38
			-
				-
					“Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 39
			-
				-
					The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 40
			-
				-
					To the night-warbling bird, that now awake
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 41
			-
				-
					Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 42
			-
				-
					Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 43
			-
				-
					Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 44
			-
				-
					If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 45
			-
				-
					Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 46
			-
				-
					In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 47
			-
				-
					Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.”
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 48
			-
				-
					I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 49
			-
				-
					To find thee I directed then my walk;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 50
			-
				-
					And on, methought, alone I passed through ways
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 51
			-
				-
					That brought me on a sudden to the tree
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 52
			-
				-
					Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 53
			-
				-
					Much fairer to my fancy than by day:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 54
			-
				-
					And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 55
			-
				-
					One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 56
			-
				-
					By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 57
			-
				-
					Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 58
			-
				-
					And “O fair plant,” said he, “with fruit surcharged,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 59
			-
				-
					Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 60
			-
				-
					Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 61
			-
				-
					Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 62
			-
				-
					Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 63
			-
				-
					Longer thy offered good; why else set here?”
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 64
			-
				-
					This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 65
			-
				-
					He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 66
			-
				-
					At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 67
			-
				-
					But he thus, overjoyed; “O fruit divine,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 68
			-
				-
					Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 69
			-
				-
					Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 70
			-
				-
					For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 71
			-
				-
					And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 72
			-
				-
					Communicated, more abundant grows,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 73
			-
				-
					The author not impaired, but honoured more?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 74
			-
				-
					Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 75
			-
				-
					Partake thou also; happy though thou art,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 76
			-
				-
					Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 77
			-
				-
					Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 78
			-
				-
					Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 79
			-
				-
					But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 80
			-
				-
					Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 81
			-
				-
					What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!”
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 82
			-
				-
					So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 83
			-
				-
					Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 84
			-
				-
					Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 85
			-
				-
					So quickened appetite, that I, methought,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 86
			-
				-
					Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 87
			-
				-
					With him I flew, and underneath beheld
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 88
			-
				-
					The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 89
			-
				-
					And various: Wondering at my flight and change
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 90
			-
				-
					To this high exaltation; suddenly
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 91
			-
				-
					My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 92
			-
				-
					And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 93
			-
				-
					To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 94
			-
				-
					Related, and thus Adam answered sad.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 95
			-
				-
					Best image of myself, and dearer half,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 96
			-
				-
					The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 97
			-
				-
					Affects me equally; nor can I like
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 98
			-
				-
					This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 99
			-
				-
					Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 100
			-
				-
					Created pure. But know that in the soul
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 101
			-
				-
					Are many lesser faculties, that serve
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 102
			-
				-
					Reason as chief; among these Fancy next
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 103
			-
				-
					Her office holds; of all external things
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 104
			-
				-
					Which the five watchful senses represent,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 105
			-
				-
					She forms imaginations, aery shapes,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 106
			-
				-
					Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 107
			-
				-
					All what we affirm or what deny, and call
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 108
			-
				-
					Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 109
			-
				-
					Into her private cell, when nature rests.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 110
			-
				-
					Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 111
			-
				-
					To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 112
			-
				-
					Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 113
			-
				-
					Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 114
			-
				-
					Some such resemblances, methinks, I find
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 115
			-
				-
					Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 116
			-
				-
					But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 117
			-
				-
					Evil into the mind of God or Man
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 118
			-
				-
					May come and go, so unreproved, and leave
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 119
			-
				-
					No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 120
			-
				-
					That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 121
			-
				-
					Waking thou never will consent to do.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 122
			-
				-
					Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 123
			-
				-
					That wont to be more cheerful and serene,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 124
			-
				-
					Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 125
			-
				-
					And let us to our fresh employments rise
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 126
			-
				-
					Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 127
			-
				-
					That open now their choisest bosomed smells,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 128
			-
				-
					Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 129
			-
				-
					So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 130
			-
				-
					But silently a gentle tear let fall
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 131
			-
				-
					From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 132
			-
				-
					Two other precious drops that ready stood,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 133
			-
				-
					Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 134
			-
				-
					Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 135
			-
				-
					And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 136
			-
				-
					So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 137
			-
				-
					But first, from under shady arborous roof
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 138
			-
				-
					Soon as they forth were come to open sight
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 139
			-
				-
					Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 140
			-
				-
					With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 141
			-
				-
					Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 142
			-
				-
					Discovering in wide landskip all the east
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 143
			-
				-
					Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 144
			-
				-
					Lowly they bowed adoring, and began
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 145
			-
				-
					Their orisons, each morning duly paid
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 146
			-
				-
					In various style; for neither various style

					Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
				-

				Book 5: Line 148
			-
				-
					Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 149
			-
				-
					Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 150
			-
				-
					Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 151
			-
				-
					More tuneable than needed lute or harp
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 152
			-
				-
					To add more sweetness; and they thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 153
			-
				-
					These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 154
			-
				-
					Almighty! Thine this universal frame,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 155
			-
				-
					Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 156

					Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens
				-

					In these thy lowest works; yet these declare
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 159
			-
				-
					Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 160
			-
				-
					Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 161
			-
				-
					Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 162
			-
				-
					And choral symphonies, day without night,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 163

					Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven

					Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.

					Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,

				Book 5: Line 167

				-
					If better thou belong not to the dawn,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 168
			-
				-
					Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 169
			-

					While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.

					Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,

					Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise
				-

				Book 5: Line 173
			-
				-
					In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,

				-
					And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.

			-
				Book 5: Line 175

				-
					Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 176

				-
					With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 177
			-
				-
					And ye five other wandering Fires, that move
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 178
			-
				-
					In mystick dance not without song, resound
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 179
			-

					His praise, who out of darkness called up light.

				-
					Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth

			-
				Book 5: Line 181

					And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change

				Book 5: Line 184
			-
				-
					Vary to our great Maker still new praise.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 185
			-
				-
					Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 186
			-
				-
					From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 187
			-
				-
					Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 188
			-
				-
					In honour to the world's great Author rise;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 189
			-
				-
					Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 190
			-
				-
					Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 191
			-
				-
					Rising or falling still advance his praise.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 192
			-
				-
					His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 193
			-
				-
					Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 194
			-
				-
					With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 195
			-
				-
					Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 196
			-
				-
					Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 197
			-
				-
					Join voices, all ye living Souls: Ye Birds,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 198
			-
				-
					That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 199
			-
				-
					Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 200
			-
				-
					Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 201
			-
				-
					The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 202
			-
				-
					Witness if I be silent, morn or even,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 203
			-
				-
					To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 204
			-
				-
					Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 205
			-
				-
					Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 206
			-
				-
					To give us only good; and if the night
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 207
			-
				-
					Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 208
			-
				-
					Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 209
			-
				-
					So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 210
			-
				-
					Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 211
			-
				-
					On to their morning's rural work they haste,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 212
			-
				-
					Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 213
			-
				-
					Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 214
			-
				-
					Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 215
			-
				-
					Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 216
			-
				-
					To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 217
			-
				-
					Her marriageable arms, and with him brings
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 218
			-
				-
					Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 219
			-
				-
					His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 220
			-
				-
					With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 221
			-
				-
					Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 222
			-
				-
					To travel with Tobias, and secured
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 223
			-
				-
					His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 224
			-
				-
					Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 225
			-
				-
					Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 226
			-
				-
					Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 227
			-
				-
					This night the human pair; how he designs
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 228
			-
				-
					In them at once to ruin all mankind.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 229
			-
				-
					Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 230
			-
				-
					Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 231
			-
				-
					Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 232
			-
				-
					To respite his day-labour with repast,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 233
			-
				-
					Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 234
			-
				-
					As may advise him of his happy state,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 235
			-
				-
					Happiness in his power left free to will,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 236
			-
				-
					Left to his own free will, his will though free,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 237
			-
				-
					Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 238
			-
				-
					He swerve not, too secure: Tell him withal
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 239
			-
				-
					His danger, and from whom; what enemy,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 240
			-
				-
					Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 241
			-
				-
					The fall of others from like state of bliss;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 242
			-
				-
					By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 243
			-
				-
					But by deceit and lies: This let him know,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 244
			-
				-
					Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 245
			-
				-
					Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 246
			-
				-
					So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 247
			-
				-
					All justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 248
			-
				-
					After his charge received; but from among
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 249
			-
				-
					Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 250
			-
				-
					Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 251
			-
				-
					Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 252
			-
				-
					On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 253
			-
				-
					Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 254
			-
				-
					Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 255
			-
				-
					On golden hinges turning, as by work
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 256
			-
				-
					Divine the sovran Architect had framed.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 257
			-
				-
					From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 258
			-
				-
					Star interposed, however small he sees,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 259
			-
				-
					Not unconformed to other shining globes,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 260
			-
				-
					Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 261
			-
				-
					Above all hills. As when by night the glass
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 262
			-
				-
					Of Galileo, less assured, observes
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 263
			-
				-
					Imagined lands and regions in the moon:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 264
			-
				-
					Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 265
			-
				-
					Delos or Samos first appearing, kens
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 266
			-
				-
					A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 267
			-
				-
					He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 268
			-
				-
					Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 269
			-
				-
					Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 270
			-
				-
					Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 271
			-
				-
					Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 272
			-
				-
					A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 273
			-
				-
					When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 274
			-
				-
					Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 275
			-
				-
					At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 276
			-
				-
					He lights, and to his proper shape returns
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 277
			-
				-
					A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 278
			-
				-
					His lineaments divine; the pair that clad
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 279
			-
				-
					Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 280
			-
				-
					With regal ornament; the middle pair
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 281
			-
				-
					Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 282
			-
				-
					Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 283
			-
				-
					And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 284
			-
				-
					Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 285
			-
				-
					Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 286
			-
				-
					And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 287
			-
				-
					The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 288
			-
				-
					Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 289
			-
				-
					And to his message high, in honour rise;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 290
			-
				-
					For on some message high they guessed him bound.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 291
			-
				-
					Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 292
			-
				-
					Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 293
			-
				-
					And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 294
			-
				-
					A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 295
			-
				-
					Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 296
			-
				-
					Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 297
			-
				-
					Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 298
			-
				-
					Him through the spicy forest onward come
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 299
			-
				-
					Adam discerned, as in the door he sat
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 300
			-
				-
					Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 301
			-
				-
					Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 302
			-
				-
					Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 303
			-
				-
					And Eve within, due at her hour prepared
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 304
			-
				-
					For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 305
			-
				-
					True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 306
			-
				-
					Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 307
			-
				-
					Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 308
			-
				-
					Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 309
			-
				-
					Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 310
			-
				-
					Comes this way moving; seems another morn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 311
			-
				-
					Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 312
			-
				-
					To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 313
			-
				-
					This day to be our guest. But go with speed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 314
			-
				-
					And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 315
			-
				-
					Abundance, fit to honour and receive
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 316
			-
				-
					Our heavenly stranger: Well we may afford
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 317
			-
				-
					Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 318
			-
				-
					From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 319
			-
				-
					Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 320
			-
				-
					More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 321
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve. Adam, earth's hallowed mould,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 322
			-
				-
					Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 323
			-
				-
					All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 324
			-
				-
					Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 325
			-
				-
					To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 326
			-
				-
					But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 327
			-
				-
					Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 328
			-
				-
					To entertain our Angel-guest, as he
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 329
			-
				-
					Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 330
			-
				-
					God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 331
			-
				-
					So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 332
			-
				-
					She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 333
			-
				-
					What choice to choose for delicacy best,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 334
			-
				-
					What order, so contrived as not to mix
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 335
			-
				-
					Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 336
			-
				-
					Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 337
			-
				-
					Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 338
			-
				-
					Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 339
			-
				-
					In India East or West, or middle shore
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 340
			-
				-
					In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 341
			-
				-
					Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 342
			-
				-
					Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 343
			-
				-
					She gathers, tribute large, and on the board
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 344
			-
				-
					Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 345
			-
				-
					She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths
				-

				Book 5: Line 378
			-
				-
					They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 379
			-
				-
					With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,

				Book 5: Line 380

				Book 5: Line 394

					All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 400

				Book 5: Line 401
			-

					The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps

				Book 5: Line 402
			-

					To spiritual natures; only this I know,

			-
				Book 5: Line 403

				Book 5: Line 418

					Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;

				Book 5: Line 420

				Book 5: Line 422
			-
				-
					From her moist continent to higher orbs.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 423
			-

			-
				Book 5: Line 424
			-
				-
					From all his alimental recompence
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 425
			-
				-
					In humid exhalations, and at even

				-
					Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 427
			-
				-
					Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 428
			-
				-
					Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 429
			-

				Book 5: Line 430

				Book 5: Line 431

				Book 5: Line 432
			-
				-
					As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 433
			-
				-
					Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,

			-
				Book 5: Line 434
			-
				-
					And to their viands fell; nor seemingly

			-
				Book 5: Line 435
			-
				-
					The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 436
			-
				-
					Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 437
			-
				-
					Of real hunger, and concoctive heat

				Book 5: Line 439

				Book 5: Line 440
			-
				-
					Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 441
			-

					Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,

				Book 5: Line 442
			-
				-
					Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 443
			-
				-
					As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 444
			-
				-
					Ministered naked, and their flowing cups
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 445
			-
				-
					With pleasant liquours crowned: O innocence
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 446
			-
				-
					Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 447
			-
				-
					Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 448
			-
				-
					Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 449
			-
				-
					Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 450
			-
				-
					Was understood, the injured lover's hell.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 451
			-
				-
					Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 452
			-
				-
					Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 453
			-
				-
					In Adam, not to let the occasion pass
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 454
			-
				-
					Given him by this great conference to know
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 455
			-
				-
					Of things above his world, and of their being
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 456
			-
				-
					Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 457
			-
				-
					Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 458
			-
				-
					Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 459
			-
				-
					Exceeded human; and his wary speech
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 460
			-
				-
					Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 461
			-
				-
					Inhabitant with God, now know I well
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 462
			-
				-
					Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 463
			-
				-
					Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 464
			-
				-
					To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 465
			-
				-
					Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 466
			-
				-
					As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 467
			-
				-
					At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 468
			-
				-
					To whom the winged Hierarch replied.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 469
			-
				-
					O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 470
			-
				-
					All things proceed, and up to him return,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 471
			-
				-
					If not depraved from good, created all
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 472
			-
				-
					Such to perfection, one first matter all,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 473
			-
				-
					Endued with various forms, various degrees
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 474
			-
				-
					Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 475
			-
				-
					But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 476
			-
				-
					As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 477
			-
				-
					Each in their several active spheres assigned,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 478
			-
				-
					Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 479
			-
				-
					Proportioned to each kind. So from the root
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 480
			-
				-
					Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 481
			-
				-
					More aery, last the bright consummate flower
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 482
			-
				-
					Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 483
			-
				-
					Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 484
			-
				-
					To vital spirits aspire, to animal,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 485
			-
				-
					To intellectual; give both life and sense,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 486
			-
				-
					Fancy and understanding; whence the soul
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 487
			-
				-
					Reason receives, and reason is her being,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 488
			-
				-
					Discursive, or intuitive; discourse
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 489
			-
				-
					Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 490
			-
				-
					Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 491
			-
				-
					Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 492
			-
				-
					If I refuse not, but convert, as you
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 493
			-
				-
					To proper substance. Time may come, when Men
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 494
			-
				-
					With Angels may participate, and find
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 495
			-
				-
					No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 496
			-
				-
					And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 497
			-
				-
					Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 498
			-
				-
					Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 499
			-
				-
					Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 500
			-
				-
					Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 501
			-
				-
					If ye be found obedient, and retain

			-
				Book 5: Line 502
			-
				-
					Unalterably firm his love entire,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 503
			-
				-
					Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 504
			-
				-
					Your fill what happiness this happy state
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 505
			-
				-
					Can comprehend, incapable of more.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 506
			-
				-
					To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 507
			-
				-
					O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 508
			-
				-
					Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 509
			-
				-
					Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 510
			-
				-
					From center to circumference; whereon,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 511
			-
				-
					In contemplation of created things,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 512
			-
				-
					By steps we may ascend to God. But say,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 513
			-
				-
					What meant that caution joined, If ye be found
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 514
			-
				-
					Obedient? Can we want obedience then
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 515
			-
				-
					To him, or possibly his love desert,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 516
			-
				-
					Who formed us from the dust and placed us here
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 517
			-
				-
					Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 518
			-
				-
					Human desires can seek or apprehend?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 519
			-
				-
					To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 520
			-
				-
					Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 521
			-
				-
					That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 522
			-
				-
					That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 523
			-
				-
					This was that caution given thee; be advised.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 524
			-
				-
					God made thee perfect, not immutable;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 525
			-
				-
					And good he made thee, but to persevere
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 526
			-
				-
					He left it in thy power; ordained thy will
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 527
			-
				-
					By nature free, not over-ruled by fate
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 528
			-
				-
					Inextricable, or strict necessity:

			-
				Book 5: Line 529
			-
				-
					Our voluntary service he requires,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 530
			-
				-
					Not our necessitated; such with him
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 531
			-
				-
					Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 532
			-
				-
					Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 533
			-
				-
					Willing or no, who will but what they must
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 534
			-
				-
					By destiny, and can no other choose?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 535
			-
				-
					Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 536
			-
				-
					In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 537
			-
				-
					Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 538
			-
				-
					On other surety none: Freely we serve,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 539
			-
				-
					Because we freely love, as in our will
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 540
			-
				-
					To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 541
			-
				-
					And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 542
			-
				-
					And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 543
			-

					From what high state of bliss, into what woe!

				Book 5: Line 549
			-
				-
					To be both will and deed created free;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 550
			-
				-
					Yet that we never shall forget to love
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 551

					Our Maker, and obey him whose command

				Book 5: Line 552

				-
					Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts

				Book 5: Line 553
			-
				-
					Assured me, and still assure: Though what thou tellest

			-
				Book 5: Line 554
			-
				-
					Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 555

					But more desire to hear, if thou consent,

				Book 5: Line 556
			-
				-
					The full relation, which must needs be strange,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 557
			-
				-
					Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 558
			-
				-
					And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 559

					Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins

					His other half in the great zone of Heaven.

					Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,

				Book 5: Line 565
			-
				-
					To human sense the invisible exploits
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 566
			-
				-
					Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 567
			-
				-
					The ruin of so many glorious once
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 568

					The secrets of another world, perhaps

				Book 5: Line 570
			-

					Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good

					This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach

			-
				Book 5: Line 572
			-
				-
					Of human sense, I shall delineate so,

				Book 5: Line 573
			-
				-
					By likening spiritual to corporal forms,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 574
			-
				-
					As may express them best; though what if Earth
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 575
			-
				-
					Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 576
			-
				-
					Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?
				-

					As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild

				Book 5: Line 578
			-

					Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 579
			-
				-
					Upon her center poised; when on a day
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 580
			-
				-
					(For time, though in eternity, applied
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 581
			-
				-
					To motion, measures all things durable
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 582
			-
				-
					By present, past, and future,) on such day
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 583
			-
				-
					As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 584
			-
				-
					Of Angels by imperial summons called,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 585
			-
				-
					Innumerable before the Almighty's throne
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 586
			-
				-
					Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 587
			-
				-
					Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 588
			-
				-
					Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 589
			-
				-
					Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 590
			-
				-
					Stream in the air, and for distinction serve
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 591
			-
				-
					Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 592
			-
				-
					Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 593
			-
				-
					Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 594
			-
				-
					Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 595
			-
				-
					Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 596
			-
				-
					Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 597
			-
				-
					By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 598
			-
				-
					Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 599
			-
				-
					Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 600
			-
				-
					Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 601
			-
				-
					Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 602
			-
				-
					Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 603
			-
				-
					This day I have begot whom I declare
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 604
			-
				-
					My only Son, and on this holy hill
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 605
			-
				-
					Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 606
			-
				-
					At my right hand; your head I him appoint;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 607
			-
				-
					And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 608
			-
				-
					All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 609
			-
				-
					Under his great vice-gerent reign abide
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 610
			-
				-
					United, as one individual soul,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 611
			-
				-
					For ever happy: Him who disobeys,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 612
			-
				-
					Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 613
			-
				-
					Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 614
			-
				-
					Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 615
			-
				-
					Ordained without redemption, without end.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 616
			-
				-
					So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 617
			-
				-
					All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 618
			-
				-
					That day, as other solemn days, they spent
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 619
			-
				-
					In song and dance about the sacred hill;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 620
			-
				-
					Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 621
			-
				-
					Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 622
			-
				-
					Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 623
			-
				-
					Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 624
			-
				-
					Then most, when most irregular they seem;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 625
			-
				-
					And in their motions harmony divine
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 626
			-
				-
					So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 627
			-
				-
					Listens delighted. Evening now approached,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 628
			-
				-
					(For we have also our evening and our morn,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 629
			-
				-
					We ours for change delectable, not need;)
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 630
			-
				-
					Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 631
			-
				-
					Desirous; all in circles as they stood,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 632
			-
				-
					Tables are set, and on a sudden piled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 633
			-
				-
					With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 634
			-
				-
					In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 635
			-
				-
					Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 636
			-
				-
					On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 637
			-
				-
					They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 638
			-
				-
					Quaff immortality and joy, secure
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 639
			-
				-
					Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 640
			-
				-
					Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 641
			-
				-
					With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 642
			-
				-
					Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 643
			-
				-
					From that high mount of God, whence light and shade
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 644
			-
				-
					Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 645
			-
				-
					To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 646
			-
				-
					In darker veil) and roseate dews disposed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 647
			-
				-
					All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 648
			-
				-
					Wide over all the plain, and wider far
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 649
			-
				-
					Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 650
			-
				-
					(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 651
			-
				-
					Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 652
			-
				-
					By living streams among the trees of life,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 653
			-
				-
					Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 654
			-
				-
					Celestial tabernacles, where they slept
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 655
			-
				-
					Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 656
			-
				-
					Melodious hymns about the sovran throne
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 657
			-
				-
					Alternate all night long: but not so waked
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 658
			-
				-
					Satan; so call him now, his former name
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 659
			-
				-
					Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 660
			-
				-
					If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 661
			-
				-
					In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 662
			-
				-
					With envy against the Son of God, that day
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 663
			-
				-
					Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 664
			-
				-
					Messiah King anointed, could not bear
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 665
			-
				-
					Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 666
			-
				-
					Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 667
			-
				-
					Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 668
			-
				-
					Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 669
			-
				-
					With all his legions to dislodge, and leave
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 670
			-
				-
					Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 671
			-
				-
					Contemptuous; and his next subordinate
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 672
			-
				-
					Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 673
			-
				-
					Sleepest thou, Companion dear? What sleep can close
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 674
			-
				-
					Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 675
			-
				-
					Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 676
			-
				-
					Of Heaven's Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 677
			-
				-
					Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 678
			-
				-
					Both waking we were one; how then can now
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 679
			-
				-
					Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 680
			-
				-
					New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 681
			-
				-
					In us who serve, new counsels to debate
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 682
			-
				-
					What doubtful may ensue: More in this place
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 683
			-
				-
					To utter is not safe. Assemble thou
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 684
			-
				-
					Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 685
			-
				-
					Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 686
			-
				-
					Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 687
			-
				-
					And all who under me their banners wave,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 688
			-
				-
					Homeward, with flying march, where we possess
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 689
			-
				-
					The quarters of the north; there to prepare
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 690
			-
				-
					Fit entertainment to receive our King,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 691
			-
				-
					The great Messiah, and his new commands,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 692
			-
				-
					Who speedily through all the hierarchies
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 693
			-
				-
					Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 694
			-
				-
					So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 695
			-
				-
					Bad influence into the unwary breast
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 696
			-
				-
					Of his associate: He together calls,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 697
			-
				-
					Or several one by one, the regent Powers,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 698
			-
				-
					Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 699
			-
				-
					That the Most High commanding, now ere night,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 700
			-
				-
					Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 701
			-
				-
					The great hierarchal standard was to move;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 702
			-
				-
					Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 703
			-
				-
					Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 704
			-
				-
					Or taint integrity: But all obeyed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 705
			-
				-
					The wonted signal, and superiour voice
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 706
			-
				-
					Of their great Potentate; for great indeed
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 707
			-
				-
					His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 708
			-
				-
					His countenance, as the morning-star that guides
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 709
			-
				-
					The starry flock, allured them, and with lies
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 710
			-
				-
					Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 711
			-
				-
					Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 712
			-
				-
					Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 713
			-
				-
					And from within the golden lamps that burn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 714
			-
				-
					Nightly before him, saw without their light
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 715
			-
				-
					Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 716
			-
				-
					Among the sons of morn, what multitudes
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 717
			-
				-
					Were banded to oppose his high decree;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 718
			-
				-
					And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 719
			-
				-
					Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 720
			-
				-
					In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 721
			-
				-
					Nearly it now concerns us to be sure
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 722
			-
				-
					Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 723
			-
				-
					We mean to hold what anciently we claim
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 724
			-
				-
					Of deity or empire: Such a foe
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 725
			-
				-
					Is rising, who intends to erect his throne
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 726
			-
				-
					Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 727
			-
				-
					Nor so content, hath in his thought to try
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 728
			-
				-
					In battle, what our power is, or our right.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 729
			-
				-
					Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 730
			-
				-
					With speed what force is left, and all employ
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 731
			-
				-
					In our defence; lest unawares we lose
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 732
			-
				-
					This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 733
			-
				-
					To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 734
			-
				-
					Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 735
			-
				-
					Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 736
			-
				-
					Justly hast in derision, and, secure,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 737
			-
				-
					Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 738
			-
				-
					Matter to me of glory, whom their hate
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 739
			-
				-
					Illustrates, when they see all regal power
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 740
			-
				-
					Given me to quell their pride, and in event
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 741
			-
				-
					Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 742
			-
				-
					Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 743
			-
				-
					So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 744
			-
				-
					Far was advanced on winged speed; an host
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 745
			-
				-
					Innumerable as the stars of night,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 746
			-
				-
					Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 747
			-
				-
					Impearls on every leaf and every flower.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 748
			-
				-

				Book 5: Line 751
			-
				-
					All thy dominion, Adam, is no more
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 752
			-

					Than what this garden is to all the earth,

				Book 5: Line 753

					And all the sea, from one entire globose

					Stretched into longitude; which having passed,

				Book 5: Line 755
			-

					At length into the limits of the north

			-
				Book 5: Line 757
			-
				-
					High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 758
			-
				-
					Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 759
			-

				Book 5: Line 760

					The palace of great Lucifer, (so call

				Book 5: Line 761
			-
				-
					That structure in the dialect of men
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 762

					In imitation of that mount whereon

				Book 5: Line 768
			-

					Pretending so commanded to consult

				Book 5: Line 769
			-
				-
					About the great reception of their King,
				-

				Book 5: Line 770
			-

					Thither to come, and with calumnious art

			-
				Book 5: Line 771
			-

					Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.

			-

				Book 5: Line 776
			-

				Book 5: Line 777
			-
				-
					Of King anointed, for whom all this haste

			-
				Book 5: Line 778
			-
				-
					Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 779
			-
				-
					This only to consult how we may best,

			-
				Book 5: Line 780
			-
				-
					With what may be devised of honours new,

			-
				Book 5: Line 781
			-

					Receive him coming to receive from us

				Book 5: Line 782
			-
				-
					Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 783
			-
				-
					Too much to one! but double how endured,

			-
				Book 5: Line 784
			-
				-
					To one, and to his image now proclaimed?

			-
				Book 5: Line 785

					But what if better counsels might erect

			-
				Book 5: Line 786
			-
				-
					Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 787
			-
				-
					Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 788
			-
				-
					The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 789
			-
				-
					To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 790
			-
				-
					Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 791
			-
				-
					By none; and if not equal all, yet free,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 792
			-
				-
					Equally free; for orders and degrees
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 793
			-
				-
					Jar not with liberty, but well consist.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 794

				-
					Who can in reason then, or right, assume

			-
				Book 5: Line 795
			-
				-
					Monarchy over such as live by right
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 796
			-
				-
					His equals, if in power and splendour less,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 797
			-
				-
					In freedom equal? or can introduce
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 798
			-
				-
					Law and edict on us, who without law
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 799
			-
				-
					Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 800
			-
				-
					And look for adoration, to the abuse
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 801
			-
				-
					Of those imperial titles, which assert
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 802
			-
				-
					Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 803
			-
				-
					Thus far his bold discourse without controul
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 804
			-
				-
					Had audience; when among the Seraphim
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 805
			-
				-
					Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 806
			-
				-
					The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 807
			-
				-
					Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 808
			-
				-
					The current of his fury thus opposed.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 809
			-
				-
					O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 810
			-
				-
					Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 811
			-
				-
					Expected, least of all from thee, Ingrate,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 812
			-
				-
					In place thyself so high above thy peers.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 813
			-
				-
					Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 814
			-
				-
					The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 815
			-
				-
					That to his only Son, by right endued
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 816
			-
				-
					With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 817
			-
				-
					Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 818
			-
				-
					Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 819
			-
				-
					Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 820
			-
				-
					And equal over equals to let reign,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 821
			-
				-
					One over all with unsucceeded power.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 822
			-
				-
					Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 823
			-
				-
					With him the points of liberty, who made
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 824
			-
				-
					Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 825
			-
				-
					Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 826
			-
				-
					Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 827
			-
				-
					And of our good and of our dignity
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 828
			-
				-
					How provident he is; how far from thought
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 829
			-
				-
					To make us less, bent rather to exalt
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 830
			-
				-
					Our happy state, under one head more near
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 831
			-
				-
					United. But to grant it thee unjust,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 832
			-
				-
					That equal over equals monarch reign:
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 833
			-
				-
					Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 834
			-
				-
					Or all angelick nature joined in one,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 835
			-
				-
					Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 836
			-
				-
					As by his Word, the Mighty Father made
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 837
			-
				-
					All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 838
			-
				-
					By him created in their bright degrees,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 839
			-
				-
					Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 840
			-
				-
					Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 841
			-
				-
					Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 842
			-
				-
					But more illustrious made; since he the head
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 843
			-
				-
					One of our number thus reduced becomes;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 844
			-
				-
					His laws our laws; all honour to him done
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 845
			-
				-
					Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 846
			-
				-
					And tempt not these; but hasten to appease
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 847
			-
				-
					The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 848
			-
				-
					While pardon may be found in time besought.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 849
			-
				-
					So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 850
			-
				-
					None seconded, as out of season judged,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 851
			-
				-
					Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 852
			-
				-
					The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 853
			-
				-
					That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 854
			-
				-
					Of secondary hands, by task transferred
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 855
			-
				-
					From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 856
			-
				-
					Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 857
			-
				-
					When this creation was? rememberest thou
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 858
			-
				-
					Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 859
			-
				-
					We know no time when we were not as now;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 860
			-
				-
					Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 861
			-
				-
					By our own quickening power, when fatal course
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 862
			-
				-
					Had circled his full orb, the birth mature
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 863
			-
				-
					Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 864
			-
				-
					Our puissance is our own; our own right hand
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 865
			-
				-
					Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 866
			-
				-
					Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 867
			-
				-
					Whether by supplication we intend
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 868
			-
				-
					Address, and to begirt the almighty throne
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 869
			-
				-
					Beseeching or besieging. This report,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 870
			-
				-
					These tidings carry to the anointed King;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 871
			-
				-
					And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 872
			-
				-
					He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 873
			-
				-
					Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 874
			-
				-
					Through the infinite host; nor less for that
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 875
			-
				-
					The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 876
			-
				-
					Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 877
			-
				-
					O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 878
			-
				-
					Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 879
			-
				-
					Determined, and thy hapless crew involved
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 880
			-
				-
					In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 881
			-
				-
					Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 882
			-
				-
					No more be troubled how to quit the yoke
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 883
			-
				-
					Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 884
			-
				-
					Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 885
			-
				-
					Against thee are gone forth without recall;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 886
			-
				-
					That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 887
			-
				-
					Is now an iron rod to bruise and break
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 888
			-
				-
					Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 889
			-
				-
					Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 890
			-
				-
					These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 891
			-
				-
					Impendent, raging into sudden flame,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 892
			-
				-
					Distinguish not: For soon expect to feel
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 893
			-
				-
					His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 894
			-
				-
					Then who created thee lamenting learn,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 895
			-
				-
					When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 896
			-
				-
					So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 897
			-
				-
					Among the faithless, faithful only he;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 898
			-
				-
					Among innumerable false, unmoved,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 899
			-
				-
					Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 900
			-
				-
					His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 901
			-
				-
					Nor number, nor example, with him wrought
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 902
			-
				-
					To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 903
			-
				-
					Though single. From amidst them forth he passed,
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 904
			-
				-
					Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 905
			-
				-
					Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 906
			-
				-
					And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned
				-
			-
				Book 5: Line 907
			-
				-
					On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.

			Book 6

				Book 6: Line 1
			-
				-
					All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 2
			-
				-
					Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 3
			-
				-
					Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 4
			-
				-
					Unbarred the gates of light. There is a cave
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 5
			-
				-
					Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 6
			-
				-
					Where light and darkness in perpetual round
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 7
			-
				-
					Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 8
			-
				-
					Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 9
			-
				-
					Light issues forth, and at the other door
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 10
			-
				-
					Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 11
			-
				-
					To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 12
			-
				-
					Seem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 13
			-
				-
					Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 14
			-
				-
					Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 15
			-
				-
					Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 16
			-
				-
					Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 17
			-
				-
					Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 18
			-
				-
					Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 19
			-
				-
					War he perceived, war in procinct; and found
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 20
			-
				-
					Already known what he for news had thought
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 21
			-
				-
					To have reported: Gladly then he mixed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 22
			-
				-
					Among those friendly Powers, who him received
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 23
			-
				-
					With joy and acclamations loud, that one,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 24
			-
				-
					That of so many myriads fallen, yet one
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 25
			-
				-
					Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 26
			-
				-
					They led him high applauded, and present
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 27
			-
				-
					Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 28
			-
				-
					From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 29
			-
				-
					Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 30
			-
				-
					The better fight, who single hast maintained
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 31
			-
				-
					Against revolted multitudes the cause
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 32
			-
				-
					Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 33
			-
				-
					And for the testimony of truth hast borne
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 34
			-
				-
					Universal reproach, far worse to bear
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 35
			-
				-
					Than violence; for this was all thy care
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 36
			-
				-
					To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 37
			-
				-
					Judged thee perverse: The easier conquest now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 38
			-
				-
					Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 39
			-
				-
					Back on thy foes more glorious to return,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 40
			-
				-
					Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 41
			-
				-
					By force, who reason for their law refuse,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 42
			-
				-
					Right reason for their law, and for their King
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 43
			-
				-
					Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 44

					And thou, in military prowess next,
				-

				Book 6: Line 46
			-
				-
					Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 47
			-
				-
					Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 48
			-
				-
					By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 49
			-
				-
					Equal in number to that Godless crew
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 50
			-
				-
					Rebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 51
			-
				-
					Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 52
			-
				-
					Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 53
			-
				-
					Into their place of punishment, the gulf
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 54
			-
				-
					Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 55
			-
				-
					His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 56
			-
				-
					So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 57
			-
				-
					To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 58
			-
				-
					In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 59
			-
				-
					Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 60
			-
				-
					Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 61
			-
				-
					At which command the Powers militant,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 62
			-
				-
					That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 63
			-
				-
					Of union irresistible, moved on
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 64
			-
				-
					In silence their bright legions, to the sound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 65
			-
				-
					Of instrumental harmony, that breathed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 66
			-
				-
					Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 67
			-
				-
					Under their God-like leaders, in the cause
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 68
			-
				-
					Of God and his Messiah. On they move
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 69
			-
				-
					Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 70
			-
				-
					Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 71
			-
				-
					Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 72
			-
				-
					Their march was, and the passive air upbore
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 73
			-
				-
					Their nimble tread; as when the total kind
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 74
			-
				-
					Of birds, in orderly array on wing,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 75
			-
				-
					Came summoned over Eden to receive
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 76
			-
				-
					Their names of thee; so over many a tract
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 77
			-
				-
					Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 78
			-
				-
					Tenfold the length of this terrene: At last,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 79
			-
				-
					Far in the horizon to the north appeared
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 80
			-
				-
					From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 81
			-
				-
					In battailous aspect, and nearer view
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 82
			-
				-
					Bristled with upright beams innumerable
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 83
			-
				-
					Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 84
			-
				-
					Various, with boastful argument portrayed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 85
			-
				-
					The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 86
			-
				-
					With furious expedition; for they weened
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 87
			-
				-
					That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 88
			-
				-
					To win the mount of God, and on his throne
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 89
			-
				-
					To set the Envier of his state, the proud
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 90
			-
				-
					Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 91
			-
				-
					In the mid way: Though strange to us it seemed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 92
			-
				-
					At first, that Angel should with Angel war,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 93
			-
				-
					And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 94
			-
				-
					So oft in festivals of joy and love
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 95
			-
				-
					Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 96
			-
				-
					Hymning the Eternal Father: But the shout
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 97
			-
				-
					Of battle now began, and rushing sound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 98
			-
				-
					Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 99
			-
				-
					High in the midst, exalted as a God,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 100
			-
				-
					The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 101
			-
				-
					Idol of majesty divine, enclosed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 102
			-
				-
					With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 103
			-
				-
					Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 104
			-
				-
					'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 105
			-
				-
					A dreadful interval, and front to front
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 106
			-
				-
					Presented stood in terrible array
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 107
			-
				-
					Of hideous length: Before the cloudy van,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 108
			-
				-
					On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 109
			-
				-
					Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 110
			-
				-
					Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 111
			-
				-
					Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 112
			-
				-
					Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 113
			-
				-
					And thus his own undaunted heart explores.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 114
			-
				-
					O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 115
			-
				-
					Should yet remain, where faith and realty
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 116
			-
				-
					Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 117
			-
				-
					There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 118
			-
				-
					Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 119
			-
				-
					His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 120
			-
				-
					I mean to try, whose reason I have tried
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 121
			-
				-
					Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 122
			-
				-
					That he, who in debate of truth hath won,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 123
			-
				-
					Should win in arms, in both disputes alike
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 124
			-
				-
					Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 125
			-
				-
					When reason hath to deal with force, yet so
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 126
			-
				-
					Most reason is that reason overcome.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 127
			-
				-
					So pondering, and from his armed peers
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 128
			-
				-
					Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 129
			-
				-
					His daring foe, at this prevention more
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 130
			-
				-
					Incensed, and thus securely him defied.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 131
			-
				-
					Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 132
			-
				-
					The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 133
			-
				-
					The throne of God unguarded, and his side
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 134
			-
				-
					Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 135
			-
				-
					Or potent tongue: Fool! not to think how vain
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 136
			-
				-
					Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 137
			-
				-
					Who out of smallest things could, without end,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 138
			-
				-
					Have raised incessant armies to defeat
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 139
			-
				-
					Thy folly; or with solitary hand
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 140
			-
				-
					Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 141
			-
				-
					Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 142
			-
				-
					Thy legions under darkness: But thou seest
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 143
			-
				-
					All are not of thy train; there be, who faith
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 144
			-
				-
					Prefer, and piety to God, though then
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 145
			-
				-
					To thee not visible, when I alone
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 146
			-
				-
					Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 147
			-
				-
					From all: My sect thou seest; now learn too late
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 148
			-
				-
					How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 149
			-
				-
					Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 150
			-
				-
					Thus answered. Ill for thee, but in wished hour
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 151
			-
				-
					Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 152
			-
				-
					From flight, seditious Angel! to receive
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 153
			-
				-
					Thy merited reward, the first assay
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 154
			-
				-
					Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 155
			-
				-
					Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 156
			-
				-
					A third part of the Gods, in synod met
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 157
			-
				-
					Their deities to assert; who, while they feel
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 158
			-
				-
					Vigour divine within them, can allow
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 159
			-
				-
					Omnipotence to none. But well thou comest
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 160
			-
				-
					Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 161
			-
				-
					From me some plume, that thy success may show
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 162
			-
				-
					Destruction to the rest: This pause between,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 163
			-
				-
					(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 164
			-
				-
					At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 165
			-
				-
					To heavenly souls had been all one; but now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 166
			-
				-
					I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 167
			-
				-
					Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 168
			-
				-
					Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 169
			-
				-
					Servility with freedom to contend,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 170
			-
				-
					As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 171
			-
				-
					To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 172
			-
				-
					Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 173
			-
				-
					Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 174
			-
				-
					Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 175
			-
				-
					Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 176
			-
				-
					Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 177
			-
				-
					When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 178
			-
				-
					Them whom he governs. This is servitude,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 179
			-
				-
					To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 180
			-
				-
					Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 181
			-
				-
					Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 182
			-
				-
					Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 183
			-
				-
					Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 184
			-
				-
					In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 185
			-
				-
					Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 186
			-
				-
					Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: Mean while
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 187
			-
				-
					From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 188
			-
				-
					This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 189
			-
				-
					So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 190
			-
				-
					Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 191
			-
				-
					On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 192
			-
				-
					Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 193
			-
				-
					Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 194
			-
				-
					He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 195
			-
				-
					His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 196
			-
				-
					Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 197
			-
				-
					Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 198
			-
				-
					Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seised
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 199
			-
				-
					The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 200
			-
				-
					Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 201
			-
				-
					Presage of victory, and fierce desire
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 202
			-
				-
					Of battle: Whereat Michael bid sound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 203
			-
				-
					The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 204
			-
				-
					It sounded, and the faithful armies rung
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 205
			-
				-
					Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 206
			-
				-
					The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 207
			-
				-
					The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 208
			-
				-
					And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 209
			-
				-
					Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 210
			-
				-
					Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 211
			-
				-
					Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 212
			-
				-
					Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 213
			-
				-
					Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 214
			-
				-
					And flying vaulted either host with fire.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 215
			-
				-
					So under fiery cope together rushed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 216
			-
				-
					Both battles main, with ruinous assault
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 217
			-
				-
					And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 218
			-
				-
					Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 219
			-
				-
					Had to her center shook. What wonder? when
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 220
			-
				-
					Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 221
			-
				-
					On either side, the least of whom could wield
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 222
			-
				-
					These elements, and arm him with the force
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 223
			-
				-
					Of all their regions: How much more of power
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 224
			-
				-
					Army against army numberless to raise
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 225
			-
				-
					Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 226
			-
				-
					Though not destroy, their happy native seat;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 227
			-
				-
					Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 228
			-
				-
					From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 229
			-
				-
					And limited their might; though numbered such
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 230
			-
				-
					As each divided legion might have seemed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 231
			-
				-
					A numerous host; in strength each armed hand
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 232
			-
				-
					A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 233
			-
				-
					Each warriour single as in chief, expert
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 234
			-
				-
					When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 235
			-
				-
					Of battle, open when, and when to close
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 236
			-
				-
					The ridges of grim war: No thought of flight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 237
			-
				-
					None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 238
			-
				-
					That argued fear; each on himself relied,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 239
			-
				-
					As only in his arm the moment lay
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 240
			-
				-
					Of victory: Deeds of eternal fame
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 241
			-
				-
					Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 242
			-
				-
					That war and various; sometimes on firm ground
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 243
			-
				-
					A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 244
			-
				-
					Tormented all the air; all air seemed then
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 245
			-
				-
					Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 246
			-
				-
					The battle hung; till Satan, who that day
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 247
			-
				-
					Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms
				-
			-

					Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest

				Book 6: Line 305

					Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields

				Book 6: Line 306

			-
				Book 6: Line 310

			-
				Book 6: Line 312

				Book 6: Line 314
			-
				-
					Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 315
			-

					Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.

				Book 6: Line 316
			-
				-
					Together both with next to almighty arm
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 317
			-
				-
					Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 318
			-
				-
					That might determine, and not need repeat,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 319
			-
				-
					As not of power at once; nor odds appeared
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 320
			-
				-
					In might or swift prevention: But the sword
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 321
			-
				-
					Of Michael from the armoury of God
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 322
			-
				-
					Was given him tempered so, that neither keen
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 323
			-
				-
					Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 324
			-
				-
					The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 325
			-
				-
					Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 326
			-
				-
					But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 327
			-
				-
					All his right side: Then Satan first knew pain,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 328
			-
				-
					And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 329
			-
				-
					The griding sword with discontinuous wound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 330
			-
				-
					Passed through him: But the ethereal substance closed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 331
			-
				-
					Not long divisible; and from the gash
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 332
			-
				-
					A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 333
			-
				-
					Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 334
			-
				-
					And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 335
			-
				-
					Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 336
			-
				-
					By Angels many and strong, who interposed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 337
			-
				-
					Defence, while others bore him on their shields
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 338
			-
				-
					Back to his chariot, where it stood retired
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 339
			-
				-
					From off the files of war: There they him laid
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 340
			-
				-
					Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 341
			-
				-
					To find himself not matchless, and his pride
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 342
			-
				-
					Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 343
			-
				-
					His confidence to equal God in power.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 344
			-
				-
					Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 345
			-
				-
					Vital in every part, not as frail man
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 346
			-
				-
					In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 347
			-
				-
					Cannot but by annihilating die;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 348
			-
				-
					Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 349
			-
				-
					Receive, no more than can the fluid air:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 350
			-
				-
					All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 351
			-
				-
					All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 352
			-
				-
					They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 353
			-
				-
					Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 354
			-
				-
					Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 355
			-
				-
					Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 356
			-
				-
					And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 357
			-
				-
					Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 358
			-
				-
					And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 359
			-
				-
					Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 360
			-
				-
					Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 361
			-
				-
					Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 362
			-
				-
					And uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 363
			-
				-
					Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 364
			-
				-
					Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 365
			-
				-
					Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 366
			-
				-
					Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 367
			-
				-
					Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 368
			-
				-
					Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 369
			-
				-
					Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 370
			-
				-
					The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 371
			-
				-
					Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 372
			-
				-
					Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 373
			-
				-
					I might relate of thousands, and their names
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 374
			-
				-
					Eternize here on earth; but those elect
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 375
			-
				-
					Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 376
			-
				-
					Seek not the praise of men: The other sort,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 377
			-
				-
					In might though wonderous and in acts of war,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 378
			-
				-
					Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 379
			-
				-
					Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 380
			-
				-
					Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 381
			-
				-
					For strength from truth divided, and from just,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 382
			-
				-
					Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 383
			-
				-
					And ignominy; yet to glory aspires
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 384
			-
				-
					Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 385
			-
				-
					Therefore eternal silence be their doom.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 386
			-
				-
					And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 387
			-
				-
					With many an inroad gored; deformed rout
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 388
			-
				-
					Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 389
			-
				-
					With shivered armour strown, and on a heap
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 390
			-
				-
					Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 391
			-
				-
					And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 392
			-
				-
					O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 393
			-
				-
					Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 394
			-
				-
					Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 395
			-
				-
					Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 396
			-
				-
					By sin of disobedience; till that hour
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 397
			-
				-
					Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 398
			-
				-
					Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 399
			-
				-
					In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 400
			-
				-
					Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 401
			-
				-
					Such high advantages their innocence
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 402
			-
				-
					Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 403
			-
				-
					Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 404
			-
				-
					Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 405
			-
				-
					By wound, though from their place by violence moved,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 406
			-
				-
					Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 407
			-
				-
					Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 408
			-
				-
					And silence on the odious din of war:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 409
			-
				-
					Under her cloudy covert both retired,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 410
			-
				-
					Victor and vanquished: On the foughten field
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 411
			-
				-
					Michael and his Angels prevalent
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 412
			-
				-
					Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 413
			-
				-
					Cherubick waving fires: On the other part,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 414
			-
				-
					Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 415
			-
				-
					Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 416
			-
				-
					His potentates to council called by night;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 417
			-
				-
					And in the midst thus undismayed began.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 418
			-
				-
					O now in danger tried, now known in arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 419
			-
				-
					Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 420
			-
				-
					Found worthy not of liberty alone,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 421
			-
				-
					Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 422
			-
				-
					Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 423
			-
				-
					Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 424
			-
				-
					(And if one day, why not eternal days?)
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 425
			-
				-
					What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 426
			-
				-
					Against us from about his throne, and judged
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 427
			-
				-
					Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 428
			-
				-
					But proves not so: Then fallible, it seems,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 429
			-
				-
					Of future we may deem him, though till now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 430
			-
				-
					Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 431
			-
				-
					Some disadvantage we endured and pain,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 432
			-
				-
					Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 433
			-
				-
					Since now we find this our empyreal form
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 434
			-
				-
					Incapable of mortal injury,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 435
			-
				-
					Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 436
			-
				-
					Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 437
			-
				-
					Of evil then so small as easy think
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 438
			-
				-
					The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 439
			-
				-
					Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 440
			-
				-
					May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 441
			-
				-
					Or equal what between us made the odds,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 442
			-
				-
					In nature none: If other hidden cause
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 443

					Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 445

				Book 6: Line 447
			-
				-
					Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;

			-
				Book 6: Line 448

					For Gods, and too unequal work we find,

				Book 6: Line 454
			-

					Against unequal arms to fight in pain,

			-
				-
					These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
				-

				Book 6: Line 478
			-

					Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
				-

				Book 6: Line 479

				Book 6: Line 481

					These in their dark nativity the deep

				Book 6: Line 490

					Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed

				Book 6: Line 491

					Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,

					The invention all admired, and each, how he

					In future days, if malice should abound,

				Book 6: Line 505
			-

					Like instrument to plague the sons of men

				Book 6: Line 506
			-

					For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 507
			-
				-
					Forthwith from council to the work they flew;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 508
			-
				-
					None arguing stood; innumerable hands
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 509
			-
				-
					Were ready; in a moment up they turned
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 510
			-
				-
					Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 511
			-
				-
					The originals of nature in their crude
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 512
			-
				-
					Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 513
			-
				-
					They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 514
			-
				-
					Concocted and adusted they reduced
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 515
			-
				-
					To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 516
			-
				-
					Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 517
			-
				-
					Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 518
			-
				-
					Whereof to found their engines and their balls
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 519
			-
				-
					Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 520
			-
				-
					Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 521
			-
				-
					So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 522
			-
				-
					Secret they finished, and in order set,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 523
			-
				-
					With silent circumspection, unespied.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 524
			-
				-
					Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 525
			-
				-
					Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 526
			-
				-
					The matin trumpet sung: In arms they stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 527
			-
				-
					Of golden panoply, refulgent host,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 528
			-
				-
					Soon banded; others from the dawning hills
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 529
			-
				-
					Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 530
			-
				-
					Each quarter to descry the distant foe,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 531
			-
				-
					Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 532
			-
				-
					In motion or in halt: Him soon they met
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 533
			-
				-
					Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 534
			-
				-
					But firm battalion; back with speediest sail
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 535
			-
				-
					Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 536
			-
				-
					Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 537
			-
				-
					Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 538
			-
				-
					Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 539
			-
				-
					This day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 540
			-
				-
					He comes, and settled in his face I see
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 541
			-
				-
					Sad resolution, and secure: Let each
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 542
			-
				-
					His adamantine coat gird well, and each
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 543
			-
				-
					Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 544
			-
				-
					Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 545
			-
				-
					If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 546
			-
				-
					But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 547
			-
				-
					So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 548
			-
				-
					In order, quit of all impediment;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 549
			-
				-
					Instant without disturb they took alarm,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 550
			-
				-
					And onward moved embattled: When behold!
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 551
			-
				-
					Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 552
			-
				-
					Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 553
			-
				-
					Training his devilish enginery, impaled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 554
			-
				-
					On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 555
			-
				-
					To hide the fraud. At interview both stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 556
			-
				-
					A while; but suddenly at head appeared
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 557
			-
				-
					Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 558
			-
				-
					Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 559
			-
				-
					That all may see who hate us, how we seek
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 560
			-
				-
					Peace and composure, and with open breast
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 561
			-
				-
					Stand ready to receive them, if they like
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 562
			-
				-
					Our overture; and turn not back perverse:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 563
			-
				-
					But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 564
			-
				-
					Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 565
			-
				-
					Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 566
			-
				-
					Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 567
			-
				-
					What we propound, and loud that all may hear!
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 568
			-
				-
					So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 569
			-
				-
					Had ended; when to right and left the front
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 570
			-
				-
					Divided, and to either flank retired:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 571
			-
				-
					Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 572
			-
				-
					A triple mounted row of pillars laid
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 573
			-
				-
					On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 574
			-
				-
					Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 575
			-
				-
					With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 576
			-
				-
					Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 577
			-
				-
					With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 578
			-
				-
					Portending hollow truce: At each behind
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 579
			-
				-
					A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 580
			-
				-
					Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 581
			-
				-
					Collected stood within our thoughts amused,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 582
			-
				-
					Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 583
			-
				-
					Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 584
			-
				-
					With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 585
			-
				-
					But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 586
			-
				-
					From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 587
			-
				-
					Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 588
			-
				-
					And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 589
			-
				-
					Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 590
			-
				-
					Of iron globes; which, on the victor host
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 591
			-
				-
					Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 592
			-
				-
					That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 593
			-
				-
					Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 594
			-
				-
					By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 595
			-
				-
					The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 596
			-
				-
					Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 597
			-
				-
					By quick contraction or remove; but now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 598
			-
				-
					Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 599
			-
				-
					Nor served it to relax their serried files.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 600
			-
				-
					What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 601
			-
				-
					Repeated, and indecent overthrow
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 602
			-
				-
					Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 603
			-
				-
					And to their foes a laughter; for in view
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 604
			-
				-
					Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 605
			-
				-
					In posture to displode their second tire
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 606
			-
				-
					Of thunder: Back defeated to return
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 607
			-
				-
					They worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 608
			-
				-
					And to his mates thus in derision called.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 609
			-
				-
					O Friends! why come not on these victors proud
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 610
			-
				-
					Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 611
			-
				-
					To entertain them fair with open front
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 612
			-
				-
					And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 613
			-
				-
					Of composition, straight they changed their minds,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 614
			-
				-
					Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 615
			-
				-
					As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 616
			-
				-
					Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 617
			-
				-
					For joy of offered peace: But I suppose,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 618
			-
				-
					If our proposals once again were heard,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 619
			-
				-
					We should compel them to a quick result.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 620
			-
				-
					To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 621
			-
				-
					Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 622
			-
				-
					Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 623
			-
				-
					Such as we might perceive amused them all,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 624
			-
				-
					And stumbled many: Who receives them right,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 625
			-
				-
					Had need from head to foot well understand;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 626
			-
				-
					Not understood, this gift they have besides,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 627
			-
				-
					They show us when our foes walk not upright.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 628
			-
				-
					So they among themselves in pleasant vein
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 629
			-
				-
					Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 630
			-
				-
					All doubt of victory: Eternal Might
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 631
			-
				-
					To match with their inventions they presumed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 632
			-
				-
					So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 633
			-
				-
					And all his host derided, while they stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 634
			-
				-
					A while in trouble: But they stood not long;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 635
			-
				-
					Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 636
			-
				-
					Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 637
			-
				-
					Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 638
			-
				-
					Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 639
			-
				-
					Their arms away they threw, and to the hills
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 640
			-
				-
					(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 641
			-
				-
					Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 642
			-
				-
					Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 643
			-
				-
					From their foundations loosening to and fro,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 644
			-
				-
					They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 645
			-
				-
					Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 646
			-
				-
					Up-lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 647
			-
				-
					Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 648
			-
				-
					When coming towards them so dread they saw
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 649
			-
				-
					The bottom of the mountains upward turned;
				-
			-

					Till on those cursed engines' triple-row
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 651
			-
				-
					They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 652
			-
				-
					Under the weight of mountains buried deep;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 653
			-
				-
					Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 654
			-
				-
					Main promontories flung, which in the air
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 655
			-
				-
					Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 656
			-
				-
					Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 657
			-
				-
					Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 658
			-
				-
					Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 659
			-
				-
					Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 660
			-
				-
					Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 661
			-
				-
					Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 662
			-
				-
					The rest, in imitation, to like arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 663
			-
				-
					Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 664
			-
				-
					So hills amid the air encountered hills,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 665
			-
				-
					Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 666
			-
				-
					That under ground they fought in dismal shade;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 667
			-
				-
					Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 668
			-
				-
					To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 669
			-
				-
					Upon confusion rose: And now all Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 670
			-
				-
					Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 671
			-
				-
					Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 672
			-
				-
					Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 673
			-
				-
					Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 674
			-
				-
					This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 675
			-
				-
					That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 676
			-
				-
					To honour his anointed Son avenged
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 677
			-
				-
					Upon his enemies, and to declare
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 678
			-
				-
					All power on him transferred: Whence to his Son,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 679
			-
				-
					The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 680
			-
				-
					Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 681
			-
				-
					Son, in whose face invisible is beheld
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 682
			-
				-
					Visibly, what by Deity I am;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 683
			-
				-
					And in whose hand what by decree I do,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 684
			-
				-
					Second Omnipotence! two days are past,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 685
			-
				-
					Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 686
			-
				-
					Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 687
			-
				-
					These disobedient: Sore hath been their fight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 688
			-
				-
					As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 689
			-
				-
					For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 690
			-
				-
					Equal in their creation they were formed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 691
			-
				-
					Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 692
			-
				-
					Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 693
			-
				-
					Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 694
			-
				-
					Endless, and no solution will be found:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 695
			-
				-
					War wearied hath performed what war can do,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 696
			-
				-
					And to disordered rage let loose the reins
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 697
			-
				-
					With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 698
			-
				-
					Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 699
			-
				-
					Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 700
			-
				-
					For thee I have ordained it; and thus far
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 701
			-
				-
					Have suffered, that the glory may be thine
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 702
			-
				-
					Of ending this great war, since none but Thou
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 703
			-
				-
					Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 704
			-
				-
					Immense I have transfused, that all may know
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 705
			-
				-
					In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 706
			-
				-
					And, this perverse commotion governed thus,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 707
			-
				-
					To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 708
			-
				-
					Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 709
			-
				-
					By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 710
			-
				-
					Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 711
			-
				-
					Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 712
			-
				-
					That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 713
			-
				-
					My bow and thunder, my almighty arms
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 714
			-
				-
					Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 715
			-
				-
					Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 716
			-
				-
					From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 717
			-
				-
					There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 718
			-
				-
					God, and Messiah his anointed King.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 719
			-
				-
					He said, and on his Son with rays direct
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 720
			-
				-
					Shone full; he all his Father full expressed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 721
			-
				-
					Ineffably into his face received;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 722
			-
				-
					And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 723
			-
				-
					O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 724
			-
				-
					First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 725
			-
				-
					To glorify thy Son, I always thee,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 726
			-
				-
					As is most just: This I my glory account,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 727
			-
				-
					My exaltation, and my whole delight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 728
			-
				-
					That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 729
			-
				-
					Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 730
			-
				-
					Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 731
			-
				-
					And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 732
			-
				-
					Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 733
			-
				-
					For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 734
			-
				-
					But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 735
			-
				-
					Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 736
			-
				-
					Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 737
			-
				-
					Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 738
			-
				-
					To their prepared ill mansion driven down,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 739
			-
				-
					To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 740
			-
				-
					That from thy just obedience could revolt,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 741
			-
				-
					Whom to obey is happiness entire.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 742
			-
				-
					Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 743
			-
				-
					Far separate, circling thy holy mount,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 744
			-
				-
					Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 745
			-
				-
					Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 746
			-
				-
					So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 747
			-
				-
					From the right hand of Glory where he sat;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 748
			-
				-
					And the third sacred morn began to shine,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 749
			-
				-
					Dawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind sound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 750
			-
				-
					The chariot of Paternal Deity,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 751
			-
				-
					Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 752
			-
				-
					Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 753
			-
				-
					By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 754
			-
				-
					Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 755
			-
				-
					And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 756
			-
				-
					Of beryl, and careering fires between;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 757
			-
				-
					Over their heads a crystal firmament,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 758
			-
				-
					Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 759
			-
				-
					Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 760
			-
				-
					He, in celestial panoply all armed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 761
			-
				-
					Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 762
			-
				-
					Ascended; at his right hand Victory
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 763
			-
				-
					Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 764
			-
				-
					And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 765
			-
				-
					And from about him fierce effusion rolled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 766
			-
				-
					Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 767
			-
				-
					Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 768
			-
				-
					He onward came; far off his coming shone;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 769
			-
				-
					And twenty thousand (I their number heard)
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 770
			-
				-
					Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 771
			-
				-
					He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 772
			-
				-
					On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 773
			-
				-
					Illustrious far and wide; but by his own
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 774
			-
				-
					First seen: Them unexpected joy surprised,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 775
			-
				-
					When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 776
			-
				-
					Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 777
			-
				-
					Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 778
			-
				-
					His army, circumfused on either wing,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 779
			-
				-
					Under their Head imbodied all in one.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 780
			-
				-
					Before him Power Divine his way prepared;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 781
			-
				-
					At his command the uprooted hills retired
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 782
			-
				-
					Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 783
			-
				-
					Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 784
			-
				-
					And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 785
			-
				-
					This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 786
			-
				-
					And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 787
			-
				-
					Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 788
			-
				-
					In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 789
			-
				-
					But to convince the proud what signs avail,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 790
			-
				-
					Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 791
			-
				-
					They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 792
			-
				-
					Grieving to see his glory, at the sight
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 793
			-
				-
					Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 794
			-
				-
					Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 795
			-
				-
					Weening to prosper, and at length prevail
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 796
			-
				-
					Against God and Messiah, or to fall
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 797
			-
				-
					In universal ruin last; and now
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 798
			-
				-
					To final battle drew, disdaining flight,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 799
			-
				-
					Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 800
			-
				-
					To all his host on either hand thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 801
			-
				-
					Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 802
			-
				-
					Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 803
			-
				-
					Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 804
			-
				-
					Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 805
			-
				-
					And as ye have received, so have ye done,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 806
			-
				-
					Invincibly: But of this cursed crew
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 807
			-
				-
					The punishment to other hand belongs;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 808
			-
				-
					Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 809
			-
				-
					Number to this day's work is not ordained,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 810
			-
				-
					Nor multitude; stand only, and behold
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 811
			-
				-
					God's indignation on these godless poured
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 812
			-
				-
					By me; not you, but me, they have despised,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 813
			-
				-
					Yet envied; against me is all their rage,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 814
			-
				-
					Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 815
			-
				-
					Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 816
			-
				-
					Hath honoured me, according to his will.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 817
			-
				-
					Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 818
			-
				-
					That they may have their wish, to try with me
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 819
			-
				-
					In battle which the stronger proves; they all,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 820
			-
				-
					Or I alone against them; since by strength
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 821
			-
				-
					They measure all, of other excellence
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 822
			-
				-
					Not emulous, nor care who them excels;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 823
			-
				-
					Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 824
			-
				-
					So spake the Son, and into terrour changed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 825
			-
				-
					His countenance too severe to be beheld,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 826
			-
				-
					And full of wrath bent on his enemies.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 827
			-
				-
					At once the Four spread out their starry wings
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 828
			-
				-
					With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 829
			-
				-
					Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 830
			-
				-
					Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 831
			-
				-
					He on his impious foes right onward drove,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 832
			-
				-
					Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 833
			-
				-
					The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 834
			-
				-
					All but the throne itself of God. Full soon
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 835
			-
				-
					Among them he arrived; in his right hand
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 836
			-
				-
					Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 837
			-
				-
					Before him, such as in their souls infixed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 838
			-
				-
					Plagues: They, astonished, all resistance lost,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 839
			-
				-
					All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 840
			-
				-
					O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 841
			-
				-
					Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 842
			-
				-
					That wished the mountains now might be again
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 843
			-
				-
					Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 844
			-
				-
					Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 845
			-
				-
					His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 846
			-
				-
					Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 847
			-
				-
					Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 848
			-
				-
					One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 849
			-
				-
					Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 850
			-
				-
					Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 851
			-
				-
					And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 852
			-
				-
					Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 853
			-
				-
					Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 854
			-
				-
					His thunder in mid volley; for he meant
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 855
			-
				-
					Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 856
			-
				-
					The overthrown he raised, and as a herd
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 857
			-
				-
					Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 858
			-
				-
					Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 859
			-
				-
					With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 860
			-
				-
					And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 861
			-
				-
					Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 862
			-
				-
					Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 863
			-
				-
					Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 864
			-
				-
					Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 865
			-
				-
					Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 866
			-
				-
					Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 867
			-
				-
					Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 868
			-
				-
					Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 869
			-
				-
					Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 870
			-
				-
					Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 871
			-
				-
					Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 872
			-
				-
					And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 873
			-
				-
					Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 874
			-
				-
					Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 875
			-
				-
					Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 876
			-
				-
					Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 877
			-
				-
					Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 878
			-
				-
					Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 879
			-
				-
					Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 880
			-
				-
					Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 881
			-
				-
					Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 882
			-
				-
					To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 883
			-
				-
					Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 884
			-
				-
					With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 885
			-
				-
					Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 886
			-
				-
					Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 887
			-
				-
					Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 888
			-
				-
					Worthiest to reign: He, celebrated, rode
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 889
			-
				-
					Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 890
			-
				-
					And temple of his Mighty Father throned
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 891
			-
				-
					On high; who into glory him received,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 892
			-
				-
					Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 893
			-
				-
					Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 894
			-
				-
					At thy request, and that thou mayest beware
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 895
			-
				-
					By what is past, to thee I have revealed
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 896
			-
				-
					What might have else to human race been hid;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 897
			-
				-
					The discord which befel, and war in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 898
			-
				-
					Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 899
			-
				-
					Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 900
			-
				-
					With Satan; he who envies now thy state,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 901
			-
				-
					Who now is plotting how he may seduce
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 902
			-
				-
					Thee also from obedience, that, with him
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 903
			-
				-
					Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 904
			-
				-
					His punishment, eternal misery;
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 905
			-
				-
					Which would be all his solace and revenge,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 906
			-
				-
					As a despite done against the Most High,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 907
			-
				-
					Thee once to gain companion of his woe.
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 908
			-
				-
					But listen not to his temptations, warn
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 909
			-
				-
					Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 910
			-
				-
					By terrible example, the reward
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 911
			-
				-
					Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
				-
			-
				Book 6: Line 912
			-
				-
					Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
				-

			Book 7

				-
					Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 2
			-
				-
					If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 3
			-
				-
					Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 4
			-
				-
					Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 5
			-
				-
					The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 6
			-
				-
					Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 7
			-
				-
					Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 8
			-
				-
					Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 9
			-
				-
					Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 10
			-
				-
					Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 11
			-
				-
					In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 12
			-
				-
					With thy celestial song. Up led by thee
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 13
			-
				-
					Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 14
			-
				-
					An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 15
			-
				-
					Thy tempering: with like safety guided down
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 16
			-
				-
					Return me to my native element:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 17
			-
				-
					Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 18
			-
				-
					Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 19
			-
				-
					Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 20
			-
				-
					Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 21
			-
				-
					Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 22
			-
				-
					Within the visible diurnal sphere;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 23
			-
				-
					Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 24
			-
				-
					More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 25
			-
				-
					To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 26
			-
				-
					On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 27
			-
				-
					In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 28
			-
				-
					And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 29
			-
				-
					Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 30
			-
				-
					Purples the east: still govern thou my song,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 31
			-
				-
					Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 32
			-
				-
					But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 33
			-
				-
					Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 34
			-
				-
					Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 35
			-
				-
					In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 36
			-
				-
					To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 37
			-
				-
					Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 38
			-
				-
					Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 39
			-
				-
					For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 40
			-
				-
					Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 41
			-
				-
					The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 42
			-
				-
					Adam, by dire example, to beware
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 43
			-
				-
					Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 44
			-
				-
					To those apostates; lest the like befall
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 45
			-
				-
					In Paradise to Adam or his race,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 46
			-
				-
					Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 47
			-
				-
					If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 48
			-
				-
					So easily obeyed amid the choice
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 49
			-
				-
					Of all tastes else to please their appetite,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 50
			-
				-
					Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 51
			-
				-
					The story heard attentive, and was filled
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 52
			-
				-
					With admiration and deep muse, to hear
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 53
			-
				-
					Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 54
			-
				-
					So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 55
			-
				-
					And war so near the peace of God in bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 56
			-
				-
					With such confusion: but the evil, soon
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 57
			-
				-
					Driven back, redounded as a flood on those
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 58
			-
				-
					From whom it sprung; impossible to mix
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 59
			-
				-
					With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 60
			-
				-
					The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 61
			-
				-
					Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 62
			-
				-
					What nearer might concern him, how this world
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 63
			-
				-
					Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 64
			-
				-
					When, and whereof created; for what cause;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 65
			-
				-
					What within Eden, or without, was done
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 66
			-
				-
					Before his memory; as one whose drouth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 67
			-
				-
					Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 68
			-
				-
					Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 69
			-
				-
					Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 70
			-
				-
					Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 71
			-
				-
					Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 72
			-
				-
					Divine interpreter! by favour sent
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 73
			-
				-
					Down from the empyrean, to forewarn
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 74
			-
				-
					Us timely of what might else have been our loss,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 75
			-
				-
					Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 76
			-
				-
					For which to the infinitely Good we owe
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 77
			-
				-
					Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 78
			-
				-
					Receive, with solemn purpose to observe
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 79
			-
				-
					Immutably his sovran will, the end
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 80
			-
				-
					Of what we are. But since thou hast vouchsafed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 81
			-
				-
					Gently, for our instruction, to impart
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 82
			-
				-
					Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 83
			-
				-
					Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 84
			-
				-
					Deign to descend now lower, and relate
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 85
			-
				-
					What may no less perhaps avail us known,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 86
			-
				-
					How first began this Heaven which we behold
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 87
			-
				-
					Distant so high, with moving fires adorned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 88
			-
				-
					Innumerable; and this which yields or fills
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 89
			-
				-
					All space, the ambient air wide interfused
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 90
			-
				-
					Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 91
			-
				-
					Moved the Creator, in his holy rest
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 92
			-
				-
					Through all eternity, so late to build
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 93
			-
				-
					In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 94
			-
				-
					Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 95
			-
				-
					What we, not to explore the secrets ask
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 96
			-
				-
					Of his eternal empire, but the more
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 97
			-
				-
					To magnify his works, the more we know.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 98
			-
				-
					And the great light of day yet wants to run
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 99
			-
				-
					Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 100
			-
				-
					Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 101
			-
				-
					And longer will delay to hear thee tell
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 102
			-
				-
					His generation, and the rising birth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 103
			-
				-
					Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 104
			-
				-
					Or if the star of evening and the moon
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 105
			-
				-
					Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 106
			-
				-
					Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 107
			-
				-
					Or we can bid his absence, till thy song
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 108
			-
				-
					End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 109
			-
				-
					Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 110
			-
				-
					And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 111
			-
				-
					This also thy request, with caution asked,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 112
			-
				-
					Obtain; though to recount almighty works
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 113
			-
				-
					What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 114
			-
				-
					Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 115
			-
				-
					Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 116
			-
				-
					To glorify the Maker, and infer
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 117
			-
				-
					Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 118
			-
				-
					Thy hearing; such commission from above
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 119
			-
				-
					I have received, to answer thy desire
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 120
			-
				-
					Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 121
			-
				-
					To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 122
			-
				-
					Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 123
			-
				-
					Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 124
			-
				-
					To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 125
			-
				-
					Enough is left besides to search and know.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 126
			-
				-
					But knowledge is as food, and needs no less
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 127
			-
				-
					Her temperance over appetite, to know
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 128
			-
				-
					In measure what the mind may well contain;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 129
			-
				-
					Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 130
			-
				-
					Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 131
			-
				-
					Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 132
			-
				-
					(So call him, brighter once amidst the host
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 133
			-
				-
					Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 134
			-
				-
					Fell with his flaming legions through the deep
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 135
			-
				-
					Into his place, and the great Son returned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 136
			-
				-
					Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 137
			-
				-
					Eternal Father from his throne beheld
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 138
			-
				-
					Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 139
			-
				-
					At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 140
			-
				-
					All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 141
			-
				-
					This inaccessible high strength, the seat
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 142
			-
				-
					Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 143
			-
				-
					He trusted to have seised, and into fraud
				-

				Book 7: Line 144
			-
				-
					Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 145
			-
				-
					Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 146
			-
				-
					Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 147
			-
				-
					Number sufficient to possess her realms
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 148
			-
				-
					Though wide, and this high temple to frequent
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 149
			-
				-
					With ministeries due, and solemn rites:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 150
			-
				-
					But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 151
			-
				-
					Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 152
			-
				-
					My damage fondly deemed, I can repair
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 153
			-
				-
					That detriment, if such it be to lose
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 154
			-
				-
					Self-lost; and in a moment will create
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 155
			-
				-
					Another world, out of one man a race
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 156
			-
				-
					Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 157
			-
				-
					Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 158
			-
				-
					They open to themselves at length the way
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 159
			-
				-
					Up hither, under long obedience tried;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 160
			-
				-
					And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 161
			-
				-
					One kingdom, joy and union without end.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 162
			-
				-
					Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 163
			-
				-
					And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 164
			-
				-
					This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 165
			-
				-
					My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 166
			-
				-
					I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep

					Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;

				Book 7: Line 168
			-

					Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill

			-
				Book 7: Line 169
			-
				-
					Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 170
			-
				-
					Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 171
			-
				-
					And put not forth my goodness, which is free
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 172
			-
				-
					To act or not, Necessity and Chance
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 173
			-
				-
					Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 174
			-
				-
					So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 175
			-
				-
					His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 176
			-
				-
					Immediate are the acts of God, more swift
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 177
			-
				-
					Than time or motion, but to human ears
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 178
			-
				-
					Cannot without process of speech be told,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 179
			-
				-
					So told as earthly notion can receive.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 180
			-
				-
					Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 181
			-
				-
					When such was heard declared the Almighty's will;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 182
			-
				-
					Glory they sung to the Most High, good will
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 183
			-
				-
					To future men, and in their dwellings peace;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 184
			-
				-
					Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 185
			-
				-
					Had driven out the ungodly from his sight
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 186
			-
				-
					And the habitations of the just; to Him
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 187
			-
				-
					Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 188
			-
				-
					Good out of evil to create; instead
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 189
			-
				-
					Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 190
			-
				-
					Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 191
			-
				-
					His good to worlds and ages infinite.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 192
			-
				-
					So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 193
			-
				-
					On his great expedition now appeared,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 194
			-
				-
					Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 195
			-
				-
					Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 196
			-
				-
					Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 197
			-
				-
					About his chariot numberless were poured
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 198
			-
				-
					Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 199
			-
				-
					And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 200
			-
				-
					From the armoury of God; where stand of old
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 201
			-
				-
					Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 202
			-
				-
					Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 203
			-
				-
					Celestial equipage; and now came forth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 204
			-
				-
					Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 205
			-
				-
					Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 206
			-
				-
					Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 207
			-
				-
					On golden hinges moving, to let forth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 208
			-
				-
					The King of Glory, in his powerful Word
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 209
			-
				-
					And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 210
			-
				-
					On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 211
			-
				-
					They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 212
			-
				-
					Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 213
			-
				-
					Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 214
			-
				-
					And surging waves, as mountains, to assault
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 215
			-
				-
					Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 216
			-
				-
					Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 217
			-
				-
					Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 218
			-
				-
					Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 219
			-
				-
					Uplifted, in paternal glory rode
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 220
			-
				-
					Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 221
			-
				-
					For Chaos heard his voice: Him all his train
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 222
			-
				-
					Followed in bright procession, to behold
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 223
			-
				-
					Creation, and the wonders of his might.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 224
			-
				-
					Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 225
			-
				-
					He took the golden compasses, prepared
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 226
			-
				-
					In God's eternal store, to circumscribe
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 227
			-
				-
					This universe, and all created things:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 228
			-
				-
					One foot he centered, and the other turned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 229
			-
				-
					Round through the vast profundity obscure;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 230
			-
				-
					And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 231
			-
				-
					This be thy just circumference, O World!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 232
			-
				-
					Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 233
			-
				-
					Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 234
			-
				-
					Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 235
			-
				-
					His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 236
			-
				-
					And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 237
			-
				-
					Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 238
			-
				-
					The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 239
			-
				-
					Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 240
			-
				-
					Like things to like; the rest to several place
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 241
			-
				-
					Disparted, and between spun out the air;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 242
			-
				-
					And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 243
			-
				-
					Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 244
			-
				-
					Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 245
			-
				-
					Sprung from the deep; and from her native east
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 246
			-
				-
					To journey through the aery gloom began,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 247
			-
				-
					Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 248
			-
				-
					Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 249
			-
				-
					Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 250
			-
				-
					And light from darkness by the hemisphere
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 251
			-
				-
					Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 252
			-
				-
					He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 253
			-
				-
					Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 254
			-
				-
					By the celestial quires, when orient light
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 255
			-
				-
					Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 256
			-
				-
					Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 257
			-
				-
					The hollow universal orb they filled,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 258
			-
				-
					And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 259
			-
				-
					God and his works; Creator him they sung,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 260
			-
				-
					Both when first evening was, and when first morn.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 261
			-
				-
					Again, God said, Let there be firmament
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 262
			-
				-
					Amid the waters, and let it divide
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 263
			-
				-
					The waters from the waters; and God made
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 264
			-
				-
					The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 265
			-
				-
					Transparent, elemental air, diffused
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 266
			-
				-
					In circuit to the uttermost convex
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 267
			-
				-
					Of this great round; partition firm and sure,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 268
			-
				-
					The waters underneath from those above
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 269
			-
				-
					Dividing: for as earth, so he the world
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 270
			-
				-
					Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 271
			-
				-
					Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 272
			-
				-
					Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 273
			-
				-
					Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 274
			-
				-
					And Heaven he named the Firmament: So even
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 275
			-
				-
					And morning chorus sung the second day.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 276
			-
				-
					The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 277
			-
				-
					Of waters, embryon immature involved,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 278
			-
				-
					Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 279
			-
				-
					Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 280
			-
				-
					Prolifick humour softening all her globe,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 281
			-
				-
					Fermented the great mother to conceive,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 282
			-
				-
					Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 283
			-
				-
					Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 284
			-
				-
					Into one place, and let dry land appear.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 285
			-
				-
					Immediately the mountains huge appear
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 286
			-
				-
					Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 287
			-
				-
					Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 288
			-
				-
					So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 289
			-
				-
					Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 290
			-
				-
					Capacious bed of waters: Thither they
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 291
			-
				-
					Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 292
			-
				-
					As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 293
			-
				-
					Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 294
			-
				-
					For haste; such flight the great command impressed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 295
			-
				-
					On the swift floods: As armies at the call
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 296
			-
				-
					Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 297
			-
				-
					Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 298
			-
				-
					Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 299
			-
				-
					If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 300
			-
				-
					Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 301
			-
				-
					But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 302
			-
				-
					With serpent errour wandering, found their way,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 303
			-
				-
					And on the washy oose deep channels wore;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 304
			-
				-
					Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 305
			-
				-
					All but within those banks, where rivers now
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 306
			-
				-
					Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 307
			-
				-
					The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 308
			-
				-
					Of congregated waters, he called Seas:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 309
			-
				-
					And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 310
			-
				-
					Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 311
			-
				-
					And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 312
			-
				-
					Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 313
			-
				-
					He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 314
			-
				-
					Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 315
			-
				-
					Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 316
			-
				-
					Her universal face with pleasant green;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 317
			-
				-
					Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 318
			-
				-
					Opening their various colours, and made gay
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 319
			-
				-
					Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 320
			-
				-
					Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 321
			-
				-
					The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 322
			-
				-
					Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 323
			-
				-
					And bush with frizzled hair implicit: Last
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 324
			-
				-
					Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 325
			-
				-
					Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 326
			-
				-
					Their blossoms: With high woods the hills were crowned;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 327
			-
				-
					With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 328
			-
				-
					With borders long the rivers: that Earth now
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 329
			-
				-
					Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 330
			-
				-
					Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 331
			-
				-
					Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 332
			-
				-
					Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 333
			-
				-
					None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 334
			-
				-
					Went up, and watered all the ground, and each
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 335
			-
				-
					Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 336
			-
				-
					God made, and every herb, before it grew
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 337
			-
				-
					On the green stem: God saw that it was good:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 338
			-
				-
					So even and morn recorded the third day.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 339
			-
				-
					Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 340
			-
				-
					High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 341
			-
				-
					The day from night; and let them be for signs,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 342
			-
				-
					For seasons, and for days, and circling years;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 343
			-
				-
					And let them be for lights, as I ordain
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 344
			-
				-
					Their office in the firmament of Heaven,

					To give light on the Earth; and it was so.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 346
			-
				-
					And God made two great lights, great for their use
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 347
			-
				-
					To Man, the greater to have rule by day,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 348
			-
				-
					The less by night, altern; and made the stars,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 349
			-
				-
					And set them in the firmament of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 350
			-
				-
					To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 351
			-
				-
					In their vicissitude, and rule the night,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 352
			-
				-
					And light from darkness to divide. God saw,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 353
			-
				-
					Surveying his great work, that it was good:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 354
			-
				-
					For of celestial bodies first the sun
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 355
			-
				-
					A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 356
			-
				-
					Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 357
			-
				-
					Globose, and every magnitude of stars,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 358
			-
				-
					And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 359
			-
				-
					Of light by far the greater part he took,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 360
			-
				-
					Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 361
			-
				-
					In the sun's orb, made porous to receive
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 362
			-
				-
					And drink the liquid light; firm to retain
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 363
			-
				-
					Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 364
			-
				-
					Hither, as to their fountain, other stars
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 365
			-
				-
					Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 366
			-

					And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;

				Book 7: Line 367

					By tincture or reflection they augment

				Book 7: Line 368
			-

					Their small peculiar, though from human sight
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 369
			-
				-
					So far remote, with diminution seen,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 370
			-
				-
					First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 371
			-
				-
					Regent of day, and all the horizon round
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 372

					Invested with bright rays, jocund to run

				Book 7: Line 373
			-

					His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 374
			-
				-
					Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 375
			-
				-
					Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 376
			-
				-
					But opposite in levelled west was set,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 377
			-
				-
					His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 378
			-
				-
					From him; for other light she needed none
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 379
			-
				-
					In that aspect, and still that distance keeps

				Book 7: Line 380

			-
				-
					Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 382
			-
				-
					With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 383
			-
				-
					With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 384
			-
				-
					Spangling the hemisphere: Then first adorned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 385
			-
				-
					With their bright luminaries that set and rose,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 386
			-
				-
					Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 387
			-
				-
					And God said, Let the waters generate
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 388
			-
				-
					Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 389
			-
				-
					And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 390
			-
				-
					Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 391
			-

					And God created the great whales, and each
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 392
			-
				-
					Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 393
			-
				-
					The waters generated by their kinds;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 394
			-
				-
					And every bird of wing after his kind;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 395
			-
				-
					And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 396
			-
				-
					Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 397
			-

					And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;

			-
				Book 7: Line 398

					And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.
				-

				Book 7: Line 399
			-
				-
					Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 400
			-
				-
					With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 401
			-
				-
					Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 402
			-
				-
					Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 403
			-
				-
					Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 404
			-
				-
					Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 405
			-
				-
					Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 406
			-
				-
					Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 407
			-
				-
					Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend

			-
				Book 7: Line 408
			-
				-
					Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 409
			-
				-
					In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 410
			-
				-
					And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 411
			-
				-
					Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 412
			-
				-
					Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 413
			-
				-
					Hugest of living creatures, on the deep
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 414
			-
				-
					Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 415
			-
				-
					And seems a moving land; and at his gills
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 416
			-
				-
					Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 417
			-
				-
					Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 418
			-
				-
					Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 419
			-
				-
					Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 420
			-
				-
					Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 421
			-
				-
					They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 422
			-
				-
					With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 423
			-
				-
					In prospect; there the eagle and the stork
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 424
			-
				-
					On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 425
			-

					Part loosely wing the region, part more wise
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 426
			-
				-
					In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 427
			-
				-
					Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 428
			-
				-
					Their aery caravan, high over seas
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 429
			-
				-
					Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 430
			-
				-
					Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 431
			-
				-
					Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 432
			-
				-
					Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 433
			-
				-
					From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 434
			-
				-
					Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 435
			-
				-
					Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 436
			-
				-
					Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 437
			-
				-
					Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 438
			-
				-
					Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 439
			-
				-
					Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 440
			-
				-
					Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 441
			-
				-
					The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 442
			-
				-
					The mid aereal sky: Others on ground
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 443
			-
				-
					Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 444
			-
				-
					The silent hours, and the other whose gay train
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 445
			-
				-
					Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 446
			-
				-
					Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 447
			-
				-
					With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 448
			-
				-
					Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 449
			-
				-
					The sixth, and of creation last, arose
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 450
			-
				-
					With evening harps and matin; when God said,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 451
			-
				-
					Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 452
			-
				-
					Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 453
			-
				-
					Each in their kind. The Earth obeyed, and straight
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 454
			-
				-
					Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 455
			-
				-
					Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 456
			-
				-
					Limbed and full grown: Out of the ground up rose,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 457
			-
				-
					As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 458
			-
				-
					In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 459
			-
				-
					Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 460
			-
				-
					The cattle in the fields and meadows green:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 461
			-
				-
					Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 462
			-
				-
					Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 463
			-
				-
					The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 464
			-
				-
					The tawny lion, pawing to get free
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 465
			-
				-
					His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 466
			-
				-
					And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 467
			-
				-
					The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 468
			-
				-
					Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 469
			-
				-
					In hillocks: The swift stag from under ground
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 470
			-
				-
					Bore up his branching head: Scarce from his mould
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 471
			-
				-
					Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 472
			-
				-
					His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 473
			-
				-
					As plants: Ambiguous between sea and land
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 474
			-
				-
					The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 475
			-
				-
					At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 476
			-
				-
					Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 477
			-
				-
					For wings, and smallest lineaments exact
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 478
			-
				-
					In all the liveries decked of summer's pride
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 479
			-
				-
					With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 480
			-
				-
					These, as a line, their long dimension drew,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 481
			-
				-
					Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 482
			-
				-
					Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 483
			-
				-
					Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 484
			-
				-
					Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 485
			-
				-
					The parsimonious emmet, provident
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 486
			-
				-
					Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 487
			-
				-
					Pattern of just equality perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 488
			-
				-
					Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 489
			-
				-
					Of commonalty: Swarming next appeared
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 490
			-
				-
					The female bee, that feeds her husband drone
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 491
			-
				-
					Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 492
			-
				-
					With honey stored: The rest are numberless,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 493
			-
				-
					And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 494
			-
				-
					Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 495
			-
				-
					The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 496
			-
				-
					Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 497
			-
				-
					And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 498
			-
				-
					Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 499
			-
				-
					Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 500
			-
				-
					Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 501
			-
				-
					First wheeled their course: Earth in her rich attire
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 502
			-
				-
					Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 503
			-
				-
					By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 504
			-
				-
					Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 505
			-
				-
					There wanted yet the master-work, the end
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 506
			-
				-
					Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 507
			-
				-
					And brute as other creatures, but endued
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 508
			-
				-
					With sanctity of reason, might erect
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 509
			-
				-
					His stature, and upright with front serene
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 510
			-
				-
					Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 511
			-
				-
					Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 512
			-
				-
					But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 513
			-
				-
					Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 514
			-
				-
					Directed in devotion, to adore
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 515
			-
				-
					And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 516
			-
				-
					Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 517
			-
				-
					Eternal Father (for where is not he
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 518
			-
				-
					Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 519
			-
				-
					Let us make now Man in our image, Man
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 520
			-
				-
					In our similitude, and let them rule
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 521
			-
				-
					Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 522
			-
				-
					Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 523
			-
				-
					And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 524
			-
				-
					This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 525
			-
				-
					Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 526
			-
				-
					The breath of life; in his own image he
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 527
			-
				-
					Created thee, in the image of God
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 528
			-
				-
					Express; and thou becamest a living soul.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 529
			-
				-
					Male he created thee; but thy consort
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 530
			-
				-
					Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 531
			-
				-
					Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 532
			-
				-
					Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 533
			-
				-
					Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 534
			-
				-
					And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 535
			-
				-
					Wherever thus created, for no place
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 536
			-
				-
					Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 537
			-
				-
					He brought thee into this delicious grove,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 538
			-
				-
					This garden, planted with the trees of God,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 539
			-
				-
					Delectable both to behold and taste;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 540
			-
				-
					And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 541
			-
				-
					Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 542
			-
				-
					Variety without end; but of the tree,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 543
			-
				-
					Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 544

					Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;

				Book 7: Line 545
			-
				-
					Death is the penalty imposed; beware,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 546
			-
				-
					And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 547
			-
				-
					Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 548
			-
				-
					Here finished he, and all that he had made
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 549
			-
				-
					Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 550
			-
				-
					So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 551
			-
				-
					Yet not till the Creator from his work
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 552
			-
				-
					Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 553
			-
				-
					Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 554
			-
				-
					Thence to behold this new created world,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 555
			-
				-
					The addition of his empire, how it showed
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 556
			-
				-
					In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 557
			-
				-
					Answering his great idea. Up he rode
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 558
			-
				-
					Followed with acclamation, and the sound
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 559
			-
				-
					Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 560
			-
				-
					Angelick harmonies: The earth, the air
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 561
			-
				-
					Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 562
			-
				-
					The heavens and all the constellations rung,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 563
			-
				-
					The planets in their station listening stood,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 564
			-
				-
					While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 565
			-
				-
					Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 566
			-
				-
					Open, ye Heavens! your living doors; let in
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 567
			-
				-
					The great Creator from his work returned
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 568
			-
				-
					Magnificent, his six days work, a World;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 569
			-
				-
					Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 570
			-
				-
					To visit oft the dwellings of just men,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 571
			-
				-
					Delighted; and with frequent intercourse
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 572
			-
				-
					Thither will send his winged messengers
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 573
			-
				-
					On errands of supernal grace. So sung
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 574
			-
				-
					The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 575
			-
				-
					That opened wide her blazing portals, led
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 576
			-
				-
					To God's eternal house direct the way;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 577
			-
				-
					A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 578
			-
				-
					And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 579
			-
				-
					Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 580
			-
				-
					Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 581
			-
				-
					Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 582
			-
				-
					Evening arose in Eden, for the sun
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 583
			-
				-
					Was set, and twilight from the east came on,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 584
			-
				-
					Forerunning night; when at the holy mount
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 585
			-
				-
					Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 586
			-
				-
					Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 587
			-
				-
					The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 588
			-
				-
					With his great Father; for he also went
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 589
			-
				-
					Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 590
			-
				-
					Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 591
			-
				-
					Author and End of all things; and, from work
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 592
			-
				-
					Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 593
			-
				-
					As resting on that day from all his work,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 594
			-
				-
					But not in silence holy kept: the harp
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 595
			-
				-
					Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 596
			-
				-
					And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 597
			-
				-
					All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 598
			-
				-
					Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 599
			-
				-
					Choral or unison: of incense clouds,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 600
			-
				-
					Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 601
			-
				-
					Creation and the six days acts they sung:
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 602
			-
				-
					Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 603
			-
				-
					Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 604
			-
				-
					Relate thee! Greater now in thy return
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 605
			-
				-
					Than from the giant Angels: Thee that day
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 606
			-
				-
					Thy thunders magnified; but to create
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 607
			-
				-
					Is greater than created to destroy.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 608
			-
				-
					Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 609
			-
				-
					Thy empire! Easily the proud attempt
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 610
			-
				-
					Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 611
			-
				-
					Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 612
			-
				-
					Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 613
			-
				-
					The number of thy worshippers. Who seeks
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 614
			-
				-
					To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 615
			-
				-
					To manifest the more thy might: his evil
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 616
			-
				-
					Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 617
			-
				-
					Witness this new-made world, another Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 618
			-
				-
					From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 619
			-
				-
					On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 620
			-
				-
					Of amplitude almost immense, with stars
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 621
			-
				-
					Numerous, and every star perhaps a world
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 622
			-
				-
					Of destined habitation; but thou knowest
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 623
			-
				-
					Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 624
			-
				-
					Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 625
			-
				-
					Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 626
			-
				-
					And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 627
			-
				-
					Created in his image, there to dwell
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 628
			-
				-
					And worship him; and in reward to rule
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 629
			-
				-
					Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 630
			-
				-
					And multiply a race of worshippers
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 631
			-
				-
					Holy and just: Thrice happy, if they know
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 632
			-
				-
					Their happiness, and persevere upright!
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 633
			-
				-
					So sung they, and the empyrean rung
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 634
			-
				-
					With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 635
			-
				-
					And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 636
			-
				-
					How first this world and face of things began,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 637
			-
				-
					And what before thy memory was done
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 638
			-
				-
					From the beginning; that posterity,
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 639
			-
				-
					Informed by thee, might know: If else thou seekest
				-
			-
				Book 7: Line 640
			-
				-
					Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

				Book 8: Line 1

				-
					The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 2
			-
				-
					So charming left his voice, that he a while
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 3
			-
				-
					Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 4
			-
				-
					Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 5
			-
				-
					What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 6
			-
				-
					Equal, have I to render thee, divine
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 7
			-
				-
					Historian, who thus largely hast allayed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 8
			-
				-
					The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 9
			-
				-
					This friendly condescension to relate
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 10
			-
				-
					Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 11
			-
				-
					With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 12
			-
				-
					With glory attributed to the high
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 13
			-
				-
					Creator! Something yet of doubt remains,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 14
			-
				-
					Which only thy solution can resolve.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 15
			-
				-
					When I behold this goodly frame, this world,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 16
			-
				-
					Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 17
			-
				-
					Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 18
			-
				-
					An atom, with the firmament compared
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 19
			-
				-
					And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 20
			-
				-
					Spaces incomprehensible, (for such
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 21
			-
				-
					Their distance argues, and their swift return
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 22
			-
				-
					Diurnal,) merely to officiate light
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 23
			-
				-
					Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 24
			-
				-
					One day and night; in all her vast survey
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 25
			-
				-
					Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 26
			-
				-
					How Nature wise and frugal could commit
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 27
			-
				-
					Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 28
			-
				-
					So many nobler bodies to create,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 29
			-
				-
					Greater so manifold, to this one use,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 30
			-
				-
					For aught appears, and on their orbs impose
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 31
			-
				-
					Such restless revolution day by day
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 32
			-
				-
					Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 33
			-
				-
					That better might with far less compass move,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 34
			-
				-
					Served by more noble than herself, attains
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 35
			-
				-
					Her end without least motion, and receives,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 36
			-
				-
					As tribute, such a sumless journey brought
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 37
			-
				-
					Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 38
			-
				-
					Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 39
			-
				-
					So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 40
			-
				-
					Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 41
			-
				-
					Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 42
			-
				-
					With lowliness majestick from her seat,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 43
			-
				-
					And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 44
			-
				-
					Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 45
			-
				-
					To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 46
			-
				-
					Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 47
			-
				-
					And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 48
			-
				-
					Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 49
			-
				-
					Delighted, or not capable her ear
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 50
			-
				-
					Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 51
			-
				-
					Adam relating, she sole auditress;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 52
			-
				-
					Her husband the relater she preferred
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 53
			-
				-
					Before the Angel, and of him to ask
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 54
			-
				-
					Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 55
			-
				-
					Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 56
			-
				-
					With conjugal caresses: from his lip
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 57
			-
				-
					Not words alone pleased her. O! when meet now
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 58
			-
				-
					Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 59
			-
				-
					With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 60
			-
				-
					Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 61
			-
				-
					A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 62
			-
				-
					And from about her shot darts of desire
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 63
			-
				-
					Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 64
			-
				-
					And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 65
			-
				-
					Benevolent and facile thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 66
			-
				-
					To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 67
			-
				-
					Is as the book of God before thee set,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 68
			-
				-
					Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 69
			-
				-
					His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 70
			-
				-
					This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 71
			-
				-
					Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 72
			-
				-
					From Man or Angel the great Architect
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 73
			-
				-
					Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 74
			-
				-
					His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 75
			-
				-
					Rather admire; or, if they list to try
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 76
			-
				-
					Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 77
			-
				-
					Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 78
			-
				-
					His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 79
			-
				-
					Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 80
			-
				-
					And calculate the stars, how they will wield
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 81
			-
				-
					The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 82
			-
				-
					To save appearances; how gird the sphere
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 83
			-
				-
					With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 84
			-
				-
					Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 85
			-
				-
					Already by thy reasoning this I guess,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 86
			-
				-
					Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 87
			-
				-
					That bodies bright and greater should not serve
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 88
			-
				-
					The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 89
			-
				-
					Earth sitting still, when she alone receives
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 90
			-
				-
					The benefit: Consider first, that great
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 91
			-
				-
					Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 92
			-
				-
					Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 93
			-
				-
					Nor glistering, may of solid good contain
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 94
			-
				-
					More plenty than the sun that barren shines;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 95
			-
				-
					Whose virtue on itself works no effect,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 96
			-
				-
					But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 97
			-
				-
					His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 98
			-
				-
					Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 99
			-
				-
					Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 100
			-
				-
					And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 101
			-
				-
					The Maker's high magnificence, who built
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 102
			-
				-
					So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 103
			-
				-
					That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 104
			-
				-
					An edifice too large for him to fill,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 105
			-
				-
					Lodged in a small partition; and the rest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 106
			-
				-
					Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 107
			-
				-
					The swiftness of those circles attribute,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 108
			-
				-
					Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,

				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 173
			-
				-
					To know what passes there; be lowly wise:
				-

				Book 8: Line 174

					Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 175
			-

					Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there
				-

				Book 8: Line 176
			-
				-
					Live, in what state, condition, or degree;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 177
			-
				-
					Contented that thus far hath been revealed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 178
			-
				-
					Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 179
			-
				-
					To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 180
			-
				-
					How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 181
			-
				-
					Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 182
			-
				-
					And, freed from intricacies, taught to live
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 183
			-
				-
					The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 184
			-
				-
					To interrupt the sweet of life, from which
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 185
			-
				-
					God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 186
			-
				-
					And not molest us; unless we ourselves
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 187
			-
				-
					Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 188
			-
				-
					But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 189
			-
				-
					Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 190
			-
				-
					Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 191
			-
				-
					That, not to know at large of things remote
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 192
			-
				-
					From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 193
			-
				-
					That which before us lies in daily life,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 194
			-
				-
					Is the prime wisdom: What is more, is fume,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 195
			-
				-
					Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 196
			-
				-
					And renders us, in things that most concern,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 197
			-
				-
					Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 198
			-
				-
					Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 199
			-
				-
					A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 200
			-
				-
					Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 201
			-
				-
					Of something not unseasonable to ask,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 202
			-
				-
					By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 203
			-
				-
					Thee I have heard relating what was done
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 204
			-
				-
					Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 205
			-
				-
					My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 206
			-
				-
					And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 207
			-
				-
					How subtly to detain thee I devise;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 208
			-
				-
					Inviting thee to hear while I relate;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 209
			-
				-
					Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 210
			-
				-
					For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 211
			-
				-
					And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 212
			-
				-
					Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 213
			-
				-
					And hunger both, from labour, at the hour
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 214
			-
				-
					Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 215
			-
				-
					Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 216
			-
				-
					Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 217
			-
				-
					To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 218
			-
				-
					Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 219
			-
				-
					Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 220
			-
				-
					Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 221
			-
				-
					Inward and outward both, his image fair:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 222
			-
				-
					Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 223
			-
				-
					Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 224
			-
				-
					Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 225
			-
				-
					Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 226
			-
				-
					Gladly into the ways of God with Man:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 227
			-
				-
					For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 228
			-
				-
					On Man his equal love: Say therefore on;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 229
			-
				-
					For I that day was absent, as befel,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 230
			-
				-
					Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 231
			-
				-
					Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 232
			-
				-
					Squared in full legion (such command we had)
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 233
			-
				-
					To see that none thence issued forth a spy,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 234
			-
				-
					Or enemy, while God was in his work;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 235
			-
				-
					Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 236
			-
				-
					Destruction with creation might have mixed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 237
			-
				-
					Not that they durst without his leave attempt;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 238
			-
				-
					But us he sends upon his high behests
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 239
			-
				-
					For state, as Sovran King; and to inure
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 240
			-
				-
					Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 241
			-
				-
					The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 242
			-
				-
					But long ere our approaching heard within
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 243
			-
				-
					Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 244
			-
				-
					Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 245
			-
				-
					Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 246
			-
				-
					Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 247
			-
				-
					But thy relation now; for I attend,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 248
			-
				-
					Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 249
			-
				-
					So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 250
			-
				-
					For Man to tell how human life began
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 251
			-
				-
					Is hard; for who himself beginning knew
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 252
			-
				-
					Desire with thee still longer to converse
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 253
			-
				-
					Induced me. As new waked from soundest sleep,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 254
			-
				-
					Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 255
			-
				-
					In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 256
			-
				-
					Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 257
			-
				-
					Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 258
			-
				-
					And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 259
			-
				-
					By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 260
			-
				-
					As thitherward endeavouring, and upright
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 261
			-
				-
					Stood on my feet: about me round I saw
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 262
			-
				-
					Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 263
			-
				-
					And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 264
			-
				-
					Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 265
			-
				-
					Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 266
			-
				-
					With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 267
			-
				-
					Myself I then perused, and limb by limb
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 268
			-
				-
					Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 269
			-
				-
					With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 270
			-
				-
					But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 271
			-
				-
					Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 272
			-
				-
					My tongue obeyed, and readily could name
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 273
			-
				-
					Whate'er I saw. Thou Sun, said I, fair light,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 274
			-
				-
					And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 275
			-
				-
					Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 276
			-
				-
					And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 277
			-
				-
					Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here? -
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 278
			-
				-
					Not of myself; - by some great Maker then,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 279
			-
				-
					In goodness and in power pre-eminent:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 280
			-
				-
					Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 281
			-
				-
					From whom I have that thus I move and live,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 282
			-
				-
					And feel that I am happier than I know. -
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 283
			-
				-
					While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 284
			-
				-
					From where I first drew air, and first beheld
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 285
			-
				-
					This happy light; when, answer none returned,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 286
			-
				-
					On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 287
			-
				-
					Pensive I sat me down: There gentle sleep
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 288
			-
				-
					First found me, and with soft oppression seised
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 289
			-
				-
					My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 290
			-
				-
					I then was passing to my former state
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 291
			-
				-
					Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 292
			-
				-
					When suddenly stood at my head a dream,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 293
			-
				-
					Whose inward apparition gently moved
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 294
			-
				-
					My fancy to believe I yet had being,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 295
			-
				-
					And lived: One came, methought, of shape divine,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 296
			-
				-
					And said, “Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 297
			-
				-
					First Man, of men innumerable ordained
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 298
			-
				-
					First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 299
			-
				-
					To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.”
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 300
			-
				-
					So saying, by the hand he took me raised,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 301
			-
				-
					And over fields and waters, as in air
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 302
			-
				-
					Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 303
			-
				-
					A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 304
			-
				-
					A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 305
			-
				-
					Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 306
			-
				-
					Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 307
			-
				-
					Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 308
			-
				-
					Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 309
			-
				-
					To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 310
			-
				-
					Before mine eyes all real, as the dream
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 311
			-
				-
					Had lively shadowed: Here had new begun
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 312
			-
				-
					My wandering, had not he, who was my guide
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 313
			-
				-
					Up hither, from among the trees appeared,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 314
			-
				-
					Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 315
			-
				-
					In adoration at his feet I fell
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 316
			-
				-
					Submiss: He reared me, and “Whom thou soughtest I am,”
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 317
			-
				-
					Said mildly, “Author of all this thou seest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 318
			-
				-
					Above, or round about thee, or beneath.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 319
			-
				-
					This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 320
			-
				-
					To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 321
			-
				-
					Of every tree that in the garden grows
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 322
			-
				-
					Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 323
			-
				-
					But of the tree whose operation brings
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 324
			-
				-
					Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 325
			-
				-
					The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 326
			-
				-
					Amid the garden by the tree of life,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 327
			-
				-
					Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 328
			-
				-
					And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 329
			-
				-
					The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 330
			-
				-
					Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 331
			-
				-
					From that day mortal; and this happy state
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 332
			-
				-
					Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 333
			-
				-
					Of woe and sorrow.” Sternly he pronounced
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 334
			-
				-
					The rigid interdiction, which resounds
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 335
			-
				-
					Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 336
			-
				-
					Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 337
			-
				-
					Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 338
			-
				-
					“Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 339
			-
				-
					To thee and to thy race I give; as lords
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 340
			-
				-
					Possess it, and all things that therein live,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 341
			-
				-
					Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 342
			-
				-
					In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 343
			-
				-
					After their kinds; I bring them to receive
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 344
			-
				-
					From thee their names, and pay thee fealty
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 345
			-
				-
					With low subjection; understand the same
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 346
			-
				-
					Of fish within their watery residence,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 347
			-
				-
					Not hither summoned, since they cannot change
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 348
			-
				-
					Their element, to draw the thinner air.”
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 349
			-
				-
					As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 350
			-
				-
					Approaching two and two; these cowering low
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 351
			-
				-
					With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 352
			-
				-
					I named them, as they passed, and understood
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 353
			-
				-
					Their nature, with such knowledge God endued
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 354
			-
				-
					My sudden apprehension: But in these
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 355
			-
				-
					I found not what methought I wanted still;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 356
			-
				-
					And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 357
			-
				-
					O, by what name, for thou above all these,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 358
			-
				-
					Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 359
			-
				-
					Surpassest far my naming; how may I
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 360
			-
				-
					Adore thee, Author of this universe,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 361
			-
				-
					And all this good to man? for whose well being
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 362
			-
				-
					So amply, and with hands so liberal,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 363
			-
				-
					Thou hast provided all things: But with me
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 364
			-
				-
					I see not who partakes. In solitude
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 365
			-
				-
					What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 366
			-
				-
					Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 367
			-
				-
					Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 368
			-
				-
					As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 369
			-
				-
					What callest thou solitude? Is not the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 370
			-
				-
					With various living creatures, and the air
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 371
			-
				-
					Replenished, and all these at thy command
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 372
			-
				-
					To come and play before thee? Knowest thou not
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 373
			-
				-
					Their language and their ways? They also know,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 374
			-
				-
					And reason not contemptibly: With these
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 375
			-
				-
					Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 376
			-
				-
					So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 377
			-
				-
					So ordering: I, with leave of speech implored,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 378
			-
				-
					And humble deprecation, thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 379
			-
				-
					Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 380
			-
				-
					My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 381
			-
				-
					Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 382
			-
				-
					And these inferiour far beneath me set?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 383
			-
				-
					Among unequals what society
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 384
			-
				-
					Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 385
			-
				-
					Which must be mutual, in proportion due
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 386
			-
				-
					Given and received; but, in disparity
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 387
			-
				-
					The one intense, the other still remiss,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 388
			-
				-
					Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 389
			-
				-
					Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 390
			-
				-
					Such as I seek, fit to participate
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 391
			-
				-
					All rational delight: wherein the brute
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 392
			-
				-
					Cannot be human consort: They rejoice
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 393
			-
				-
					Each with their kind, lion with lioness;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 394
			-
				-
					So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 395
			-
				-
					Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 396
			-
				-
					So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 397
			-
				-
					Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 398
			-
				-
					Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 399
			-
				-
					A nice and subtle happiness, I see,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 400
			-
				-
					Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 401
			-
				-
					Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 402
			-
				-
					No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 403
			-
				-
					What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 404
			-
				-
					Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 405
			-
				-
					Of happiness, or not? who am alone
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 406
			-
				-
					From all eternity; for none I know
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 407
			-
				-
					Second to me or like, equal much less.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 408
			-
				-
					How have I then with whom to hold converse,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 409
			-
				-
					Save with the creatures which I made, and those
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 410
			-
				-
					To me inferiour, infinite descents
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 411
			-
				-
					Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 412
			-
				-
					He ceased; I lowly answered. To attain
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 413
			-
				-
					The highth and depth of thy eternal ways
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 414
			-
				-
					All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 415
			-
				-
					Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 416
			-
				-
					Is no deficience found: Not so is Man,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 417
			-
				-
					But in degree; the cause of his desire
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 418
			-
				-
					By conversation with his like to help
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 419
			-
				-
					Or solace his defects. No need that thou
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 420
			-
				-
					Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 421
			-
				-
					And through all numbers absolute, though One:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 422
			-
				-
					But Man by number is to manifest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 423
			-
				-
					His single imperfection, and beget
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 424
			-
				-
					Like of his like, his image multiplied,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 425
			-
				-
					In unity defective; which requires
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 426
			-
				-
					Collateral love, and dearest amity.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 427
			-
				-
					Thou in thy secresy although alone,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 428
			-
				-
					Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 429
			-
				-
					Social communication; yet, so pleased,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 430
			-
				-
					Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 431
			-
				-
					Of union or communion, deified:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 432
			-
				-
					I, by conversing, cannot these erect
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 433
			-
				-
					From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 434
			-
				-
					Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 435
			-
				-
					Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 436
			-
				-
					This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 437
			-
				-
					Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 438
			-
				-
					And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 439
			-
				-
					Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 440
			-
				-
					Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 441
			-
				-
					My image, not imparted to the brute;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 442
			-
				-
					Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 443
			-
				-
					Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 444
			-
				-
					And be so minded still: I, ere thou spakest,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 445
			-
				-
					Knew it not good for Man to be alone;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 446
			-
				-
					And no such company as then thou sawest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 447
			-
				-
					Intended thee; for trial only brought,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 448
			-
				-
					To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 449
			-
				-
					What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 450
			-
				-
					Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 451
			-
				-
					Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 452
			-
				-
					He ended, or I heard no more; for now
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 453
			-
				-
					My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 454
			-
				-
					Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 455
			-
				-
					In that celestial colloquy sublime,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 456
			-
				-
					As with an object that excels the sense
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 457
			-
				-
					Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 458
			-
				-
					Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 459
			-
				-
					By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 460
			-
				-
					Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 461
			-
				-
					Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 462
			-
				-
					Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 463
			-
				-
					Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 464
			-
				-
					Still glorious before whom awake I stood:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 465
			-
				-
					Who stooping opened my left side, and took
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 466
			-
				-
					From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 467
			-
				-
					And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 468
			-
				-
					But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 469
			-
				-
					The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 470
			-
				-
					Under his forming hands a creature grew,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 471
			-
				-
					Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 472
			-
				-
					That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 473
			-
				-
					Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 474
			-
				-
					And in her looks; which from that time infused
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 475
			-
				-
					Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 476
			-
				-
					And into all things from her air inspired
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 477
			-
				-
					The spirit of love and amorous delight.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 478
			-
				-
					She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 479
			-
				-
					To find her, or for ever to deplore
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 480
			-
				-
					Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 481
			-
				-
					When out of hope, behold her, not far off,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 482
			-
				-
					Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 483
			-
				-
					With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 484
			-
				-
					To make her amiable: On she came,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 485
			-
				-
					Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 486
			-
				-
					And guided by his voice; nor uninformed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 487
			-
				-
					Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 488
			-
				-
					Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 489
			-
				-
					In every gesture dignity and love.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 490
			-
				-
					I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 491
			-
				-
					This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 492
			-
				-
					Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 493
			-
				-
					Giver of all things fair! but fairest this
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 494
			-
				-
					Of all thy gifts! nor enviest. I now see
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 495
			-
				-
					Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 496
			-
				-
					Before me: Woman is her name; of Man
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 497
			-
				-
					Extracted: for this cause he shall forego
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 498
			-
				-
					Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 499
			-
				-
					And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 500
			-
				-
					She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 501
			-
				-
					Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 502
			-
				-
					Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 503
			-
				-
					That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 504
			-
				-
					Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 505
			-
				-
					The more desirable; or, to say all,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 506
			-
				-
					Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 507
			-
				-
					Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 508
			-
				-
					I followed her; she what was honour knew,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 509
			-
				-
					And with obsequious majesty approved
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 510

					My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 511
			-
				-
					I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 512
			-
				-
					And happy constellations, on that hour
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 513
			-
				-
					Shed their selectest influence; the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 514
			-
				-
					Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 515
			-
				-
					Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 516
			-
				-
					Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 517
			-
				-
					Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 518
			-
				-
					Disporting, till the amorous bird of night
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 519
			-
				-
					Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 520
			-
				-
					On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 521
			-
				-
					Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 522
			-
				-
					My story to the sum of earthly bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 523
			-
				-
					Which I enjoy; and must confess to find
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 524
			-
				-
					In all things else delight indeed, but such
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 525
			-
				-
					As, used or not, works in the mind no change,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 526
			-
				-
					Nor vehement desire; these delicacies
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 527
			-
				-
					I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 528
			-
				-
					Walks, and the melody of birds: but here
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 529
			-
				-
					Far otherwise, transported I behold,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 530
			-
				-
					Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 531
			-
				-
					Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 532
			-
				-
					Superiour and unmoved; here only weak
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 533
			-
				-
					Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 534
			-

					Or Nature failed in me, and left some part
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 535
			-
				-
					Not proof enough such object to sustain;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 536
			-
				-
					Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 537
			-
				-
					More than enough; at least on her bestowed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 538
			-
				-
					Too much of ornament, in outward show
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 539
			-
				-
					Elaborate, of inward less exact.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 540
			-
				-
					For well I understand in the prime end
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 541
			-
				-
					Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 542

					And inward faculties, which most excel;
				-

			-
				-
					O'er other creatures: Yet when I approach
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 547
			-
				-
					Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 548
			-
				-
					And in herself complete, so well to know
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 549
			-
				-
					Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 550
			-
				-
					Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 551
			-
				-
					All higher knowledge in her presence falls
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 552
			-
				-
					Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 553
			-
				-
					Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 554
			-
				-
					Authority and Reason on her wait,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 555
			-
				-
					As one intended first, not after made

			-
				Book 8: Line 556
			-

					Occasionally; and, to consummate all,

				Book 8: Line 557
			-
				-
					Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 558
			-

					Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 559
			-

					About her, as a guard angelick placed.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 560

					To whom the Angel with contracted brow.

					Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;

				Book 8: Line 562
			-
				-
					Do thou but thine; and be not diffident
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 563
			-
				-
					Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 564
			-
				-
					Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 565
			-
				-
					By attributing overmuch to things
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 566
			-
				-
					Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 567
			-
				-
					For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 568
			-
				-
					An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 569
			-
				-
					Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 570
			-
				-
					Not thy subjection: Weigh with her thyself;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 571
			-
				-
					Then value: Oft-times nothing profits more
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 572
			-
				-
					Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 573
			-
				-
					Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 574
			-
				-
					The more she will acknowledge thee her head,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 575
			-
				-
					And to realities yield all her shows:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 576
			-
				-
					Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 577
			-
				-
					So awful, that with honour thou mayest love
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 578
			-
				-
					Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 579
			-
				-
					But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 580
			-
				-
					Is propagated, seem such dear delight
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 581
			-
				-
					Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 582
			-
				-
					To cattle and each beast; which would not be
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 583
			-
				-
					To them made common and divulged, if aught
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 584

			-
				Book 8: Line 586
			-

					What higher in her society thou findest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 587
			-
				-
					Attractive, human, rational, love still;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 588
			-
				-
					In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 589
			-

					Wherein true love consists not: Love refines
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 590

					The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 591
			-
				-
					In reason, and is judicious; is the scale
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 592
			-
				-
					By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 593
			-
				-
					Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 594
			-
				-
					Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 595

					To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.

				Book 8: Line 596

					Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught

				Book 8: Line 597

				-
					In procreation common to all kinds,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 598
			-
				-
					(Though higher of the genial bed by far,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 599
			-
				-
					And with mysterious reverence I deem,)
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 600
			-
				-
					So much delights me, as those graceful acts,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 601
			-
				-
					Those thousand decencies, that daily flow
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 602
			-
				-
					From all her words and actions mixed with love
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 603
			-
				-
					And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 604
			-
				-
					Union of mind, or in us both one soul;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 605
			-
				-
					Harmony to behold in wedded pair
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 606
			-
				-
					More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 607
			-
				-
					Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 608
			-
				-
					What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 609

					Who meet with various objects, from the sense

				Book 8: Line 610
			-
				-
					Variously representing; yet, still free,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 611
			-
				-
					Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 612

					To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 613
			-
				-
					Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 614
			-
				-
					Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 615
			-
				-
					Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 616
			-
				-
					Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 617
			-
				-
					Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 618
			-
				-
					To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 619
			-
				-
					Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 620
			-
				-
					Answered. Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 621
			-
				-
					Us happy, and without love no happiness.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 622

					Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,

			-
				Book 8: Line 623
			-
				-
					(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 624
			-

					In eminence; and obstacle find none

				Book 8: Line 625
			-
				-
					Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 626

					Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,

					Total they mix, union of pure with pure

				Book 8: Line 628
			-
				-
					Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 629
			-
				-
					As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 630

				-
					But I can now no more; the parting sun
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 631
			-
				-
					Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 632
			-
				-
					Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 633
			-
				-
					Be strong, live happy, and love! But, first of all,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 634
			-
				-
					Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 635
			-
				-
					His great command; take heed lest passion sway
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 636
			-
				-
					Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 637
			-
				-
					Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 638
			-
				-
					The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 639
			-
				-
					I in thy persevering shall rejoice,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 640
			-
				-
					And all the Blest: Stand fast; to stand or fall
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 641
			-
				-
					Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 642
			-
				-
					Perfect within, no outward aid require;
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 643
			-
				-
					And all temptation to transgress repel.
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 644
			-
				-
					So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 645
			-
				-
					Followed with benediction. Since to part,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 646
			-
				-
					Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 647
			-
				-
					Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 648
			-
				-
					Gentle to me and affable hath been
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 649
			-
				-
					Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 650
			-
				-
					With grateful memory: Thou to mankind
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 651
			-
				-
					Be good and friendly still, and oft return!
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 652
			-
				-
					So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 8: Line 653
			-
				-
					From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.

					No more of talk where God or Angel guest

					With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 3

					Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change

				Book 9: Line 6

					Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach

			-
				Book 9: Line 7
			-
				-
					Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,

				-
					Now alienated, distance and distaste,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 10
			-
				-
					Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 11

					Death's harbinger: Sad task! yet argument
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 14

					Not less but more heroick than the wrath

				Book 9: Line 15
			-
				-
					Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 16
			-

			-
				Book 9: Line 20

					If answerable style I can obtain
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 21
			-
				-
					Of my celestial patroness, who deigns

			-
				Book 9: Line 22
			-
				-
					Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,

					Easy my unpremeditated verse:

				Book 9: Line 25
			-

					Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,

				Book 9: Line 93

				Book 9: Line 111

					If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange

			-
				-
					Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,

			-
				Book 9: Line 118
			-

					Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 119
			-
				-
					Find place or refuge; and the more I see
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 120

					Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 121

				Book 9: Line 125

				Book 9: Line 127

				-
					By what I seek, but others to make such
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 128
			-
				-
					As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 129
			-
				-
					For only in destroying I find ease
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 130
			-
				-
					To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,
				-

				Book 9: Line 131
			-
				-
					Or won to what may work his utter loss,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 132
			-

					For whom all this was made, all this will soon

				Book 9: Line 134

					In woe then; that destruction wide may range:

				Book 9: Line 135

				Book 9: Line 137
			-
				-
					What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 138
			-

					Continued making; and who knows how long
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 139
			-
				-
					Before had been contriving? though perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 140
			-
				-
					Not longer than since I, in one night, freed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 141
			-

					From servitude inglorious well nigh half

				Book 9: Line 142

					The angelick name, and thinner left the throng

				Book 9: Line 143
			-
				-
					Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 144
			-
				-
					And to repair his numbers thus impaired,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 145
			-
				-
					Whether such virtue spent of old now failed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 146
			-
				-
					More Angels to create, if they at least
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 147
			-
				-
					Are his created, or, to spite us more,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 148
			-
				-
					Determined to advance into our room
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 149
			-
				-
					A creature formed of earth, and him endow,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 150
			-
				-
					Exalted from so base original,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 151
			-
				-
					With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 152
			-
				-
					He effected; Man he made, and for him built
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 153
			-
				-
					Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 154
			-
				-
					Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 155
			-
				-
					Subjected to his service angel-wings,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 156
			-
				-
					And flaming ministers to watch and tend
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 157
			-
				-
					Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 158
			-
				-
					I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 159
			-
				-
					Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 160
			-
				-
					In every bush and brake, where hap may find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 161
			-
				-
					The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 162
			-
				-
					To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 163
			-
				-
					O foul descent! that I, who erst contended
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 164
			-
				-
					With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 165
			-
				-
					Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 166
			-
				-
					This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 167
			-
				-
					That to the highth of Deity aspired!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 168
			-
				-
					But what will not ambition and revenge
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 169
			-
				-
					Descend to? Who aspires, must down as low
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 170
			-
				-
					As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 171
			-
				-
					To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 172
			-
				-
					Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 173
			-
				-
					Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 174
			-
				-
					Since higher I fall short, on him who next
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 175
			-
				-
					Provokes my envy, this new favourite
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 176
			-
				-
					Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 177
			-
				-
					Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 178
			-
				-
					From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 179
			-
				-
					So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 180
			-
				-
					Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 181
			-
				-
					His midnight-search, where soonest he might find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 182
			-
				-
					The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 183
			-
				-
					In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 184
			-
				-
					His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 185
			-
				-
					Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 186
			-
				-
					Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 187
			-
				-
					Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 188
			-
				-
					The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 189
			-
				-
					In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 190
			-
				-
					With act intelligential; but his sleep
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 191
			-
				-
					Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 192
			-
				-
					Now, when as sacred light began to dawn
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 193
			-
				-
					In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 194
			-
				-
					Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 195
			-
				-
					From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 196
			-
				-
					To the Creator, and his nostrils fill
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 197
			-
				-
					With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 198
			-
				-
					And joined their vocal worship to the quire
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 199
			-
				-
					Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 200
			-
				-
					The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 201
			-
				-
					Then commune, how that day they best may ply
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 202
			-
				-
					Their growing work: for much their work out-grew
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 203
			-
				-
					The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 204
			-
				-
					And Eve first to her husband thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 205
			-
				-
					Adam, well may we labour still to dress
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 206
			-
				-
					This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 207
			-
				-
					Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 208
			-
				-
					Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 209
			-
				-
					Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 210
			-
				-
					Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 211
			-
				-
					One night or two with wanton growth derides
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 212
			-
				-
					Tending to wild. Thou therefore now advise,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 213
			-
				-
					Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 214
			-
				-
					Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 215
			-
				-
					Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 216
			-
				-
					The woodbine round this arbour, or direct
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 217
			-
				-
					The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 218
			-
				-
					In yonder spring of roses intermixed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 219
			-
				-
					With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 220
			-
				-
					For, while so near each other thus all day
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 221
			-
				-
					Our task we choose, what wonder if so near
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 222
			-
				-
					Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 223
			-
				-
					Casual discourse draw on; which intermits
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 224
			-
				-
					Our day's work, brought to little, though begun
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 225
			-
				-
					Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 226
			-
				-
					To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 227
			-
				-
					Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 228
			-
				-
					Compare above all living creatures dear!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 229
			-
				-
					Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 230
			-
				-
					How we might best fulfil the work which here
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 231
			-
				-
					God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 232
			-
				-
					Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 233
			-
				-
					In woman, than to study houshold good,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 234
			-
				-
					And good works in her husband to promote.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 235
			-
				-
					Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 236
			-
				-
					Labour, as to debar us when we need
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 237
			-
				-
					Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 238
			-
				-
					Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 239
			-
				-
					Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 240
			-
				-
					To brute denied, and are of love the food;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 241
			-
				-
					Love, not the lowest end of human life.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 242
			-
				-
					For not to irksome toil, but to delight,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 243
			-
				-
					He made us, and delight to reason joined.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 244
			-
				-
					These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 245
			-
				-
					Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 246
			-
				-
					As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 247
			-
				-
					Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 248
			-
				-
					Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 249
			-
				-
					For solitude sometimes is best society,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 250
			-
				-
					And short retirement urges sweet return.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 251
			-
				-
					But other doubt possesses me, lest harm
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 252
			-
				-
					Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 253
			-
				-
					What hath been warned us, what malicious foe
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 254
			-
				-
					Envying our happiness, and of his own
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 255
			-
				-
					Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 256
			-
				-
					By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 257
			-
				-
					Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 258
			-
				-
					His wish and best advantage, us asunder;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 259
			-
				-
					Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 260
			-
				-
					To other speedy aid might lend at need:

			-
				Book 9: Line 261

					Whether his first design be to withdraw
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 262
			-
				-
					Our fealty from God, or to disturb
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 263
			-
				-
					Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 264
			-
				-
					Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 265
			-
				-
					Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 266
			-
				-
					That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 267
			-
				-
					The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 268
			-
				-
					Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 269
			-
				-
					Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 270
			-
				-
					To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 271
			-
				-
					As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 272
			-
				-
					With sweet austere composure thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 273
			-
				-
					Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 274
			-
				-
					That such an enemy we have, who seeks
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 275
			-
				-
					Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 276
			-
				-
					And from the parting Angel over-heard,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 277
			-
				-
					As in a shady nook I stood behind,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 278
			-
				-
					Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 279
			-
				-
					But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 280
			-
				-
					To God or thee, because we have a foe
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 281
			-
				-
					May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 282
			-
				-
					His violence thou fearest not, being such
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 283
			-
				-
					As we, not capable of death or pain,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 284
			-
				-
					Can either not receive, or can repel.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 285
			-
				-
					His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 286
			-
				-
					Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 287
			-
				-
					Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 288
			-
				-
					Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 289
			-
				-
					Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 290
			-
				-
					To whom with healing words Adam replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 291
			-
				-
					Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 292
			-
				-
					For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 293
			-
				-
					Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 294
			-
				-
					Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 295
			-
				-
					The attempt itself, intended by our foe.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 296
			-
				-
					For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 297
			-
				-
					The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 298
			-
				-
					Not incorruptible of faith, not proof
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 299
			-
				-
					Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 300
			-
				-
					And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 301
			-
				-
					Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 302
			-
				-
					If such affront I labour to avert
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 303
			-
				-
					From thee alone, which on us both at once
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 304
			-
				-
					The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 305
			-
				-
					Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 306
			-
				-
					Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 307
			-
				-
					Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 308
			-
				-
					Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 309
			-
				-
					I, from the influence of thy looks, receive
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 310
			-
				-
					Access in every virtue; in thy sight
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 311
			-
				-
					More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 312
			-
				-
					Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 313
			-
				-
					Shame to be overcome or over-reached,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 314
			-
				-
					Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 315
			-
				-
					Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 316
			-
				-
					When I am present, and thy trial choose
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 317
			-
				-
					With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 318
			-
				-
					So spake domestick Adam in his care
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 319
			-
				-
					And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 320
			-
				-
					Less attributed to her faith sincere,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 321
			-
				-
					Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 322
			-
				-
					If this be our condition, thus to dwell
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 323
			-
				-
					In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 324
			-
				-
					Subtle or violent, we not endued
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 325
			-
				-
					Single with like defence, wherever met;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 326
			-
				-
					How are we happy, still in fear of harm?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 327
			-
				-
					But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 328
			-
				-
					Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 329
			-
				-
					Of our integrity: his foul esteem
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 330
			-
				-
					Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 331
			-
				-
					Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 332
			-
				-
					By us? who rather double honour gain
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 333
			-
				-
					From his surmise proved false; find peace within,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 334
			-
				-
					Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 335
			-
				-
					And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 336
			-
				-
					Alone, without exteriour help sustained?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 337
			-
				-
					Let us not then suspect our happy state
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 338
			-
				-
					Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 339
			-
				-
					As not secure to single or combined.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 340
			-
				-
					Frail is our happiness, if this be so,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 341
			-
				-
					And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 342
			-
				-
					To whom thus Adam fervently replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 343
			-
				-
					O Woman, best are all things as the will
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 344
			-
				-
					Of God ordained them: His creating hand
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 345
			-
				-
					Nothing imperfect or deficient left
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 346
			-
				-
					Of all that he created, much less Man,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 347
			-
				-
					Or aught that might his happy state secure,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 348
			-
				-
					Secure from outward force; within himself
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 349
			-
				-
					The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 350
			-
				-
					Against his will he can receive no harm.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 351
			-
				-
					But God left free the will; for what obeys
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 352
			-
				-
					Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 353
			-
				-
					But bid her well be ware, and still erect;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 354
			-
				-
					Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 355
			-
				-
					She dictate false; and mis-inform the will
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 356
			-
				-
					To do what God expressly hath forbid.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 357
			-
				-
					Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 358
			-
				-
					That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 359
			-
				-
					Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 360
			-
				-
					Since Reason not impossibly may meet
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 361
			-
				-
					Some specious object by the foe suborned,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 362
			-
				-
					And fall into deception unaware,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 363
			-
				-
					Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 364
			-
				-
					Seek not temptation then, which to avoid
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 365
			-
				-
					Were better, and most likely if from me
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 366
			-
				-
					Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 367
			-
				-
					Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 368
			-
				-
					First thy obedience; the other who can know,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 369
			-
				-
					Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 370
			-
				-
					But, if thou think, trial unsought may find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 371
			-
				-
					Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 372
			-
				-
					Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 373
			-
				-
					Go in thy native innocence, rely
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 374
			-
				-
					On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 375
			-
				-
					For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 376
			-
				-
					So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 377
			-
				-
					Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 378
			-
				-
					With thy permission then, and thus forewarned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 379
			-
				-
					Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 380
			-
				-
					Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 381
			-
				-
					May find us both perhaps far less prepared,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 382
			-
				-
					The willinger I go, nor much expect
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 383
			-
				-
					A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 384
			-
				-
					So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 385
			-
				-
					Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 386
			-
				-
					Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 387
			-
				-
					Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 388
			-
				-
					Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 389
			-
				-
					In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 390
			-
				-
					Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 391
			-
				-
					But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 392
			-
				-
					Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 393
			-
				-
					To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 394
			-
				-
					Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 395
			-
				-
					Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 396
			-
				-
					Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 397
			-
				-
					Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 398
			-
				-
					Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 399
			-
				-
					Oft he to her his charge of quick return
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 400
			-
				-
					Repeated; she to him as oft engaged
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 401
			-
				-
					To be returned by noon amid the bower,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 402
			-
				-
					And all things in best order to invite
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 403
			-
				-
					Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 404
			-
				-
					O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 405
			-
				-
					Of thy presumed return! event perverse!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 406
			-
				-
					Thou never from that hour in Paradise
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 407
			-
				-
					Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 408
			-
				-
					Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 409
			-
				-
					Waited with hellish rancour imminent
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 410
			-
				-
					To intercept thy way, or send thee back
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 411
			-
				-
					Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 412
			-
				-
					For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 413
			-
				-
					Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 414
			-
				-
					And on his quest, where likeliest he might find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 415
			-
				-
					The only two of mankind, but in them
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 416
			-
				-
					The whole included race, his purposed prey.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 417
			-
				-
					In bower and field he sought, where any tuft
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 418
			-
				-
					Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 419
			-
				-
					Their tendance, or plantation for delight;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 420
			-
				-
					By fountain or by shady rivulet
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 421
			-
				-
					He sought them both, but wished his hap might find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 422
			-
				-
					Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 423
			-
				-
					Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 424
			-
				-
					Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 425
			-
				-
					Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 426
			-
				-
					Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 427
			-
				-
					About her glowed, oft stooping to support
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 428
			-
				-
					Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 429
			-
				-
					Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 430
			-
				-
					Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 431
			-
				-
					Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 432
			-
				-
					Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 433
			-
				-
					From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 434
			-
				-
					Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 435
			-
				-
					Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 436
			-
				-
					Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 437
			-
				-
					Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 438
			-
				-
					Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 439
			-
				-
					Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 440
			-
				-
					Or of revived Adonis, or renowned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 441
			-
				-
					Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 442
			-
				-
					Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 443
			-
				-
					Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 444
			-
				-
					Much he the place admired, the person more.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 445
			-
				-
					As one who long in populous city pent,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 446
			-
				-
					Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 447
			-
				-
					Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 448
			-
				-
					Among the pleasant villages and farms
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 449
			-
				-
					Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 450
			-
				-
					The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 451
			-
				-
					Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 452
			-
				-
					If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 453
			-
				-
					What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 454
			-
				-
					She most, and in her look sums all delight:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 455
			-
				-
					Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 456
			-
				-
					This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 457
			-
				-
					Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 458
			-
				-
					Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 459
			-
				-
					Her graceful innocence, her every air
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 460
			-
				-
					Of gesture, or least action, overawed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 461
			-
				-
					His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 462

				-
					His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 463
			-
				-
					That space the Evil-one abstracted stood
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 464
			-
				-
					From his own evil, and for the time remained
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 465
			-
				-
					Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 466
			-
				-
					Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 467
			-
				-
					But the hot Hell that always in him burns,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 468
			-
				-
					Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 469
			-
				-
					And tortures him now more, the more he sees
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 470
			-
				-
					Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 471
			-
				-
					Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 472
			-
				-
					Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 473
			-
				-
					Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 474
			-
				-
					Compulsion thus transported, to forget
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 475
			-
				-
					What hither brought us! hate, not love; nor hope
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 476
			-
				-
					Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 477
			-
				-
					Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 478
			-
				-
					Save what is in destroying; other joy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 479
			-
				-
					To me is lost. Then, let me not let pass
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 480
			-
				-
					Occasion which now smiles; behold alone
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 481
			-
				-
					The woman, opportune to all attempts,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 482
			-
				-
					Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 483
			-
				-
					Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 484
			-
				-
					And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 485
			-
				-
					Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 486
			-
				-
					Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 487
			-
				-
					I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 488
			-
				-
					Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 489
			-
				-
					She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 490
			-
				-
					Not terrible, though terrour be in love
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 491
			-
				-
					And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 492
			-
				-
					Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 493
			-
				-
					The way which to her ruin now I tend.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 494
			-
				-
					So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 495
			-
				-
					In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 496
			-
				-
					Addressed his way: not with indented wave,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 497
			-
				-
					Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 498
			-
				-
					Circular base of rising folds, that towered
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 499
			-
				-
					Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 500
			-
				-
					Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 501
			-
				-
					With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 502
			-
				-
					Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 503
			-
				-
					Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 504
			-
				-
					And lovely; never since of serpent-kind
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 505
			-
				-
					Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 506
			-
				-
					Hermione and Cadmus, or the god
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 507
			-
				-
					In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 508
			-
				-
					Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 509
			-
				-
					He with Olympias; this with her who bore
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 510
			-
				-
					Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 511
			-
				-
					At first, as one who sought access, but feared
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 512
			-
				-
					To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 513
			-
				-
					As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 514
			-
				-
					Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 515
			-
				-
					Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 516
			-
				-
					So varied he, and of his tortuous train
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 517
			-
				-
					Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 518
			-
				-
					To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 519
			-
				-
					Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 520
			-
				-
					To such disport before her through the field,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 521
			-
				-
					From every beast; more duteous at her call,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 522
			-
				-
					Than at Circean call the herd disguised.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 523
			-
				-
					He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 524
			-
				-
					But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 525
			-
				-
					His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 526
			-
				-
					Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 527
			-
				-
					His gentle dumb expression turned at length
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 528
			-
				-
					The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 529
			-
				-
					Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 530
			-
				-
					Organick, or impulse of vocal air,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 531
			-
				-
					His fraudulent temptation thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 532
			-
				-
					Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 533
			-
				-
					Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 534
			-
				-
					Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 535
			-
				-
					Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 536
			-
				-
					Insatiate; I thus single; nor have feared
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 537
			-
				-
					Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 538
			-
				-
					Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 539
			-
				-
					Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 540
			-
				-
					By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 541
			-
				-
					With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 542
			-
				-
					Where universally admired; but here
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 543
			-
				-
					In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 544
			-
				-
					Beholders rude, and shallow to discern
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 545
			-
				-
					Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 546
			-
				-
					Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 547
			-
				-
					A Goddess among Gods, adored and served
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 548
			-
				-
					By Angels numberless, thy daily train.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 549
			-
				-
					So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 550
			-
				-
					Into the heart of Eve his words made way,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 551
			-
				-
					Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 552
			-
				-
					Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 553
			-
				-
					What may this mean? language of man pronounced
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 554
			-
				-
					By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 555
			-
				-
					The first, at least, of these I thought denied
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 556
			-
				-
					To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 557
			-
				-
					Created mute to all articulate sound:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 558
			-
				-
					The latter I demur; for in their looks
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 559
			-
				-
					Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 560
			-
				-
					Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 561
			-
				-
					I knew, but not with human voice endued;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 562
			-
				-
					Redouble then this miracle, and say,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 563
			-
				-
					How camest thou speakable of mute, and how
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 564
			-
				-
					To me so friendly grown above the rest
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 565
			-
				-
					Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 566
			-
				-
					Say, for such wonder claims attention due.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 567
			-
				-
					To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 568
			-
				-
					Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 569
			-
				-
					Easy to me it is to tell thee all
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 570
			-
				-
					What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 571
			-
				-
					I was at first as other beasts that graze
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 572
			-
				-
					The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 573
			-
				-
					As was my food; nor aught but food discerned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 574
			-
				-
					Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 575
			-
				-
					Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 576
			-
				-
					A goodly tree far distant to behold
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 577
			-
				-
					Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 578
			-
				-
					Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 579
			-
				-
					When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 580
			-
				-
					Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 581
			-
				-
					Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 582
			-
				-
					Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 583
			-
				-
					Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 584
			-
				-
					To satisfy the sharp desire I had
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 585
			-
				-
					Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 586
			-
				-
					Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 587
			-
				-
					Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 588
			-
				-
					Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 589
			-
				-
					About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 590
			-
				-
					For, high from ground, the branches would require
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 591
			-
				-
					Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 592
			-
				-
					All other beasts that saw, with like desire
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 593
			-
				-
					Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 594
			-
				-
					Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 595
			-
				-
					Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 596
			-
				-
					I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 597
			-
				-
					At feed or fountain, never had I found.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 598
			-
				-
					Sated at length, ere long I might perceive
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 599
			-
				-
					Strange alteration in me, to degree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 600
			-
				-
					Of reason in my inward powers; and speech
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 601
			-
				-
					Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 602
			-
				-
					Thenceforth to speculations high or deep
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 603
			-
				-
					I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 604
			-
				-
					Considered all things visible in Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 605
			-
				-
					Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 606
			-
				-
					But all that fair and good in thy divine
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 607
			-
				-
					Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 608
			-
				-
					United I beheld; no fair to thine
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 609
			-
				-
					Equivalent or second! which compelled
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 610
			-
				-
					Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 611
			-
				-
					And gaze, and worship thee of right declared
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 612
			-
				-
					Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 613
			-
				-
					So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 614
			-
				-
					Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 615
			-
				-
					Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 616
			-
				-
					The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 617
			-
				-
					But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 618
			-
				-
					For many are the trees of God that grow
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 619
			-
				-
					In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 620
			-
				-
					To us; in such abundance lies our choice,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 621
			-
				-
					As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 622
			-
				-
					Still hanging incorruptible, till men
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 623
			-
				-
					Grow up to their provision, and more hands
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 624
			-
				-
					Help to disburden Nature of her birth.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 625
			-
				-
					To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 626
			-
				-
					Empress, the way is ready, and not long;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 627
			-
				-
					Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 628
			-
				-
					Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 629
			-
				-
					Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 630
			-
				-
					My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 631
			-
				-
					Lead then, said Eve. He, leading, swiftly rolled
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 632
			-
				-
					In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 633
			-
				-
					To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 634
			-
				-
					Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 635
			-
				-
					Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 636
			-
				-
					Condenses, and the cold environs round,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 637
			-
				-
					Kindled through agitation to a flame,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 638
			-
				-
					Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 639
			-
				-
					Hovering and blazing with delusive light,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 640
			-
				-
					Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 641
			-
				-
					To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 642
			-
				-
					There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 643
			-
				-
					So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 644
			-
				-
					Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 645
			-
				-
					Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 646
			-
				-
					Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 647
			-
				-
					Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 648
			-
				-
					Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 649
			-
				-
					The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 650
			-
				-
					Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 651
			-
				-
					But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 652
			-
				-
					God so commanded, and left that command
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 653
			-
				-
					Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 654
			-
				-
					Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 655
			-
				-
					To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 656
			-
				-
					Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 657
			-
				-
					Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 658
			-
				-
					Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 659
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve, yet sinless. Of the fruit
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 660
			-
				-
					Of each tree in the garden we may eat;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 661
			-
				-
					But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
				-

					The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat

			-

					Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

					She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold

				Book 9: Line 665
			-
				-
					The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 666
			-
				-
					To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 667
			-

				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 668
			-
				-
					Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 669
			-
				-
					Raised, as of some great matter to begin.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 670
			-
				-
					As when of old some orator renowned,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 671
			-
				-
					In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 672
			-
				-
					Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 673
			-
				-
					Stood in himself collected; while each part,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 674
			-
				-
					Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 675
			-
				-
					Sometimes in highth began, as no delay
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 676
			-
				-
					Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 677
			-
				-
					So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 678
			-
				-
					The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 679
			-
				-
					O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 680
			-
				-
					Mother of science! now I feel thy power
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 681
			-
				-
					Within me clear; not only to discern
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 682
			-
				-
					Things in their causes, but to trace the ways
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 683
			-
				-
					Of highest agents, deemed however wise.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 684
			-
				-
					Queen of this universe! do not believe
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 685
			-
				-
					Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 686
			-
				-
					How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 687
			-
				-
					To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 688
			-
				-
					Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 689
			-
				-
					And life more perfect have attained than Fate
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 690
			-
				-
					Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 691
			-
				-
					Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 692
			-
				-
					Is open? or will God incense his ire
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 693
			-
				-
					For such a petty trespass? and not praise
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 694
			-
				-
					Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 695
			-
				-
					Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 696
			-
				-
					Deterred not from achieving what might lead
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 697
			-
				-
					To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 698
			-
				-
					Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 699
			-
				-
					Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 700
			-
				-
					God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 701
			-
				-
					Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 702
			-
				-
					Your fear itself of death removes the fear.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 703
			-
				-
					Why then was this forbid? Why, but to awe;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 704
			-
				-
					Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 705
			-
				-
					His worshippers? He knows that in the day
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 706
			-
				-
					Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 707
			-
				-
					Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 708
			-
				-
					Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 709
			-
				-
					Knowing both good and evil, as they know.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 710
			-
				-
					That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 711
			-
				-
					Internal Man, is but proportion meet;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 712
			-
				-
					I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 713
			-
				-
					So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 714
			-
				-
					Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 715
			-
				-
					Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 716
			-
				-
					And what are Gods, that Man may not become
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 717
			-
				-
					As they, participating God-like food?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 718
			-
				-
					The Gods are first, and that advantage use
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 719
			-
				-
					On our belief, that all from them proceeds:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 720
			-
				-
					I question it; for this fair earth I see,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 721
			-
				-
					Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 722
			-
				-
					Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 723
			-
				-
					Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 724
			-
				-
					That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 725
			-
				-
					Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 726
			-
				-
					The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 727
			-
				-
					What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 728
			-
				-
					Impart against his will, if all be his?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 729
			-
				-
					Or is it envy? and can envy dwell
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 730
			-
				-
					In heavenly breasts? These, these, and many more
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 731
			-
				-
					Causes import your need of this fair fruit.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 732
			-
				-
					Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 733
			-
				-
					He ended; and his words, replete with guile,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 734
			-
				-
					Into her heart too easy entrance won:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 735
			-
				-
					Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 736
			-
				-
					Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 737
			-
				-
					Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 738
			-
				-
					With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 739
			-
				-
					Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 740
			-
				-
					An eager appetite, raised by the smell
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 741
			-
				-
					So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 742
			-
				-
					Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 743
			-
				-
					Solicited her longing eye; yet first
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 744
			-
				-
					Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 745
			-
				-
					Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 746
			-
				-
					Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 747
			-
				-
					Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 748
			-
				-
					Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 749
			-
				-
					The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 750
			-
				-
					Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 751
			-
				-
					Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 752
			-
				-
					Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 753
			-
				-
					Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 754
			-
				-
					Commends thee more, while it infers the good
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 755
			-
				-
					By thee communicated, and our want:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 756
			-
				-
					For good unknown sure is not had; or, had
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 757
			-
				-
					And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 758
			-
				-
					In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 759
			-
				-
					Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 760
			-
				-
					Such prohibitions bind not. But, if death
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 761
			-
				-
					Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 762
			-
				-
					Our inward freedom? In the day we eat
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 763
			-
				-
					Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 764
			-
				-
					How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 765
			-
				-
					And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 766
			-
				-
					Irrational till then. For us alone
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 767
			-
				-
					Was death invented? or to us denied
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 768
			-
				-
					This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 769
			-
				-
					For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 770
			-
				-
					Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 771
			-
				-
					The good befallen him, author unsuspect,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 772
			-
				-
					Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 773
			-
				-
					What fear I then? rather, what know to fear
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 774
			-
				-
					Under this ignorance of good and evil,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 775
			-
				-
					Of God or death, of law or penalty?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 776
			-
				-
					Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 777
			-
				-
					Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 778
			-
				-
					Of virtue to make wise: What hinders then
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 779
			-
				-
					To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 780
			-
				-
					So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 781
			-
				-
					Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 782
			-
				-
					Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 783
			-
				-
					Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 784
			-
				-
					That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 785
			-
				-
					The guilty Serpent; and well might; for Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 786
			-
				-
					Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 787
			-
				-
					Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 788
			-
				-
					In fruit she never tasted, whether true
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 789
			-
				-
					Or fancied so, through expectation high
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 790
			-
				-
					Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 791
			-
				-
					Greedily she ingorged without restraint,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 792
			-
				-
					And knew not eating death: Satiate at length,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 793
			-
				-
					And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 794
			-
				-
					Thus to herself she pleasingly began.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 795
			-
				-
					O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 796
			-
				-
					In Paradise! of operation blest
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 797
			-
				-
					To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 798
			-
				-
					And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 799
			-
				-
					Created; but henceforth my early care,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 800
			-
				-
					Not without song, each morning, and due praise,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 801
			-
				-
					Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 802
			-
				-
					Of thy full branches offered free to all;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 803
			-
				-
					Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 804
			-
				-
					In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 805
			-
				-
					Though others envy what they cannot give:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 806
			-
				-
					For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 807
			-
				-
					Thus grown. Experience, next, to thee I owe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 808
			-
				-
					Best guide; not following thee, I had remained
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 809
			-
				-
					In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 810
			-
				-
					And givest access, though secret she retire.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 811
			-
				-
					And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 812
			-
				-
					High, and remote to see from thence distinct
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 813
			-
				-
					Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 814
			-
				-
					May have diverted from continual watch
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 815
			-
				-
					Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 816
			-
				-
					About him. But to Adam in what sort
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 817
			-
				-
					Shall I appear? shall I to him make known
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 818
			-
				-
					As yet my change, and give him to partake
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 819
			-
				-
					Full happiness with me, or rather not,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 820
			-
				-
					But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 821
			-
				-
					Without copartner? so to add what wants
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 822
			-
				-
					In female sex, the more to draw his love,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 823
			-
				-
					And render me more equal; and perhaps,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 824
			-
				-
					A thing not undesirable, sometime
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 825
			-
				-
					Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 826
			-
				-
					This may be well: But what if God have seen,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 827
			-
				-
					And death ensue? then I shall be no more!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 828
			-
				-
					And Adam, wedded to another Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 829
			-
				-
					Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 830
			-
				-
					A death to think! Confirmed then I resolve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 831
			-
				-
					Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 832
			-
				-
					So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 833
			-
				-
					I could endure, without him live no life.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 834
			-
				-
					So saying, from the tree her step she turned;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 835
			-
				-
					But first low reverence done, as to the Power
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 836
			-
				-
					That dwelt within, whose presence had infused
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 837
			-
				-
					Into the plant sciential sap, derived
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 838
			-
				-
					From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 839
			-
				-
					Waiting desirous her return, had wove
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 840
			-
				-
					Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 841
			-
				-
					Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 842
			-
				-
					As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 843
			-
				-
					Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 844
			-
				-
					Solace in her return, so long delayed:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 845
			-
				-
					Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 846
			-
				-
					Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 847
			-
				-
					And forth to meet her went, the way she took
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 848
			-
				-
					That morn when first they parted: by the tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 849
			-
				-
					Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 850
			-
				-
					Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 851
			-
				-
					A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 852
			-
				-
					New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 853
			-
				-
					To him she hasted; in her face excuse
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 854
			-
				-
					Came prologue, and apology too prompt;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 855
			-
				-
					Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 856
			-
				-
					Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 857
			-
				-
					Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 858
			-
				-
					Thy presence; agony of love till now
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 859
			-
				-
					Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 860
			-
				-
					Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,
				-

				-
					The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 862
			-
				-
					Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 863
			-
				-
					This tree is not, as we are told, a tree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 864
			-
				-
					Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 865
			-
				-
					Opening the way, but of divine effect
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 866
			-
				-
					To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 867
			-
				-
					And hath been tasted such: The serpent wise,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 868
			-
				-
					Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 869
			-
				-
					Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 870
			-
				-
					Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 871
			-
				-
					Endued with human voice and human sense,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 872
			-
				-
					Reasoning to admiration; and with me
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 873
			-
				-
					Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 874
			-
				-
					Have also tasted, and have also found
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 875
			-
				-
					The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 876
			-
				-
					Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 877
			-
				-
					And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 878
			-
				-
					Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 879
			-
				-
					For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 880
			-
				-
					Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 881
			-
				-
					Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 882
			-
				-
					May join us, equal joy, as equal love;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 883
			-
				-
					Lest, thou not tasting, different degree
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 884
			-
				-
					Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 885
			-
				-
					Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 886
			-
				-
					Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 887
			-
				-
					But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 888
			-
				-
					On the other side Adam, soon as he heard
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 889
			-
				-
					The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 890
			-
				-
					Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 891
			-
				-
					Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 892
			-
				-
					From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 893
			-
				-
					Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 894
			-
				-
					Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 895
			-
				-
					First to himself he inward silence broke.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 896
			-
				-
					O fairest of Creation, last and best
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 897
			-
				-
					Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 898
			-
				-
					Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 899
			-
				-
					Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 900
			-
				-
					How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 901
			-
				-
					Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 902
			-
				-
					Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 903
			-
				-
					The strict forbiddance, how to violate
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 904
			-
				-
					The sacred fruit forbidden! Some cursed fraud
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 905
			-
				-
					Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 906
			-
				-
					And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 907
			-
				-
					Certain my resolution is to die:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 908
			-
				-
					How can I live without thee! how forego
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 909
			-
				-
					Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 910
			-
				-
					To live again in these wild woods forlorn!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 911
			-
				-
					Should God create another Eve, and I
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 912
			-
				-
					Another rib afford, yet loss of thee
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 913
			-
				-
					Would never from my heart: no, no! I feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 914
			-
				-
					The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 915
			-
				-
					Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 916
			-
				-
					Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 917
			-
				-
					So having said, as one from sad dismay
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 918
			-
				-
					Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 919
			-
				-
					Submitting to what seemed remediless,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 920
			-
				-
					Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 921
			-
				-
					Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 922
			-
				-
					And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 923
			-
				-
					Had it been only coveting to eye
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 924
			-
				-
					That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 925
			-
				-
					Much more to taste it under ban to touch.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 926
			-
				-
					But past who can recall, or done undo?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 927
			-
				-
					Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 928
			-
				-
					Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 929
			-
				-
					Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 930
			-
				-
					Profaned first by the serpent, by him first
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 931
			-
				-
					Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 932
			-
				-
					Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 933
			-
				-
					Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 934
			-
				-
					Higher degree of life; inducement strong
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 935
			-
				-
					To us, as likely tasting to attain
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 936
			-
				-
					Proportional ascent; which cannot be
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 937
			-
				-
					But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 938
			-
				-
					Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 939
			-
				-
					Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 940
			-
				-
					Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 941
			-
				-
					Set over all his works; which in our fall,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 942
			-
				-
					For us created, needs with us must fail,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 943
			-
				-
					Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 944
			-
				-
					Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 945
			-
				-
					Not well conceived of God, who, though his power
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 946
			-
				-
					Creation could repeat, yet would be loth
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 947
			-
				-
					Us to abolish, lest the Adversary
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 948
			-
				-
					Triumph, and say; “Fickle their state whom God
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 949
			-
				-
					Most favours; who can please him long? Me first
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 950
			-
				-
					He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?”
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 951
			-
				-
					Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 952
			-
				-
					However I with thee have fixed my lot,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 953
			-
				-
					Certain to undergo like doom: If death
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 954
			-
				-
					Consort with thee, death is to me as life;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 955
			-
				-
					So forcible within my heart I feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 956
			-
				-
					The bond of Nature draw me to my own;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 957
			-
				-
					My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 958
			-
				-
					Our state cannot be severed; we are one,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 959
			-
				-
					One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 960
			-
				-
					So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 961
			-
				-
					O glorious trial of exceeding love,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 962
			-
				-
					Illustrious evidence, example high!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 963
			-
				-
					Engaging me to emulate; but, short
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 964
			-
				-
					Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 965
			-
				-
					Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 966
			-
				-
					And gladly of our union hear thee speak,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 967
			-
				-
					One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 968
			-
				-
					This day affords, declaring thee resolved,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 969
			-
				-
					Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 970
			-
				-
					Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 971
			-
				-
					To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 972
			-
				-
					If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 973
			-
				-
					Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 974
			-
				-
					Direct, or by occasion, hath presented
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 975
			-
				-
					This happy trial of thy love, which else
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 976
			-
				-
					So eminently never had been known?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 977
			-
				-
					Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 978
			-
				-
					This my attempt, I would sustain alone
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 979
			-
				-
					The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 980
			-
				-
					Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 981
			-
				-
					Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 982
			-
				-
					Remarkably so late of thy so true,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 983
			-
				-
					So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 984
			-
				-
					Far otherwise the event; not death, but life
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 985
			-
				-
					Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 986
			-
				-
					Taste so divine, that what of sweet before
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 987
			-
				-
					Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 988
			-
				-
					On my experience, Adam, freely taste,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 989
			-
				-
					And fear of death deliver to the winds.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 990
			-
				-
					So saying, she embraced him, and for joy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 991
			-
				-
					Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 992
			-
				-
					Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 993
			-
				-
					Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 994
			-
				-
					In recompence (for such compliance bad
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 995
			-
				-
					Such recompence best merits) from the bough
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 996
			-
				-
					She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 997
			-
				-
					With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 998
			-
				-
					Against his better knowledge; not deceived,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 999
			-
				-
					But fondly overcome with female charm.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1000
			-
				-
					Earth trembled from her entrails, as again
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1001
			-
				-
					In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1002
			-
				-
					Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1003
			-
				-
					Wept at completing of the mortal sin
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1004
			-
				-
					Original: while Adam took no thought,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1005
			-
				-
					Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1006
			-
				-
					Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1007
			-
				-
					Him with her loved society; that now,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1008
			-
				-
					As with new wine intoxicated both,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1009
			-
				-
					They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1010
			-
				-
					Divinity within them breeding wings,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1011
			-
				-
					Wherewith to scorn the earth: But that false fruit
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1012
			-
				-
					Far other operation first displayed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1013
			-
				-
					Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1014
			-
				-
					Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1015
			-
				-
					As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1016
			-
				-
					Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1017
			-
				-
					Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1018
			-
				-
					And elegant, of sapience no small part;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1019
			-
				-
					Since to each meaning savour we apply,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1020
			-
				-
					And palate call judicious; I the praise
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1021
			-
				-
					Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1022
			-
				-
					Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1023
			-
				-
					From this delightful fruit, nor known till now
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1024
			-
				-
					True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1025
			-
				-
					In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1026
			-
				-
					For this one tree had been forbidden ten.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1027
			-
				-
					But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1028
			-
				-
					As meet is, after such delicious fare;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1029
			-
				-
					For never did thy beauty, since the day
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1030
			-
				-
					I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1031
			-
				-
					With all perfections, so inflame my sense
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1032
			-
				-
					With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1033
			-
				-
					Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1034
			-
				-
					So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1035
			-
				-
					Of amorous intent; well understood
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1036
			-
				-
					Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1037
			-
				-
					Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1038
			-
				-
					Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1039
			-
				-
					He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1040
			-
				-
					Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1041
			-
				-
					And hyacinth; Earth's freshest softest lap.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1042
			-
				-
					There they their fill of love and love's disport
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1043
			-
				-
					Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1044
			-
				-
					The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1045
			-
				-
					Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1046
			-
				-
					Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1047
			-
				-
					That with exhilarating vapour bland
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1048
			-
				-
					About their spirits had played, and inmost powers
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1049
			-
				-
					Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1050
			-
				-
					Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1051
			-
				-
					Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1052
			-
				-
					As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1053
			-
				-
					Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1054
			-
				-
					How darkened; innocence, that as a veil
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1055
			-
				-
					Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1056
			-
				-
					Just confidence, and native righteousness,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1057
			-
				-
					And honour, from about them, naked left
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1058
			-
				-
					To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1059
			-
				-
					Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1060
			-

			-
				-
					Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1062
			-
				-
					Shorn of his strength. They destitute and bare
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1063
			-
				-
					Of all their virtue: Silent, and in face
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1064
			-
				-
					Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1065
			-
				-
					Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1066
			-
				-
					At length gave utterance to these words constrained.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1067
			-
				-
					O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1068
			-
				-
					To that false worm, of whomsoever taught
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1069
			-
				-
					To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1070
			-
				-
					False in our promised rising; since our eyes

			-
				Book 9: Line 1071
			-
				-
					Opened we find indeed, and find we know
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1072
			-
				-
					Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1073
			-
				-
					Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1074
			-
				-
					Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1075
			-
				-
					Of innocence, of faith, of purity,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1076
			-
				-
					Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1077
			-
				-
					And in our faces evident the signs
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1078
			-
				-
					Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1079
			-
				-
					Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1080
			-
				-
					Be sure then. - How shall I behold the face
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1081
			-
				-
					Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1082
			-
				-
					And rapture so oft beheld? Those heavenly shapes
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1083
			-
				-
					Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1084
			-
				-
					Insufferably bright. O! might I here
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1085
			-
				-
					In solitude live savage; in some glade
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1086
			-
				-
					Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1087
			-
				-
					To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1088
			-
				-
					And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1089
			-
				-
					Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1090
			-
				-
					Hide me, where I may never see them more! -
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1091
			-
				-
					But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1092
			-
				-
					What best may for the present serve to hide
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1093
			-
				-
					The parts of each from other, that seem most
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1094
			-
				-
					To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1095
			-
				-
					Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1096
			-
				-
					And girded on our loins, may cover round
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1097
			-
				-
					Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1098
			-
				-
					There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1099
			-
				-
					So counselled he, and both together went
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1100
			-
				-
					Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1101
			-
				-
					The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1102
			-
				-
					But such as at this day, to Indians known,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1103
			-
				-
					In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1104
			-
				-
					Branching so broad and long, that in the ground
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1105
			-
				-
					The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1106
			-
				-
					About the mother tree, a pillared shade
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1107
			-
				-
					High over-arched, and echoing walks between:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1108
			-
				-
					There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1109
			-
				-
					Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1110
			-
				-
					At loop-holes cut through thickest shade: Those leaves
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1111
			-
				-
					They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1112
			-
				-
					And, with what skill they had, together sewed,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1113
			-
				-
					To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1114
			-
				-
					Their guilt and dreaded shame! O, how unlike
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1115
			-
				-
					To that first naked glory! Such of late
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1116
			-
				-
					Columbus found the American, so girt
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1117
			-
				-
					With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1118
			-
				-
					Among the trees on isles and woody shores.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1119
			-
				-
					Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1120
			-
				-
					Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1121
			-
				-
					They sat them down to weep; nor only tears
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1122
			-
				-
					Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1123
			-
				-
					Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1124
			-
				-
					Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1125
			-
				-
					Their inward state of mind, calm region once
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1126
			-
				-
					And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1127
			-
				-
					For Understanding ruled not, and the Will
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1128
			-
				-
					Heard not her lore; both in subjection now
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1129
			-
				-
					To sensual Appetite, who from beneath
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1130
			-
				-
					Usurping over sovran Reason claimed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1131
			-
				-
					Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1132
			-
				-
					Adam, estranged in look and altered style,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1133
			-
				-
					Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1134
			-
				-
					Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1135
			-
				-
					With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1136
			-
				-
					Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1137
			-
				-
					I know not whence possessed thee; we had then
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1138
			-
				-
					Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1139
			-
				-
					Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1140
			-
				-
					Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1141
			-
				-
					The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1142
			-
				-
					Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1143
			-
				-
					To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1144
			-
				-
					What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1145
			-
				-
					Imputest thou that to my default, or will
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1146
			-
				-
					Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1147
			-
				-
					But might as ill have happened thou being by,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1148
			-
				-
					Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1149
			-
				-
					Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1150
			-
				-
					Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1151
			-
				-
					No ground of enmity between us known,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1152
			-
				-
					Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1153
			-
				-
					Was I to have never parted from thy side?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1154
			-
				-
					As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1155
			-
				-
					Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1156
			-
				-
					Command me absolutely not to go,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1157
			-
				-
					Going into such danger, as thou saidst?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1158
			-
				-
					Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1159
			-
				-
					Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1160
			-
				-
					Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1161
			-
				-
					Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1162
			-
				-
					To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1163
			-
				-
					Is this the love, is this the recompence
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1164
			-
				-
					Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1165
			-
				-
					Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1166
			-
				-
					Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1167
			-
				-
					Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1168
			-
				-
					And am I now upbraided as the cause
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1169
			-
				-
					Of thy transgressing? Not enough severe,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1170
			-
				-
					It seems, in thy restraint: What could I more
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1171
			-
				-
					I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1172
			-
				-
					The danger, and the lurking enemy
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1173
			-
				-
					That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1174
			-
				-
					And force upon free will hath here no place.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1175
			-
				-
					But confidence then bore thee on; secure
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1176
			-
				-
					Either to meet no danger, or to find
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1177
			-
				-
					Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1178
			-
				-
					I also erred, in overmuch admiring
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1179
			-
				-
					What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1180
			-
				-
					No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1181
			-
				-
					The errour now, which is become my crime,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1182
			-
				-
					And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1183
			-
				-
					Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1184
			-
				-
					Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1185
			-
				-
					And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1186
			-
				-
					She first his weak indulgence will accuse.
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1187
			-
				-
					Thus they in mutual accusation spent
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1188
			-
				-
					The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;
				-
			-
				Book 9: Line 1189
			-
				-
					And of their vain contest appeared no end.
				-
		-
			Book 10
		-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1
			-
				-
					Mean while the heinous and despiteful act
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 2
			-
				-
					Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 3
			-
				-
					He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 4
			-
				-
					Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 5
			-
				-
					Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 6
			-
				-
					Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 7
			-
				-
					Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 8
			-
				-
					Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 9
			-
				-
					Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 10
			-
				-
					Complete to have discovered and repulsed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 11
			-
				-
					Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 12
			-
				-
					For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 13
			-
				-
					The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 14
			-
				-
					Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 15
			-
				-
					(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 16
			-
				-
					And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 17
			-

					Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 18
			-
				-
					The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 19
			-
				-
					For Man; for of his state by this they knew,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 20
			-
				-
					Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 21
			-
				-
					Entrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 22
			-
				-
					From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 23
			-

					All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare

				Book 10: Line 24
			-

					That time celestial visages, yet, mixed

					About the new-arrived, in multitudes
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 27
			-

					The ethereal people ran, to hear and know

				Book 10: Line 28
			-
				-
					How all befel: They towards the throne supreme,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 29
			-
				-
					Accountable, made haste, to make appear,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 30
			-
				-
					With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 31
			-
				-
					And easily approved; when the Most High
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 32
			-
				-
					Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 33
			-
				-
					Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.

			-
				Book 10: Line 34
			-

					Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned
				-

				Book 10: Line 35

					From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,

				Book 10: Line 37
			-
				-
					Which your sincerest care could not prevent;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 38
			-
				-
					Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 39
			-
				-
					When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 40
			-
				-
					I told ye then he should prevail, and speed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 41
			-
				-
					On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 42
			-
				-
					And flattered out of all, believing lies
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 43
			-
				-
					Against his Maker; no decree of mine
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 44
			-
				-
					Concurring to necessitate his fall,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 45
			-
				-
					Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 46
			-
				-
					His free will, to her own inclining left
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 47
			-
				-
					In even scale. But fallen he is; and now
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 48
			-
				-
					What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 49
			-
				-
					On his transgression, - death denounced that day?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 50
			-
				-
					Which he presumes already vain and void,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 51
			-
				-
					Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 52
			-
				-
					By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find

					But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,

			-
				Book 10: Line 56
			-
				-
					Vicegerent Son? To thee I have transferred
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 57
			-
				-
					All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 58
			-
				-
					Easy it may be seen that I intend
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 59
			-
				-
					Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 60
			-
				-
					Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 61
			-
				-
					Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 62
			-

					And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 63

					Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son
				-

				Book 10: Line 65

					Resplendent all his Father manifest

					Father Eternal, thine is to decree;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 69
			-
				-
					Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 70
			-
				-
					Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 71
			-
				-
					Mayest ever rest well pleased. I go to judge
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 72
			-
				-
					On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 73
			-
				-
					Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 74
			-
				-
					When time shall be; for so I undertook
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 75
			-
				-
					Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 76
			-
				-
					Of right, that I may mitigate their doom
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 77
			-
				-
					On me derived; yet I shall temper so
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 78
			-
				-
					Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 79
			-
				-
					Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 80
			-
				-
					Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 81
			-
				-
					Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 82
			-
				-
					Those two; the third best absent is condemned,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 83
			-
				-
					Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 84
			-
				-
					Conviction to the serpent none belongs.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 85
			-
				-
					Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 86
			-
				-
					Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 87
			-
				-
					Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 88
			-
				-
					Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 89
			-
				-
					Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 90
			-
				-
					Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 91
			-
				-
					Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 92
			-
				-
					Now was the sun in western cadence low
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 93
			-
				-
					From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 94
			-
				-
					To fan the earth now waked, and usher in
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 95
			-
				-
					The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 96
			-
				-
					Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 97
			-
				-
					To sentence Man: The voice of God they heard
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 98
			-
				-
					Now walking in the garden, by soft winds
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 99
			-
				-
					Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 100
			-
				-
					And from his presence hid themselves among
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 101
			-
				-
					The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 102
			-
				-
					Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 103
			-
				-
					Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 104
			-
				-
					My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 105
			-
				-
					Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 106
			-
				-
					Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 107
			-
				-
					Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 108
			-
				-
					Absents thee, or what chance detains? - Come forth!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 109
			-
				-
					He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 110
			-
				-
					To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 111
			-
				-
					Love was not in their looks, either to God,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 112
			-
				-
					Or to each other; but apparent guilt,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 113
			-
				-
					And shame, and perturbation, and despair,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 114
			-
				-
					Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 115
			-
				-
					Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 116
			-
				-
					I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 117
			-
				-
					Afraid, being naked, hid myself. To whom
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 118
			-
				-
					The gracious Judge without revile replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 119
			-
				-
					My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 120
			-
				-
					But still rejoiced; how is it now become
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 121
			-
				-
					So dreadful to thee? That thou art naked, who
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 122
			-
				-
					Hath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the tree,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 123
			-
				-
					Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 124
			-
				-
					To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 125
			-
				-
					O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 126
			-
				-
					Before my Judge; either to undergo
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 127
			-
				-
					Myself the total crime, or to accuse
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 128
			-
				-
					My other self, the partner of my life;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 129
			-
				-
					Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 130
			-
				-
					I should conceal, and not expose to blame
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 131
			-
				-
					By my complaint: but strict necessity
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 132
			-
				-
					Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 133
			-
				-
					Lest on my head both sin and punishment,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 134
			-
				-
					However insupportable, be all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 135
			-
				-
					Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 136
			-
				-
					Wouldst easily detect what I conceal. -
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 137
			-
				-
					This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 138
			-
				-
					And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 139
			-
				-
					So fit, so acceptable, so divine,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 140
			-
				-
					That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 141
			-
				-
					And what she did, whatever in itself,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 142
			-
				-
					Her doing seemed to justify the deed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 143
			-
				-
					She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 144
			-
				-
					To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 145
			-
				-
					Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 146
			-
				-
					Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 147
			-
				-
					Superiour, or but equal, that to her
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 148
			-
				-
					Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 149
			-
				-
					Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 150
			-
				-
					And for thee, whose perfection far excelled
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 151
			-
				-
					Hers in all real dignity? Adorned
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 152
			-
				-
					She was indeed, and lovely, to attract
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 153
			-
				-
					Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 154
			-
				-
					Were such, as under government well seemed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 155
			-
				-
					Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 156
			-
				-
					And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 157
			-
				-
					So having said, he thus to Eve in few.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 158
			-
				-
					Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 159
			-
				-
					To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 160
			-
				-
					Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 161
			-
				-
					Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 162
			-
				-
					The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 163
			-
				-
					Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 164
			-
				-
					To judgement he proceeded on the accused
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 165
			-
				-
					Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 166
			-
				-
					The guilt on him, who made him instrument
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 167
			-
				-
					Of mischief, and polluted from the end
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 168
			-
				-
					Of his creation; justly then accursed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 169
			-
				-
					As vitiated in nature: More to know
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 170
			-
				-
					Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 171
			-
				-
					Nor altered his offence; yet God at last
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 172
			-
				-
					To Satan first in sin his doom applied,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 173
			-
				-
					Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 174
			-
				-
					And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 175
			-
				-
					Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 176
			-
				-
					Above all cattle, each beast of the field;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 177
			-
				-
					Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 178
			-
				-
					And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 179
			-
				-
					Between thee and the woman I will put
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 180
			-
				-
					Enmity, and between thine and her seed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 181
			-
				-
					Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 182
			-
				-
					So spake this oracle, then verified
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 183
			-
				-
					When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 184
			-
				-
					Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 185
			-
				-
					Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 186
			-
				-
					Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 187
			-
				-
					In open show; and, with ascension bright,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 188
			-
				-
					Captivity led captive through the air,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 189
			-
				-
					The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 190
			-
				-
					Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 191
			-
				-
					Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 192
			-
				-
					And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 193
			-
				-
					Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 194
			-
				-
					By thy conception; children thou shalt bring
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 195
			-
				-
					In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 196
			-
				-
					Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 197
			-
				-
					On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 198
			-
				-
					Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 199
			-
				-
					And eaten of the tree, concerning which
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 200
			-
				-
					I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 201
			-
				-
					Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 202
			-
				-
					Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 203
			-
				-
					Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 204
			-
				-
					Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 205
			-
				-
					In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 206
			-
				-
					Till thou return unto the ground; for thou
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 207
			-
				-
					Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 208
			-
				-
					For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 209
			-
				-
					So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 210
			-
				-
					And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 211
			-
				-
					Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 212
			-
				-
					Before him naked to the air, that now
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 213
			-
				-
					Must suffer change, disdained not to begin
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 214
			-
				-
					Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 215
			-
				-
					As when he washed his servants feet; so now,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 216
			-
				-
					As father of his family, he clad
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 217
			-
				-
					Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 218
			-
				-
					Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 219
			-
				-
					And thought not much to clothe his enemies;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 220
			-
				-
					Nor he their outward only with the skins
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 221
			-
				-
					Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 222
			-
				-
					Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 223
			-
				-
					Arraying, covered from his Father's sight.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 224
			-
				-
					To him with swift ascent he up returned,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 225
			-
				-
					Into his blissful bosom reassumed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 226
			-
				-
					In glory, as of old; to him appeased
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 227
			-
				-
					All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 228
			-
				-
					Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 229
			-
				-
					Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 230
			-
				-
					Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 231
			-
				-
					In counterview within the gates, that now
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 232
			-
				-
					Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 233
			-
				-
					Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 234
			-
				-
					Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 235
			-
				-
					O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 236
			-
				-
					Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 237
			-
				-
					In other worlds, and happier seat provides
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 238
			-
				-
					For us, his offspring dear? It cannot be
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 239
			-
				-
					But that success attends him; if mishap,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 240
			-
				-
					Ere this he had returned, with fury driven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 241
			-
				-
					By his avengers; since no place like this
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 242
			-
				-
					Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 243
			-
				-
					Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 244
			-
				-
					Wings growing, and dominion given me large
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 245
			-
				-
					Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 246
			-
				-
					Or sympathy, or some connatural force,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 247
			-
				-
					Powerful at greatest distance to unite,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 248
			-
				-
					With secret amity, things of like kind,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 249
			-
				-
					By secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 250
			-
				-
					Inseparable, must with me along;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 251
			-
				-
					For Death from Sin no power can separate.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 252
			-
				-
					But, lest the difficulty of passing back
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 253
			-
				-
					Stay his return perhaps over this gulf
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 254
			-
				-
					Impassable, impervious; let us try
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 255
			-
				-
					Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 256
			-
				-
					Not unagreeable, to found a path
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 257
			-
				-
					Over this main from Hell to that new world,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 258
			-
				-
					Where Satan now prevails; a monument
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 259
			-
				-
					Of merit high to all the infernal host,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 260
			-
				-
					Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 261
			-
				-
					Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 262
			-
				-
					Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 263
			-
				-
					By this new-felt attraction and instinct.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 264
			-
				-
					Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.

					Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 266
			-
				-
					Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 267
			-
				-
					The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 268
			-
				-
					Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 269
			-
				-
					The savour of death from all things there that live:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 270
			-
				-
					Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 271
			-
				-
					Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 272
			-
				-
					So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 273
			-
				-
					Of mortal change on earth. As when a flock
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 274
			-
				-
					Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 275
			-
				-
					Against the day of battle, to a field,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 276
			-
				-
					Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 277
			-
				-
					With scent of living carcasses designed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 278
			-
				-
					For death, the following day, in bloody fight:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 279
			-
				-
					So scented the grim Feature, and upturned
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 280
			-
				-
					His nostril wide into the murky air;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 281
			-
				-
					Sagacious of his quarry from so far.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 282
			-
				-
					Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 283
			-
				-
					Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 284
			-
				-
					Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 285
			-
				-
					Hovering upon the waters, what they met
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 286
			-
				-
					Solid or slimy, as in raging sea
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 287
			-
				-
					Tost up and down, together crouded drove,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 288
			-
				-
					From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 289
			-
				-
					As when two polar winds, blowing adverse
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 290
			-
				-
					Upon the Cronian sea, together drive
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 291
			-
				-
					Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 292
			-
				-
					Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 293
			-
				-
					Cathaian coast. The aggregated soil
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 294
			-
				-
					Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 295
			-
				-
					As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 296
			-
				-
					As Delos, floating once; the rest his look
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 297
			-
				-
					Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 298
			-
				-
					And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 299
			-
				-
					Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 300
			-
				-
					They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 301
			-
				-
					Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 302
			-
				-
					Of length prodigious, joining to the wall
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 303
			-
				-
					Immoveable of this now fenceless world,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 304
			-
				-
					Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 305
			-
				-
					Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 306
			-
				-
					So, if great things to small may be compared,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 307
			-
				-
					Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 308
			-
				-
					From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 309
			-
				-
					Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 310
			-
				-
					Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 311
			-
				-
					And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 312
			-
				-
					Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 313
			-
				-
					Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 314
			-
				-
					Over the vexed abyss, following the track
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 315
			-
				-
					Of Satan to the self-same place where he
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 316
			-
				-
					First lighted from his wing, and landed safe
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 317
			-
				-
					From out of Chaos, to the outside bare
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 318
			-
				-
					Of this round world: With pins of adamant
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 319
			-
				-
					And chains they made all fast, too fast they made
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 320
			-
				-
					And durable! And now in little space
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 321
			-
				-
					The confines met of empyrean Heaven,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 322
			-
				-
					And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 323
			-
				-
					With long reach interposed; three several ways
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 324
			-
				-
					In sight, to each of these three places led.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 325
			-
				-
					And now their way to Earth they had descried,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 326
			-
				-
					To Paradise first tending; when, behold!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 327
			-
				-
					Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 328
			-
				-
					Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 329
			-
				-
					His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 330
			-
				-
					Disguised he came; but those his children dear
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 331
			-
				-
					Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 332
			-
				-
					He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 333
			-
				-
					Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 334
			-
				-
					To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 335
			-
				-
					By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 336
			-
				-
					Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 337
			-
				-
					Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 338
			-
				-
					The Son of God to judge them, terrified
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 339
			-
				-
					He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 340
			-
				-
					The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 341
			-
				-
					Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 342
			-
				-
					By night, and listening where the hapless pair
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 343
			-
				-
					Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 344
			-
				-
					Thence gathered his own doom; which understood
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 345
			-
				-
					Not instant, but of future time, with joy
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 346
			-
				-
					And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 347
			-
				-
					And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 348
			-
				-
					Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 349
			-
				-
					Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 350
			-
				-
					Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 351
			-
				-
					Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 352
			-
				-
					Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 353
			-
				-
					Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 354
			-
				-
					O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 355
			-
				-
					Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 356
			-
				-
					Thou art their author, and prime architect:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 357
			-
				-
					For I no sooner in my heart divined,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 358
			-
				-
					My heart, which by a secret harmony
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 359
			-
				-
					Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 360
			-
				-
					That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 361
			-
				-
					Now also evidence, but straight I felt,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 362
			-
				-
					Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 363
			-
				-
					That I must after thee, with this thy son;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 364
			-
				-
					Such fatal consequence unites us three!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 365
			-
				-
					Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 366
			-
				-
					Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 367
			-
				-
					Detain from following thy illustrious track.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 368
			-
				-
					Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 369
			-
				-
					Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 370
			-
				-
					To fortify thus far, and overlay,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 371
			-
				-
					With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 372
			-
				-
					Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 373
			-
				-
					What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 374
			-
				-
					With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 375
			-
				-
					Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 376
			-
				-
					There didst not; there let him still victor sway,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 377
			-
				-
					As battle hath adjudged; from this new world
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 378
			-
				-
					Retiring, by his own doom alienated;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 379
			-
				-
					And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 380
			-
				-
					Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 381
			-
				-
					His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 382
			-
				-
					Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 383
			-
				-
					Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 384
			-
				-
					Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 385
			-
				-
					High proof ye now have given to be the race
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 386
			-
				-
					Of Satan (for I glory in the name,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 387
			-
				-
					Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,)
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 388
			-
				-
					Amply have merited of me, of all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 389
			-
				-
					The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 390
			-
				-
					Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 391
			-
				-
					Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 392
			-
				-
					Hell and this world, one realm, one continent
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 393
			-
				-
					Of easy thorough-fare. Therefore, while I
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 394
			-
				-
					Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 395
			-
				-
					To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 396
			-
				-
					With these successes, and with them rejoice;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 397
			-
				-
					You two this way, among these numerous orbs,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 398
			-
				-
					All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 399
			-
				-
					There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 400
			-
				-
					Dominion exercise and in the air,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 401
			-
				-
					Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 402
			-
				-
					Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 403
			-
				-
					My substitutes I send ye, and create
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 404
			-
				-
					Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 405
			-
				-
					Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 406
			-
				-
					My hold of this new kingdom all depends,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 407
			-
				-
					Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 408
			-
				-
					If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 409
			-
				-
					No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 410
			-
				-
					So saying he dismissed them; they with speed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 411
			-
				-
					Their course through thickest constellations held,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 412
			-
				-
					Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 413
			-
				-
					And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 414
			-
				-
					Then suffered. The other way Satan went down
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 415
			-
				-
					The causey to Hell-gate: On either side
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 416
			-
				-
					Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 417
			-
				-
					And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 418
			-
				-
					That scorned his indignation: Through the gate,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 419
			-
				-
					Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 420
			-
				-
					And all about found desolate; for those,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 421
			-
				-
					Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 422
			-
				-
					Flown to the upper world; the rest were all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 423
			-
				-
					Far to the inland retired, about the walls
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 424
			-
				-
					Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 425
			-
				-
					Of Lucifer, so by allusion called
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 426
			-
				-
					Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 427
			-
				-
					There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 428
			-
				-
					In council sat, solicitous what chance
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 429
			-
				-
					Might intercept their emperour sent; so he
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 430
			-
				-
					Departing gave command, and they observed.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 431
			-
				-
					As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 432
			-
				-
					By Astracan, over the snowy plains,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 433
			-
				-
					Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 434
			-
				-
					Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 435
			-
				-
					The realm of Aladule, in his retreat
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 436
			-
				-
					To Tauris or Casbeen: So these, the late
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 437
			-
				-
					Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 438
			-
				-
					Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 439
			-
				-
					Round their metropolis; and now expecting
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 440
			-
				-
					Each hour their great adventurer, from the search
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 441
			-
				-
					Of foreign worlds: He through the midst unmarked,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 442
			-
				-
					In show plebeian Angel militant
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 443
			-
				-
					Of lowest order, passed; and from the door
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 444
			-
				-
					Of that Plutonian hall, invisible
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 445
			-
				-
					Ascended his high throne; which, under state
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 446
			-
				-
					Of richest texture spread, at the upper end
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 447
			-
				-
					Was placed in regal lustre. Down a while
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 448
			-
				-
					He sat, and round about him saw unseen:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 449
			-
				-
					At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 450
			-
				-
					And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 451
			-
				-
					With what permissive glory since his fall
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 452
			-
				-
					Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 453
			-
				-
					At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 454
			-
				-
					Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 455
			-
				-
					Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 456
			-
				-
					Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 457
			-
				-
					Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 458
			-
				-
					Congratulant approached him; who with hand
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 459
			-
				-
					Silence, and with these words attention, won.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 460
			-
				-
					Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;

				Book 10: Line 462
			-
				-
					I call ye, and declare ye now; returned
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 463
			-
				-
					Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 464
			-
				-
					Triumphant out of this infernal pit
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 465
			-
				-
					Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 466
			-
				-
					And dungeon of our tyrant: Now possess,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 467
			-
				-
					As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 468
			-
				-
					Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 469
			-
				-
					With peril great achieved. Long were to tell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 470
			-
				-
					What I have done; what suffered; with what pain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 471
			-
				-
					Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 472
			-
				-
					Of horrible confusion; over which
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 473
			-
				-
					By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 474
			-
				-
					To expedite your glorious march; but I
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 475
			-
				-
					Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 476
			-
				-
					The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 477
			-
				-
					Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 478
			-
				-
					That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 479
			-
				-
					My journey strange, with clamorous uproar
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 480
			-
				-
					Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 481
			-
				-
					The new created world, which fame in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 482
			-
				-
					Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 483
			-
				-
					Of absolute perfection! therein Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 484
			-
				-
					Placed in a Paradise, by our exile
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 485
			-
				-
					Made happy: Him by fraud I have seduced
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 486
			-
				-
					From his Creator; and, the more to encrease
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 487
			-
				-
					Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 488
			-
				-
					Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 489
			-
				-
					Both his beloved Man, and all his world,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 490
			-
				-
					To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 491
			-
				-
					Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 492
			-
				-
					To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 493
			-
				-
					To rule, as over all he should have ruled.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 494
			-
				-
					True is, me also he hath judged, or rather
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 495
			-
				-
					Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 496
			-
				-
					Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 497
			-
				-
					Is enmity which he will put between
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 498
			-
				-
					Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 499
			-
				-
					His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 500
			-
				-
					A world who would not purchase with a bruise,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 501
			-
				-
					Or much more grievous pain? - Ye have the account
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 502
			-
				-
					Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 503
			-
				-
					But up, and enter now into full bliss?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 504
			-
				-
					So having said, a while he stood, expecting
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 505
			-
				-
					Their universal shout, and high applause,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 506
			-
				-
					To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 507
			-
				-
					On all sides, from innumerable tongues,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 508
			-
				-
					A dismal universal hiss, the sound
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 509
			-
				-
					Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 510
			-
				-
					Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 511
			-
				-
					His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 512
			-
				-
					His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 513
			-
				-
					Each other, till supplanted down he fell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 514
			-
				-
					A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 515
			-
				-
					Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 516
			-
				-
					Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 517
			-
				-
					According to his doom: he would have spoke,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 518
			-
				-
					But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 519
			-
				-
					To forked tongue; for now were all transformed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 520
			-
				-
					Alike, to serpents all, as accessories
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 521
			-
				-
					To his bold riot: Dreadful was the din
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 522
			-
				-
					Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 523
			-
				-
					With complicated monsters head and tail,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 524
			-
				-
					Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 525
			-
				-
					Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 526
			-
				-
					And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 527
			-
				-
					Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 528
			-
				-
					Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 529
			-
				-
					Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 530
			-
				-
					Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 531
			-
				-
					Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 532
			-
				-
					Above the rest still to retain; they all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 533
			-
				-
					Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 534
			-
				-
					Where all yet left of that revolted rout,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 535
			-
				-
					Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 536
			-
				-
					Sublime with expectation when to see
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 537
			-
				-
					In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 538
			-
				-
					They saw, but other sight instead! a croud
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 539
			-
				-
					Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 540
			-
				-
					And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 541
			-
				-
					They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 542
			-
				-
					Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 543
			-
				-
					And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 544
			-
				-
					Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 545
			-
				-
					As in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 546
			-
				-
					Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 547
			-
				-
					Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 548
			-
				-
					A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 549
			-
				-
					His will who reigns above, to aggravate
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 550
			-
				-
					Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 551
			-
				-
					Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 552
			-
				-
					Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 553
			-
				-
					Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 554
			-
				-
					For one forbidden tree a multitude
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 555
			-
				-
					Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 556
			-
				-
					Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 557
			-
				-
					Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 558
			-
				-
					But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 559
			-
				-
					Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 560
			-
				-
					That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 561
			-
				-
					The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 562
			-
				-
					Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 563
			-
				-
					This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 564
			-
				-
					Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 565
			-
				-
					Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 566
			-
				-
					Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 567
			-
				-
					With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 568
			-
				-
					Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 569
			-
				-
					With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 570
			-
				-
					With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 571
			-
				-
					Into the same illusion, not as Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 572
			-
				-
					Whom they triumphed once lapsed. Thus were they plagued
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 573
			-
				-
					And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 574
			-
				-
					Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 575
			-
				-
					Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 576
			-
				-
					This annual humbling certain numbered days,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 577
			-
				-
					To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 578
			-
				-
					However, some tradition they dispersed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 579
			-
				-
					Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 580
			-
				-
					And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 581
			-
				-
					Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide -
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 582
			-
				-
					Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 583
			-
				-
					Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 584
			-
				-
					And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 585
			-
				-
					Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 586
			-
				-
					Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 587
			-
				-
					Once actual; now in body, and to dwell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 588
			-
				-
					Habitual habitant; behind her Death,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 589
			-
				-
					Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 590
			-
				-
					On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 591
			-
				-
					Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 592
			-
				-
					What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 593
			-
				-
					With travel difficult, not better far
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 594
			-
				-
					Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 595
			-
				-
					Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 596
			-
				-
					Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 597
			-
				-
					To me, who with eternal famine pine,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 598
			-
				-
					Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 599
			-
				-
					There best, where most with ravine I may meet;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 600
			-
				-
					Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 601
			-
				-
					To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 602
			-
				-
					To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 603
			-
				-
					Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 604
			-
				-
					Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 605
			-
				-
					No homely morsels! and, whatever thing
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 606
			-
				-
					The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 607
			-
				-
					Till I, in Man residing, through the race,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 608
			-
				-
					His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 609
			-
				-
					And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 610
			-
				-
					This said, they both betook them several ways,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 611
			-
				-
					Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 612
			-
				-
					All kinds, and for destruction to mature
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 613
			-
				-
					Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 614
			-
				-
					From his transcendent seat the Saints among,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 615
			-
				-
					To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 616
			-
				-
					See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 617
			-
				-
					To waste and havock yonder world, which I
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 618
			-
				-
					So fair and good created; and had still
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 619
			-
				-
					Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 620
			-
				-
					Let in these wasteful furies, who impute
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 621
			-
				-
					Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 622
			-
				-
					And his adherents, that with so much ease
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 623
			-
				-
					I suffer them to enter and possess
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 624
			-
				-
					A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 625
			-
				-
					To gratify my scornful enemies,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 626
			-
				-
					That laugh, as if, transported with some fit
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 627
			-
				-
					Of passion, I to them had quitted all,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 628
			-
				-
					At random yielded up to their misrule;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 629
			-
				-
					And know not that I called, and drew them thither,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 630
			-
				-
					My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 631
			-
				-
					Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 632
			-
				-
					On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 633
			-
				-
					With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 634
			-
				-
					Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 635
			-
				-
					Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 636
			-
				-
					Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 637
			-
				-
					For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 638
			-
				-
					Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 639
			-
				-
					To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 640
			-
				-
					Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 641
			-
				-
					He ended, and the heavenly audience loud
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 642
			-
				-
					Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 643
			-
				-
					Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 644
			-
				-
					Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 645
			-
				-
					Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 646
			-
				-
					Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 647
			-
				-
					New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 648
			-
				-
					Or down from Heaven descend. - Such was their song;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 649
			-
				-
					While the Creator, calling forth by name
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 650
			-
				-
					His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 651
			-
				-
					As sorted best with present things. The sun
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 652
			-
				-
					Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 653
			-
				-
					As might affect the earth with cold and heat
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 654
			-
				-
					Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 655
			-
				-
					Decrepit winter; from the south to bring

				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 729

			-
				Book 10: Line 731

			-
				Book 10: Line 734
			-

				Book 10: Line 736
			-
				-
					For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 737

			-
				-
					Mine own that bide upon me, all from me
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 739

					On me, as on their natural center, light

				Book 10: Line 741

					Heavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys

			-
				Book 10: Line 742
			-
				-
					Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 743
			-
				-
					Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 744
			-
				-
					To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 745
			-
				-
					From darkness to promote me, or here place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 746
			-
				-
					In this delicious garden? As my will
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 747
			-
				-
					Concurred not to my being, it were but right
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 748
			-
				-
					And equal to reduce me to my dust;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 749
			-
				-
					Desirous to resign and render back
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 750
			-
				-
					All I received; unable to perform
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 751
			-
				-
					Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 752
			-
				-
					The good I sought not. To the loss of that,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 753
			-
				-
					Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 754
			-
				-
					The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 755
			-
				-
					Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 756
			-
				-
					I thus contest; then should have been refused
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 757
			-
				-
					Those terms whatever, when they were proposed:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 758
			-
				-
					Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 759
			-
				-
					Then cavil the conditions? And, though God
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 760
			-
				-
					Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 761
			-
				-
					Prove disobedient, and reproved, retort,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 762
			-
				-
					“Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not!”
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 763
			-
				-
					Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 764
			-
				-
					That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 765
			-
				-
					But natural necessity begot.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 766
			-
				-
					God made thee of choice his own, and of his own
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 767
			-
				-
					To serve him; thy reward was of his grace;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 768
			-
				-
					Thy punishment then, justly is at his will.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 769
			-
				-
					Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 770
			-
				-
					That dust I am, and shall to dust return.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 771
			-
				-
					O welcome hour whenever! Why delays
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 772
			-
				-
					His hand to execute what his decree
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 773
			-
				-
					Fixed on this day? Why do I overlive,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 774
			-
				-
					Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 775
			-
				-
					To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 776
			-
				-
					Mortality my sentence, and be earth
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 777
			-
				-
					Insensible! How glad would lay me down
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 778
			-
				-
					As in my mother's lap! There I should rest,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 779
			-
				-
					And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 780
			-
				-
					Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 781
			-
				-
					To me, and to my offspring, would torment me
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 782
			-
				-
					With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 783
			-
				-
					Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 784
			-
				-
					Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 785
			-
				-
					Which God inspired, cannot together perish
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 786
			-
				-
					With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 787
			-
				-
					Or in some other dismal place, who knows
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 788
			-
				-
					But I shall die a living death? O thought
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 789
			-
				-
					Horrid, if true! Yet why? It was but breath
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 790
			-
				-
					Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 791
			-
				-
					And sin? The body properly had neither,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 792
			-
				-
					All of me then shall die: let this appease
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 793
			-
				-
					The doubt, since human reach no further knows.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 794
			-
				-
					For though the Lord of all be infinite,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 795
			-
				-
					Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 796
			-
				-
					But mortal doomed. How can he exercise
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 797
			-
				-
					Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 798
			-
				-
					Can he make deathless death? That were to make
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 799
			-
				-
					Strange contradiction, which to God himself
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 800
			-
				-
					Impossible is held; as argument
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 801
			-
				-
					Of weakness, not of power. Will he draw out,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 802
			-
				-
					For anger's sake, finite to infinite,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 803
			-
				-
					In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 804
			-
				-
					Satisfied never? That were to extend
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 805
			-
				-
					His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 806
			-
				-
					By which all causes else, according still
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 807
			-
				-
					To the reception of their matter, act;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 808
			-
				-
					Not to the extent of their own sphere. But say
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 809
			-
				-
					That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 810
			-
				-
					Bereaving sense, but endless misery
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 811
			-
				-
					From this day onward; which I feel begun
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 812
			-
				-
					Both in me, and without me; and so last
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 813
			-
				-
					To perpetuity; - Ay me! that fear
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 814
			-
				-
					Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 815
			-
				-
					On my defenceless head; both Death and I
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 816
			-
				-
					Am found eternal, and incorporate both;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 817
			-
				-
					Nor I on my part single; in me all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 818
			-
				-
					Posterity stands cursed: Fair patrimony
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 819
			-
				-
					That I must leave ye, Sons! O, were I able
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 820
			-
				-
					To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 821
			-
				-
					So disinherited, how would you bless
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 822
			-
				-
					Me, now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 823
			-
				-
					For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 824
			-
				-
					It guiltless? But from me what can proceed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 825
			-
				-
					But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 826
			-
				-
					Not to do only, but to will the same
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 827
			-
				-
					With me? How can they then acquitted stand
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 828
			-
				-
					In sight of God? Him, after all disputes,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 829
			-
				-
					Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 830
			-
				-
					And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 831
			-
				-
					But to my own conviction: first and last
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 832
			-
				-
					On me, me only, as the source and spring
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 833
			-
				-
					Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 834
			-
				-
					So might the wrath! Fond wish! couldst thou support
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 835
			-
				-
					That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 836
			-
				-
					Than all the world much heavier, though divided
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 837
			-
				-
					With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desirest,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 838
			-
				-
					And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 839
			-
				-
					Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 840
			-
				-
					Beyond all past example and future;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 841
			-
				-
					To Satan only like both crime and doom.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 842
			-
				-
					O Conscience! into what abyss of fears
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 843
			-
				-
					And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 844
			-
				-
					I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 845
			-
				-
					Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 846
			-
				-
					Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 847
			-
				-
					Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 848
			-
				-
					Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 849
			-
				-
					Which to his evil conscience represented
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 850
			-
				-
					All things with double terrour: On the ground
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 851
			-
				-
					Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 852
			-
				-
					Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 853
			-
				-
					Of tardy execution, since denounced
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 854
			-
				-
					The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 855
			-
				-
					Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 856
			-
				-
					To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 857
			-
				-
					Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 858
			-
				-
					But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 859
			-
				-
					Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 860
			-
				-
					O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 861
			-
				-
					With other echo late I taught your shades
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 862
			-
				-
					To answer, and resound far other song. -
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 863
			-
				-
					Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 864
			-
				-
					Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 865
			-
				-
					Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 866
			-
				-
					But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 867
			-
				-
					Out of my sight, thou Serpent! That name best
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 868
			-
				-
					Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 869
			-
				-
					And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 870
			-
				-
					Like his, and colour serpentine, may show
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 871
			-
				-
					Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 872
			-
				-
					Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 873
			-
				-
					To hellish falshood, snare them! But for thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 874
			-
				-
					I had persisted happy; had not thy pride
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 875
			-
				-
					And wandering vanity, when least was safe,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 876
			-
				-
					Rejected my forewarning, and disdained
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 877
			-
				-
					Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 878
			-
				-
					Though by the Devil himself; him overweening
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 879
			-
				-
					To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 880
			-
				-
					Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 881
			-
				-
					To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 882
			-
				-
					Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 883
			-
				-
					And understood not all was but a show,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 884
			-
				-
					Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 885
			-
				-
					Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 886
			-
				-
					More to the part sinister, from me drawn;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 887
			-
				-
					Well if thrown out, as supernumerary
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 888
			-
				-
					To my just number found. O! why did God,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 889
			-
				-
					Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 890
			-
				-
					With Spirits masculine, create at last
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 891
			-
				-
					This novelty on earth, this fair defect
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 892
			-
				-
					Of nature, and not fill the world at once
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 893
			-
				-
					With Men, as Angels, without feminine;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 894
			-
				-
					Or find some other way to generate
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 895
			-
				-
					Mankind? This mischief had not been befallen,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 896
			-
				-
					And more that shall befall; innumerable
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 897
			-
				-
					Disturbances on earth through female snares,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 898
			-
				-
					And strait conjunction with this sex: for either
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 899
			-
				-
					He never shall find out fit mate, but such
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 900
			-
				-
					As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 901
			-
				-
					Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 902
			-
				-
					Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 903
			-
				-
					By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 904
			-
				-
					By parents; or his happiest choice too late
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 905
			-
				-
					Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 906
			-
				-
					To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 907
			-
				-
					Which infinite calamity shall cause
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 908
			-
				-
					To human life, and houshold peace confound.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 909
			-
				-
					He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 910
			-
				-
					Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 911
			-
				-
					And tresses all disordered, at his feet
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 912
			-
				-
					Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 913
			-
				-
					His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 914
			-
				-
					Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 915
			-
				-
					What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 916
			-
				-
					I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 917
			-
				-
					Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 918
			-
				-
					I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 919
			-
				-
					Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 920
			-
				-
					Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 921
			-
				-
					My only strength and stay: Forlorn of thee,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 922
			-
				-
					Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 923
			-
				-
					While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 924
			-
				-
					Between us two let there be peace; both joining,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 925
			-
				-
					As joined in injuries, one enmity
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 926
			-
				-
					Against a foe by doom express assigned us,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 927
			-
				-
					That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 928
			-
				-
					Thy hatred for this misery befallen;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 929
			-
				-
					On me already lost, me than thyself
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 930
			-
				-
					More miserable! Both have sinned; but thou
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 931
			-
				-
					Against God only; I against God and thee;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 932
			-
				-
					And to the place of judgement will return,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 933
			-
				-
					There with my cries importune Heaven; that all
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 934
			-
				-
					The sentence, from thy head removed, may light
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 935
			-
				-
					On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 936
			-
				-
					Me, me only, just object of his ire!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 937
			-
				-
					She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 938
			-
				-
					Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 939
			-
				-
					Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 940
			-
				-
					Commiseration: Soon his heart relented
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 941
			-
				-
					Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 942
			-
				-
					Now at his feet submissive in distress;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 943
			-
				-
					Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 944
			-
				-
					His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 945
			-
				-
					As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 946
			-
				-
					And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 947
			-
				-
					Unwary, and too desirous, as before,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 948
			-
				-
					So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 949
			-
				-
					The punishment all on thyself; alas!
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 950
			-
				-
					Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 951
			-
				-
					His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 952
			-
				-
					And my displeasure bearest so ill. If prayers
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 953
			-
				-
					Could alter high decrees, I to that place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 954
			-
				-
					Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 955
			-
				-
					That on my head all might be visited;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 956
			-
				-
					Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 957
			-
				-
					To me committed, and by me exposed.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 958
			-
				-
					But rise; - let us no more contend, nor blame
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 959
			-
				-
					Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 960
			-
				-
					In offices of love, how we may lighten
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 961
			-
				-
					Each other's burden, in our share of woe;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 962
			-
				-
					Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 963
			-
				-
					Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 964
			-
				-
					A long day's dying, to augment our pain;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 965
			-
				-
					And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 966
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 967
			-
				-
					Adam, by sad experiment I know
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 968
			-
				-
					How little weight my words with thee can find,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 969
			-
				-
					Found so erroneous; thence by just event
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 970
			-
				-
					Found so unfortunate: Nevertheless,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 971
			-
				-
					Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 972
			-
				-
					Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 973
			-
				-
					Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 974
			-
				-
					Living or dying, from thee I will not hide
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 975
			-
				-
					What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 976
			-
				-
					Tending to some relief of our extremes,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 977
			-
				-
					Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 978
			-
				-
					As in our evils, and of easier choice.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 979
			-
				-
					If care of our descent perplex us most,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 980
			-
				-
					Which must be born to certain woe, devoured
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 981
			-
				-
					By Death at last; and miserable it is
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 982
			-
				-
					To be to others cause of misery,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 983
			-
				-
					Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 984
			-
				-
					Into this cursed world a woeful race,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 985
			-
				-
					That after wretched life must be at last
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 986
			-
				-
					Food for so foul a monster; in thy power
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 987
			-
				-
					It lies, yet ere conception to prevent
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 988
			-
				-
					The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 989
			-
				-
					Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 990
			-
				-
					Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 991
			-
				-
					Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 992
			-
				-
					But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 993
			-
				-
					Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 994
			-
				-
					From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 995
			-
				-
					And with desire to languish without hope,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 996
			-
				-
					Before the present object languishing
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 997
			-
				-
					With like desire; which would be misery
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 998
			-
				-
					And torment less than none of what we dread;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 999
			-
				-
					Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1000
			-
				-
					From what we fear for both, let us make short, -
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1001
			-
				-
					Let us seek Death; - or, he not found, supply
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1002
			-
				-
					With our own hands his office on ourselves:
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1003
			-
				-
					Why stand we longer shivering under fears,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1004
			-
				-
					That show no end but death, and have the power,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1005
			-
				-
					Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1006
			-
				-
					Destruction with destruction to destroy? -
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1007
			-
				-
					She ended here, or vehement despair
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1008
			-
				-
					Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1009
			-
				-
					Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1010
			-
				-
					But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1011
			-
				-
					To better hopes his more attentive mind
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1012
			-
				-
					Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1013
			-
				-
					Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1014
			-
				-
					To argue in thee something more sublime
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1015
			-
				-
					And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1016
			-
				-
					But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1017
			-
				-
					That excellence thought in thee; and implies,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1018
			-
				-
					Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1019
			-
				-
					For loss of life and pleasure overloved.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1020
			-
				-
					Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1021
			-
				-
					Of misery, so thinking to evade
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1022
			-
				-
					The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1023
			-
				-
					Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1024
			-
				-
					To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1025
			-
				-
					So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1026
			-
				-
					We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1027
			-
				-
					Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1028
			-
				-
					To make death in us live: Then let us seek
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1029
			-
				-
					Some safer resolution, which methinks
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1030
			-
				-
					I have in view, calling to mind with heed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1031
			-
				-
					Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1032
			-
				-
					The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1033
			-
				-
					Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1034
			-
				-
					Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1035
			-
				-
					Against us this deceit: To crush his head
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1036
			-
				-
					Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1037
			-
				-
					By death brought on ourselves, or childless days
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1038
			-
				-
					Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1039
			-
				-
					Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1040
			-
				-
					Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1041
			-
				-
					No more be mentioned then of violence
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1042
			-
				-
					Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1043
			-
				-
					That cuts us off from hope; and savours only
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1044
			-
				-
					Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1045
			-
				-
					Reluctance against God and his just yoke

					And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1048
			-
				-
					Without wrath or reviling; we expected
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1049
			-
				-
					Immediate dissolution, which we thought
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1050
			-

					Was meant by death that day; when lo! to thee
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1051
			-

					Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,

					Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn

				Book 10: Line 1055

					Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;

					The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
				-

					To show us in this mountain; while the winds

				Book 10: Line 1066

				-
					Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks

			-
				Book 10: Line 1067

				Book 10: Line 1069

					Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams

				Book 10: Line 1076
			-
				-
					Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1077

					And sends a comfortable heat from far,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1078

					Which might supply the sun: Such fire to use,

			-
				-
					To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1081
			-

					He will instruct us praying, and of grace
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1082
			-
				-
					Beseeching him; so as we need not fear
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1083
			-
				-
					To pass commodiously this life, sustained
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1084
			-
				-
					By him with many comforts, till we end
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1085
			-
				-
					In dust, our final rest and native home.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1086
			-
				-
					What better can we do, than, to the place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1087
			-
				-
					Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1088
			-
				-
					Before him reverent; and there confess
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1089
			-
				-
					Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1090
			-
				-
					Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1091
			-
				-
					Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1092
			-
				-
					Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1093
			-
				-
					Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1094
			-
				-
					From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1095
			-
				-
					When angry most he seemed and most severe,
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1096
			-
				-
					What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1097
			-
				-
					So spake our father penitent; nor Eve
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1098
			-
				-
					Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1099
			-
				-
					Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1100
			-
				-
					Before him reverent; and both confessed
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1101
			-
				-
					Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1102
			-
				-
					Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air
				-
			-
				Book 10: Line 1103
			-
				-
					Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign

					Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 2
			-
				-
					Praying; for from the mercy-seat above
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 3
			-
				-
					Prevenient grace descending had removed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 4
			-
				-
					The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 5
			-
				-
					Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 6
			-
				-
					Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 7
			-
				-
					Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 8
			-
				-
					Than loudest oratory: Yet their port
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 9
			-
				-
					Not of mean suitors; nor important less
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 10
			-
				-
					Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 11
			-
				-
					In fables old, less ancient yet than these,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 12
			-
				-
					Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 13
			-
				-
					The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 14
			-
				-
					Of Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 15
			-
				-
					Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 16
			-
				-
					Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 17
			-
				-
					Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 18
			-
				-
					With incense, where the golden altar fumed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 19
			-
				-
					By their great intercessour, came in sight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 20
			-
				-
					Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 21
			-
				-
					Presenting, thus to intercede began.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 22
			-
				-
					See Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 23
			-
				-
					From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 24
			-
				-
					And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 25
			-
				-
					With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 26
			-
				-
					Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 27
			-
				-
					Sown with contrition in his heart, than those
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 28
			-
				-
					Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 29
			-
				-
					Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 30
			-
				-
					From innocence. Now therefore, bend thine ear
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 31
			-
				-
					To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 32
			-
				-
					Unskilful with what words to pray, let me
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 33
			-
				-
					Interpret for him; me, his advocate
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 34
			-
				-
					And propitiation; all his works on me,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 35
			-
				-
					Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 36
			-
				-
					Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 37
			-
				-
					Accept me; and, in me, from these receive
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 38
			-
				-
					The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 39
			-
				-
					Before thee reconciled, at least his days
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 40
			-
				-
					Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 41
			-
				-
					To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 42
			-
				-
					To better life shall yield him: where with me
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 43
			-
				-
					All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 44
			-
				-
					Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 45
			-
				-
					To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 46
			-
				-
					All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 47
			-
				-
					Obtain; all thy request was my decree:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 48
			-
				-
					But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 49
			-
				-
					The law I gave to Nature him forbids:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 50
			-
				-
					Those pure immortal elements, that know,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 51
			-
				-
					No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 52
			-
				-
					Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 53
			-
				-
					As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 54
			-
				-
					And mortal food; as may dispose him best
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 55
			-
				-
					For dissolution wrought by sin, that first
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 56
			-
				-
					Distempered all things, and of incorrupt
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 57
			-
				-
					Corrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 58
			-
				-
					Created him endowed; with happiness,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 59
			-
				-
					And immortality: that fondly lost,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 60
			-
				-
					This other served but to eternize woe;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 61
			-
				-
					Till I provided death: so death becomes
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 62
			-
				-
					His final remedy; and, after life,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 63
			-
				-
					Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 64
			-
				-
					By faith and faithful works, to second life,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 65
			-
				-
					Waked in the renovation of the just,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 66
			-
				-
					Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 67
			-
				-
					But let us call to synod all the Blest,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 68
			-
				-
					Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 69
			-
				-
					My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 70
			-
				-
					As how with peccant Angels late they saw,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 71
			-
				-
					And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 72
			-
				-
					He ended, and the Son gave signal high
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 73
			-
				-
					To the bright minister that watched; he blew
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 74
			-
				-
					His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 75
			-
				-
					When God descended, and perhaps once more
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 76
			-
				-
					To sound at general doom. The angelick blast
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 77
			-
				-
					Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 78
			-
				-
					Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 79
			-
				-
					By the waters of life, where'er they sat
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 80
			-
				-
					In fellowships of joy, the sons of light
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 81
			-
				-
					Hasted, resorting to the summons high;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 82
			-
				-
					And took their seats; till from his throne supreme
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 83
			-
				-
					The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 84
			-
				-
					O Sons, like one of us Man is become
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 85
			-
				-
					To know both good and evil, since his taste
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 86
			-
				-
					Of that defended fruit; but let him boast
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 87
			-
				-
					His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 88
			-
				-
					Happier! had it sufficed him to have known
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 89
			-
				-
					Good by itself, and evil not at all.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 90
			-
				-
					He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 91
			-
				-
					My motions in him; longer than they move,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 92
			-
				-
					His heart I know, how variable and vain,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 93
			-
				-
					Self-left. Lest therefore his now bolder hand
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 94
			-
				-
					Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 95
			-
				-
					And live for ever, dream at least to live
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 96
			-
				-
					For ever, to remove him I decree,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 97
			-
				-
					And send him from the garden forth to till
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 98
			-
				-
					The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 99
			-
				-
					Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 100
			-
				-
					Take to thee from among the Cherubim
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 101
			-
				-
					Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 102
			-
				-
					Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 103
			-
				-
					Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 104
			-
				-
					Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 105
			-
				-
					Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 106
			-
				-
					From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 107
			-
				-
					To them, and to their progeny, from thence
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 108
			-
				-
					Perpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 109
			-
				-
					At the sad sentence rigorously urged,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 110
			-
				-
					(For I behold them softened, and with tears
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 111
			-
				-
					Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 112
			-
				-
					If patiently thy bidding they obey,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 113
			-
				-
					Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 114
			-
				-
					To Adam what shall come in future days,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 115
			-
				-
					As I shall thee enlighten; intermix
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 116
			-
				-
					My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 117
			-
				-
					So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 118
			-
				-
					And on the east side of the garden place,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 119
			-
				-
					Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 120
			-
				-
					Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 121
			-
				-
					Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 122
			-
				-
					And guard all passage to the tree of life:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 123
			-
				-
					Lest Paradise a receptacle prove
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 124
			-
				-
					To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 125
			-
				-
					With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 126
			-
				-
					He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 127
			-
				-
					For swift descent; with him the cohort bright
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 128
			-
				-
					Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 129
			-
				-
					Had, like a double Janus; all their shape
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 130
			-
				-
					Spangled with eyes more numerous than those
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 131
			-
				-
					Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 132
			-
				-
					Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 133
			-
				-
					Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Mean while,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 134
			-
				-
					To re-salute the world with sacred light,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 135
			-
				-
					Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 136
			-
				-
					The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 137
			-
				-
					Had ended now their orisons, and found
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 138
			-
				-
					Strength added from above; new hope to spring
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 139
			-
				-
					Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 140
			-
				-
					Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 141
			-
				-
					Eve, easily my faith admit, that all
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 142
			-
				-
					The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 143
			-
				-
					But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 144
			-
				-
					So prevalent as to concern the mind
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 145
			-
				-
					Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 146
			-
				-
					Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 147
			-
				-
					Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 148
			-
				-
					Even to the seat of God. For since I sought
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 149
			-
				-
					By prayer the offended Deity to appease;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 150
			-
				-
					Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 151
			-
				-
					Methought I saw him placable and mild,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 152
			-
				-
					Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 153
			-
				-
					That I was heard with favour; peace returned
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 154
			-
				-
					Home to my breast, and to my memory
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 155
			-
				-
					His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 156
			-
				-
					Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 157
			-
				-
					Assures me that the bitterness of death
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 158
			-
				-
					Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 159
			-
				-
					Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 160
			-
				-
					Mother of all things living, since by thee
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 161
			-
				-
					Man is to live; and all things live for Man.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 162
			-
				-
					To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 163
			-
				-
					Ill-worthy I such title should belong
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 164
			-
				-
					To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 165
			-
				-
					A help, became thy snare; to me reproach
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 166
			-
				-
					Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 167
			-
				-
					But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 168
			-
				-
					That I, who first brought death on all, am graced
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 169
			-
				-
					The source of life; next favourable thou,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 170
			-
				-
					Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 171
			-
				-
					Far other name deserving. But the field
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 172
			-
				-
					To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 173
			-
				-
					Though after sleepless night; for see! the morn,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 174
			-
				-
					All unconcerned with our unrest, begins
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 175
			-
				-
					Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 176
			-
				-
					I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 177
			-
				-
					Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 178
			-
				-
					Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 179
			-
				-
					What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 180
			-
				-
					Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 181
			-
				-
					So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 182
			-
				-
					Subscribed not: Nature first gave signs, impressed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 183
			-
				-
					On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 184
			-
				-
					After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 185
			-
				-
					The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 186
			-
				-
					Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 187
			-
				-
					Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 188
			-
				-
					First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 189
			-
				-
					Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 190
			-
				-
					Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 191
			-
				-
					Adam observed, and with his eye the chase
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 192
			-
				-
					Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 193
			-
				-
					O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 194
			-
				-
					Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 195
			-
				-
					Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 196
			-
				-
					Us, haply too secure, of our discharge
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 197
			-
				-
					From penalty, because from death released
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 198
			-
				-
					Some days: how long, and what till then our life,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 199
			-
				-
					Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 200
			-
				-
					And thither must return, and be no more?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 201
			-
				-
					Why else this double object in our sight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 202
			-
				-
					Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 203
			-
				-
					One way the self-same hour? why in the east
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 204
			-
				-
					Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 205
			-
				-
					More orient in yon western cloud, that draws
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 206
			-
				-
					O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 207
			-
				-
					And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 208
			-
				-
					He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 209
			-
				-
					Down from a sky of jasper lighted now
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 210
			-
				-
					In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 211
			-
				-
					A glorious apparition, had not doubt
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 212
			-
				-
					And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 213
			-
				-
					Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 214
			-
				-
					Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 215
			-
				-
					The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 216
			-
				-
					Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 217
			-
				-
					In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 218
			-
				-
					Against the Syrian king, who to surprise
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 219
			-
				-
					One man, assassin-like, had levied war,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 220
			-
				-
					War unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 221
			-
				-
					In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 222
			-
				-
					Possession of the garden; he alone,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 223
			-
				-
					To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 224
			-
				-
					Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 225
			-
				-
					While the great visitant approached, thus spake.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 226
			-
				-
					Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 227
			-
				-
					Of us will soon determine, or impose
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 228
			-
				-
					New laws to be observed; for I descry,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 229
			-
				-
					From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 230
			-
				-
					One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 231
			-
				-
					None of the meanest; some great Potentate
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 232
			-
				-
					Or of the Thrones above; such majesty
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 233
			-
				-
					Invests him coming! yet not terrible,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 234
			-
				-
					That I should fear; nor sociably mild,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 235
			-
				-
					As Raphael, that I should much confide;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 236
			-
				-
					But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 237
			-
				-
					With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 238
			-
				-
					He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 239
			-
				-
					Not in his shape celestial, but as man
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 240
			-
				-
					Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 241
			-
				-
					A military vest of purple flowed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 242
			-
				-
					Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 243
			-
				-
					Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 244
			-
				-
					In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 245
			-
				-
					His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 246
			-
				-
					In manhood where youth ended; by his side,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 247
			-
				-
					As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 248
			-
				-
					Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 249
			-
				-
					Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 250
			-
				-
					Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 251
			-
				-
					Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 252
			-
				-
					Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 253
			-
				-
					Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 254
			-
				-
					Defeated of his seisure many days
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 255
			-
				-
					Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 256
			-
				-
					And one bad act with many deeds well done
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 257
			-
				-
					Mayest cover: Well may then thy Lord, appeased,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 258
			-
				-
					Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 259
			-
				-
					But longer in this Paradise to dwell
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 260
			-
				-
					Permits not: to remove thee I am come,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 261
			-
				-
					And send thee from the garden forth to till
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 262
			-
				-
					The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 263
			-
				-
					He added not; for Adam at the news
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 264
			-
				-
					Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 265
			-
				-
					That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 266
			-
				-
					Yet all had heard, with audible lament
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 267
			-
				-
					Discovered soon the place of her retire.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 268
			-
				-
					O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 269
			-
				-
					Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 270
			-
				-
					Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 271
			-
				-
					Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 272
			-
				-
					Quiet though sad, the respite of that day
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 273
			-
				-
					That must be mortal to us both. O flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 274
			-
				-
					That never will in other climate grow,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 275
			-
				-
					My early visitation, and my last
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 276
			-
				-
					At even, which I bred up with tender hand
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 277
			-
				-
					From the first opening bud, and gave ye names,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 278
			-
				-
					Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 279
			-
				-
					Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 280
			-
				-
					Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 281
			-
				-
					With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 282
			-
				-
					How shall I part, and whither wander down
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 283
			-
				-
					Into a lower world; to this obscure
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 284
			-
				-
					And wild, how shall we breathe in other air
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 285
			-
				-
					Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 286
			-
				-
					Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 287
			-
				-
					Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 288
			-
				-
					What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 289
			-
				-
					Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 290
			-
				-
					Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 291
			-
				-
					Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 292
			-
				-
					Where he abides, think there thy native soil.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 293
			-
				-
					Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 294
			-
				-
					Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 295
			-
				-
					To Michael thus his humble words addressed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 296
			-
				-
					Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 297
			-
				-
					Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 298
			-
				-
					Prince above princes! gently hast thou told
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 299
			-
				-
					Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 300
			-
				-
					And in performing end us; what besides
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 301
			-
				-
					Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 302
			-
				-
					Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 303
			-
				-
					Departure from this happy place, our sweet
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 304
			-
				-
					Recess, and only consolation left
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 305
			-
				-
					Familiar to our eyes! all places else
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 306
			-
				-
					Inhospitable appear, and desolate;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 307
			-
				-
					Nor knowing us, nor known: And, if by prayer
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 308
			-
				-
					Incessant I could hope to change the will
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 309
			-
				-
					Of Him who all things can, I would not cease
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 310
			-
				-
					To weary him with my assiduous cries:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 311
			-
				-
					But prayer against his absolute decree
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 312
			-
				-
					No more avails than breath against the wind,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 313
			-
				-
					Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 314
			-
				-
					Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 315
			-
				-
					This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 316
			-
				-
					As from his face I shall be hid, deprived
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 317
			-
				-
					His blessed countenance: Here I could frequent
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 318
			-
				-
					With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 319
			-
				-
					Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 320
			-
				-
					On this mount he appeared; under this tree
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 321
			-
				-
					Stood visible; among these pines his voice
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 322
			-
				-
					I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 323
			-
				-
					So many grateful altars I would rear
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 324
			-
				-
					Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 325
			-
				-
					Of lustre from the brook, in memory,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 326
			-
				-
					Or monument to ages; and theron
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 327
			-
				-
					Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 328
			-
				-
					In yonder nether world where shall I seek
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 329
			-
				-
					His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 330
			-
				-
					For though I fled him angry, yet recalled
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 331
			-
				-
					To life prolonged and promised race, I now
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 332
			-
				-
					Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 333
			-
				-
					Of glory; and far off his steps adore.

					Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 336
			-
				-
					Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 337
			-
				-
					Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 338
			-
				-
					Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 339
			-
				-
					All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 340
			-
				-
					No despicable gift; surmise not then
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 341
			-
				-
					His presence to these narrow bounds confined
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 342
			-
				-
					Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 343
			-
				-
					Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 344
			-
				-
					All generations; and had hither come
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 345
			-
				-
					From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 346
			-
				-
					And reverence thee, their great progenitor.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 347
			-
				-
					But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 348
			-
				-
					To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 349
			-
				-
					Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 350

					God is, as here; and will be found alike

			-
				Book 11: Line 351
			-
				-
					Present; and of his presence many a sign
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 352

					Still following thee, still compassing thee round

					Expect to hear; supernal grace contending
				-

				Book 11: Line 360

				-
					With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn

				Book 11: Line 361

					True patience, and to temper joy with fear

					Safest thy life, and best prepared endure

					Thy mortal passage when it comes. - Ascend

			-
				Book 11: Line 367
			-
				-
					This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 368
			-
				-
					Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 369
			-
				-
					As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 370

				-
					To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.

			-
				Book 11: Line 371
			-
				-
					Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 372
			-
				-
					Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 373
			-
				-
					However chastening; to the evil turn
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 374
			-
				-
					My obvious breast; arming to overcome
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 375
			-
				-
					By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 376
			-
				-
					If so I may attain. - So both ascend
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 377
			-
				-
					In the visions of God. It was a hill,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 378
			-
				-
					Of Paradise the highest; from whose top
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 379
			-
				-
					The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 380
			-
				-
					Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 381
			-
				-
					Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 382
			-
				-
					Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 383
			-
				-
					Our second Adam, in the wilderness;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 384
			-
				-
					To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 385

					His eye might there command wherever stood
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 386
			-
				-
					City of old or modern fame, the seat
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 387
			-
				-
					Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls
				-
			-

			-
				-
					Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,

					And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne,
				-
			-

					To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence
				-
			-

					Down to the golden Chersonese; or where

					The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,

					The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw

			-
				-
					Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 408

					Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons

				Book 11: Line 411
			-
				-
					Call El Dorado. But to nobler sights
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 412
			-
				-
					Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 413
			-
				-
					Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 414
			-
				-
					Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 415
			-
				-
					The visual nerve, for he had much to see;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 416
			-
				-
					And from the well of life three drops instilled.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 417
			-
				-
					So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 418
			-
				-
					Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 419
			-
				-
					That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 420
			-
				-
					Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 421
			-
				-
					But him the gentle Angel by the hand
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 422
			-
				-
					Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 423
			-
				-
					Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 424
			-
				-
					The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 425
			-
				-
					In some to spring from thee; who never touched
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 426
			-
				-
					The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 427
			-
				-
					Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 428
			-
				-
					Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 429
			-
				-
					His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 430
			-
				-
					Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 431
			-
				-
					New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 432
			-
				-
					I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 433
			-
				-
					Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 434
			-
				-
					A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 435
			-
				-
					First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 436
			-
				-
					Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 437
			-
				-
					More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 438
			-
				-
					Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 439
			-
				-
					The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 440
			-
				-
					On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 441
			-
				-
					His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 442
			-
				-
					Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 443
			-
				-
					The other's not, for his was not sincere;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 444
			-
				-
					Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 445
			-
				-
					Smote him into the midriff with a stone
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 446
			-
				-
					That beat out life; he fell; and, deadly pale,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 447
			-
				-
					Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 448
			-
				-
					Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 449
			-
				-
					Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 450
			-
				-
					O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 451
			-
				-
					To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 452
			-
				-
					Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 453
			-
				-
					To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 454
			-
				-
					These two are brethren, Adam, and to come
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 455
			-
				-
					Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 456
			-
				-
					For envy that his brother's offering found
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 457
			-
				-
					From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 458
			-
				-
					Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 459
			-
				-
					Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 460
			-
				-
					Rolling in dust and gore. To which our sire.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 461
			-
				-
					Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 462
			-
				-
					But have I now seen Death? Is this the way
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 463
			-
				-
					I must return to native dust? O sight
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 464
			-
				-
					Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 465
			-
				-
					Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 466
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 467
			-
				-
					In his first shape on Man; but many shapes
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 468
			-
				-
					Of Death, and many are the ways that lead
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 469
			-
				-
					To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 470
			-
				-
					More terrible at the entrance, than within.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 471
			-
				-
					Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 472
			-
				-
					By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 473
			-
				-
					In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 474
			-
				-
					Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 475
			-
				-
					Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 476
			-
				-
					What misery the inabstinence of Eve
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 477
			-
				-
					Shall bring on Men. Immediately a place
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 478
			-
				-
					Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 479
			-
				-
					A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 480
			-
				-
					Numbers of all diseased; all maladies
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 481
			-
				-
					Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 482
			-
				-
					Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 483
			-
				-
					Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 484
			-
				-
					Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 485
			-
				-
					Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 486
			-
				-
					And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 487
			-
				-
					Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 488
			-
				-
					Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 489
			-
				-
					Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 490
			-
				-
					Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 491
			-
				-
					And over them triumphant Death his dart
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 492
			-
				-
					Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 493
			-
				-
					With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 494
			-
				-
					Sight so deform what heart of rock could long
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 495
			-
				-
					Dry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 496
			-
				-
					Though not of woman born; compassion quelled
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 497
			-
				-
					His best of man, and gave him up to tears
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 498
			-
				-
					A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 499
			-
				-
					And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 500
			-
				-
					O miserable mankind, to what fall
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 501
			-
				-
					Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 502
			-
				-
					Better end here unborn. Why is life given
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 503
			-
				-
					To be thus wrested from us? rather, why
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 504
			-
				-
					Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 505
			-
				-
					What we receive, would either not accept
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 506
			-
				-
					Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 507
			-
				-
					Glad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 508
			-
				-
					The image of God in Man, created once
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 509
			-
				-
					So goodly and erect, though faulty since,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 510
			-
				-
					To such unsightly sufferings be debased
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 511
			-
				-
					Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 512
			-
				-
					Retaining still divine similitude
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 513
			-
				-
					In part, from such deformities be free,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 514
			-
				-
					And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 515
			-
				-
					Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 516
			-
				-
					Forsook them, when themselves they vilified
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 517
			-
				-
					To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 518
			-
				-
					His image whom they served, a brutish vice,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 519
			-
				-
					Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 520
			-
				-
					Therefore so abject is their punishment,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 521
			-
				-
					Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 522
			-
				-
					Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 523
			-
				-
					While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 524
			-
				-
					To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 525
			-
				-
					God's image did not reverence in themselves.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 526
			-
				-
					I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 527
			-
				-
					But is there yet no other way, besides
				-
			-

					These painful passages, how we may come
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 529
			-
				-
					To death, and mix with our connatural dust?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 530

				-
					There is, said Michael, if thou well observe
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 531
			-
				-
					The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 532
			-
				-
					In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 533
			-
				-
					Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 534
			-
				-
					Till many years over thy head return:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 535
			-
				-
					So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 536
			-
				-
					Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 537
			-
				-
					Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 538
			-
				-
					This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 539
			-
				-
					Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 540
			-
				-
					To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 541
			-
				-
					Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 542
			-
				-
					To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 543
			-
				-
					Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 544
			-
				-
					A melancholy damp of cold and dry
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 545
			-
				-
					To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 546
			-
				-
					The balm of life. To whom our ancestor.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 547
			-
				-
					Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong

				Book 11: Line 548
			-
				-
					Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 549
			-
				-
					Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 550
			-
				-
					Which I must keep till my appointed day
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 551
			-

					Of rendering up, and patiently attend
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 552
			-
				-
					My dissolution. Michael replied.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 553
			-
				-
					Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 554
			-
				-
					Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 555
			-
				-
					And now prepare thee for another sight.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 556
			-
				-
					He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 557
			-
				-
					Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 558
			-
				-
					Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 559
			-
				-
					Of instruments, that made melodious chime,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 560
			-
				-
					Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 561
			-
				-
					Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 562
			-
				-
					Instinct through all proportions, low and high,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 563
			-
				-
					Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 564
			-
				-
					In other part stood one who, at the forge
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 565
			-
				-
					Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 566
			-
				-
					Had melted, (whether found where casual fire
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 567
			-
				-
					Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 568
			-
				-
					Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 569
			-
				-
					To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 570
			-
				-
					From underground;) the liquid ore he drained
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 571
			-
				-
					Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 572
			-
				-
					First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 573
			-
				-
					Fusil or graven in metal. After these,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 574
			-
				-
					But on the hither side, a different sort
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 575
			-
				-
					From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 576
			-
				-
					Down to the plain descended; by their guise
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 577
			-
				-
					Just men they seemed, and all their study bent
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 578
			-
				-
					To worship God aright, and know his works
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 579
			-
				-
					Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 580
			-
				-
					Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 581
			-
				-
					Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 582
			-
				-
					A bevy of fair women, richly gay
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 583
			-
				-
					In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 584
			-
				-
					Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 585
			-
				-
					The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 586
			-
				-
					Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 587
			-
				-
					Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 588
			-
				-
					And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 589
			-
				-
					Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 590
			-
				-
					They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 591
			-
				-
					Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 592
			-
				-
					With feast and musick all the tents resound.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 593
			-
				-
					Such happy interview, and fair event
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 594
			-
				-
					Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 595
			-
				-
					And charming symphonies, attached the heart
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 596
			-
				-
					Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 597
			-
				-
					The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 598
			-
				-
					True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 599
			-
				-
					Much better seems this vision, and more hope
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 600
			-
				-
					Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 601
			-
				-
					Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 602
			-
				-
					Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 603
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. Judge not what is best
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 604
			-
				-
					By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 605
			-
				-
					Created, as thou art, to nobler end
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 606
			-
				-
					Holy and pure, conformity divine.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 607
			-
				-
					Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 608
			-
				-
					Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 609
			-
				-
					Who slew his brother; studious they appear
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 610
			-
				-
					Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 611
			-
				-
					Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 612
			-
				-
					Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 613
			-
				-
					Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 614
			-
				-
					For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 615
			-
				-
					Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 616
			-
				-
					Yet empty of all good wherein consists
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 617
			-
				-
					Woman's domestick honour and chief praise;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 618
			-
				-
					Bred only and completed to the taste
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 619
			-
				-
					Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 620
			-
				-
					To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 621
			-
				-
					To these that sober race of men, whose lives
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 622
			-
				-
					Religious titled them the sons of God,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 623
			-
				-
					Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 624
			-
				-
					Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 625
			-
				-
					Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 626
			-
				-
					Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 627
			-
				-
					The world erelong a world of tears must weep.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 628
			-
				-
					To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 629
			-
				-
					O pity and shame, that they, who to live well
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 630
			-
				-
					Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 631
			-
				-
					Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 632
			-
				-
					But still I see the tenour of Man's woe
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 633
			-
				-
					Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 634
			-
				-
					From Man's effeminate slackness it begins,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 635
			-
				-
					Said the Angel, who should better hold his place
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 636
			-
				-
					By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 637
			-
				-
					But now prepare thee for another scene.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 638
			-
				-
					He looked, and saw wide territory spread
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 639
			-
				-
					Before him, towns, and rural works between;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 640
			-
				-
					Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 641
			-
				-
					Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 642
			-
				-
					Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 643
			-
				-
					Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 644
			-
				-
					Single or in array of battle ranged
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 645
			-
				-
					Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 646
			-
				-
					One way a band select from forage drives
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 647
			-
				-
					A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 648
			-
				-
					From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 649
			-
				-
					Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 650
			-
				-
					Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 651
			-
				-
					But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 652
			-
				-
					With cruel tournament the squadrons join;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 653
			-
				-
					Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 654
			-
				-
					With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 655
			-
				-
					Deserted: Others to a city strong
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 656
			-
				-
					Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 657
			-
				-
					Assaulting; others from the wall defend
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 658
			-
				-
					With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 659
			-
				-
					On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 660
			-
				-
					In other part the sceptered heralds call
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 661
			-
				-
					To council, in the city-gates; anon
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 662
			-
				-
					Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 663
			-
				-
					Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 664
			-
				-
					In factious opposition; till at last,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 665
			-
				-
					Of middle age one rising, eminent
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 666
			-
				-
					In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 667
			-
				-
					Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 668
			-
				-
					And judgement from above: him old and young
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 669
			-
				-
					Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 670
			-
				-
					Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 671
			-
				-
					Unseen amid the throng: so violence
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 672
			-
				-
					Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 673
			-
				-
					Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 674
			-
				-
					Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 675
			-
				-
					Lamenting turned full sad; O! what are these,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 676
			-
				-
					Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 677
			-
				-
					Inhumanly to men, and multiply
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 678
			-
				-
					Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 679
			-
				-
					His brother: for of whom such massacre
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 680
			-
				-
					Make they, but of their brethren; men of men
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 681
			-
				-
					But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 682
			-
				-
					Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 683
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. These are the product
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 684
			-
				-
					Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 685
			-
				-
					Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 686
			-
				-
					Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 687
			-
				-
					Produce prodigious births of body or mind.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 688
			-
				-
					Such were these giants, men of high renown;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 689
			-
				-
					For in those days might only shall be admired,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 690
			-
				-
					And valour and heroick virtue called;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 691
			-
				-
					To overcome in battle, and subdue
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 692
			-
				-
					Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 693
			-
				-
					Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 694
			-
				-
					Of human glory; and for glory done
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 695
			-
				-
					Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 696
			-
				-
					Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 697
			-
				-
					Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 698
			-
				-
					Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 699
			-
				-
					And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 700
			-
				-
					But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 701
			-
				-
					The only righteous in a world preverse,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 702
			-
				-
					And therefore hated, therefore so beset
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 703
			-
				-
					With foes, for daring single to be just,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 704
			-
				-
					And utter odious truth, that God would come
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 705
			-
				-
					To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 706
			-
				-
					Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 707
			-
				-
					Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 708
			-
				-
					High in salvation and the climes of bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 709
			-
				-
					Exempt from death; to show thee what reward
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 710
			-
				-
					Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 711
			-
				-
					Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 712
			-
				-
					He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 713
			-
				-
					The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 714
			-
				-
					All now was turned to jollity and game,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 715
			-
				-
					To luxury and riot, feast and dance;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 716
			-
				-
					Marrying or prostituting, as befel,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 717
			-
				-
					Rape or adultery, where passing fair
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 718
			-
				-
					Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 719
			-
				-
					At length a reverend sire among them came,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 720
			-
				-
					And of their doings great dislike declared,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 721
			-
				-
					And testified against their ways; he oft
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 722
			-
				-
					Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 723
			-
				-
					Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 724
			-
				-
					Conversion and repentance, as to souls
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 725
			-
				-
					In prison, under judgements imminent:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 726
			-
				-
					But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 727
			-
				-
					Contending, and removed his tents far off;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 728
			-
				-
					Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 729
			-
				-
					Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 730
			-
				-
					Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 731
			-
				-
					Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 732
			-
				-
					Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 733
			-
				-
					For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 734
			-
				-
					Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 735
			-
				-
					Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 736
			-
				-
					Their order: last the sire and his three sons,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 737
			-
				-
					With their four wives; and God made fast the door.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 738
			-
				-
					Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 739
			-
				-
					Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 740
			-
				-
					From under Heaven; the hills to their supply
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 741
			-
				-
					Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 742
			-
				-
					Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 743
			-
				-
					Like a dark ceiling stood; down rushed the rain
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 744
			-
				-
					Impetuous; and continued, till the earth
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 745
			-
				-
					No more was seen: the floating vessel swum
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 746
			-
				-
					Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 747
			-
				-
					Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 748
			-
				-
					Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 749
			-
				-
					Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 750
			-
				-
					Sea without shore; and in their palaces,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 751
			-
				-
					Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 752
			-
				-
					And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 753
			-
				-
					All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 754
			-
				-
					How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 755
			-
				-
					The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 756
			-
				-
					Depopulation! Thee another flood,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 757
			-
				-
					Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 758
			-
				-
					And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 759
			-
				-
					By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 760
			-
				-
					Though comfortless; as when a father mourns
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 761
			-
				-
					His children, all in view destroyed at once;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 762
			-
				-
					And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 763
			-
				-
					O visions ill foreseen! Better had I
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 764
			-
				-
					Lived ignorant of future! so had borne
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 765
			-
				-
					My part of evil only, each day's lot
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 766
			-
				-
					Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 767
			-
				-
					The burden of many ages, on me light
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 768
			-
				-
					At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 769
			-
				-
					Abortive, to torment me ere their being,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 770
			-
				-
					With thought that they must be. Let no man seek
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 771
			-
				-
					Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 772
			-
				-
					Him or his children; evil he may be sure,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 773
			-
				-
					Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 774
			-
				-
					And he the future evil shall no less
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 775
			-
				-
					In apprehension than in substance feel,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 776
			-
				-
					Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 777
			-
				-
					Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 778
			-
				-
					Famine and anguish will at last consume,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 779
			-
				-
					Wandering that watery desart: I had hope,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 780
			-
				-
					When violence was ceased, and war on earth,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 781
			-
				-
					All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 782
			-
				-
					With length of happy days the race of Man;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 783
			-
				-
					But I was far deceived; for now I see
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 784
			-
				-
					Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 785
			-
				-
					How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 786
			-
				-
					And whether here the race of Man will end.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 787
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. Those, whom last thou sawest
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 788
			-
				-
					In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 789
			-
				-
					First seen in acts of prowess eminent
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 790
			-
				-
					And great exploits, but of true virtue void;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 791
			-
				-
					Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 792
			-
				-
					Subduing nations, and achieved thereby
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 793
			-
				-
					Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 794
			-
				-
					Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 795
			-
				-
					Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 796
			-
				-
					Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 797
			-
				-
					The conquered also, and enslaved by war,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 798
			-
				-
					Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 799
			-
				-
					And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 800
			-
				-
					In sharp contest of battle found no aid
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 801
			-
				-
					Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 802
			-
				-
					Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 803
			-
				-
					Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 804
			-
				-
					Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 805
			-
				-
					More than enough, that temperance may be tried:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 806
			-
				-
					So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 807
			-
				-
					Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 808
			-
				-
					One man except, the only son of light
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 809
			-
				-
					In a dark age, against example good,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 810
			-
				-
					Against allurement, custom, and a world
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 811
			-
				-
					Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 812
			-
				-
					Or violence, he of their wicked ways
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 813
			-
				-
					Shall them admonish; and before them set
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 814
			-
				-
					The paths of righteousness, how much more safe
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 815
			-
				-
					And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 816
			-
				-
					On their impenitence; and shall return
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 817
			-
				-
					Of them derided, but of God observed
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 818
			-
				-
					The one just man alive; by his command
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 819
			-
				-
					Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 820
			-
				-
					To save himself, and houshold, from amidst
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 821
			-
				-
					A world devote to universal wrack.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 822
			-
				-
					No sooner he, with them of man and beast
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 823
			-
				-
					Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 824
			-
				-
					And sheltered round; but all the cataracts
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 825
			-
				-
					Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 826
			-
				-
					Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 827
			-
				-
					Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 828
			-
				-
					Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 829
			-
				-
					Above the highest hills: Then shall this mount
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 830
			-
				-
					Of Paradise by might of waves be moved
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 831
			-
				-
					Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 832
			-
				-
					With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 833
			-
				-
					Down the great river to the opening gulf,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 834
			-
				-
					And there take root an island salt and bare,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 835
			-
				-
					The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 836
			-
				-
					To teach thee that God attributes to place
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 837
			-
				-
					No sanctity, if none be thither brought
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 838
			-
				-
					By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 839
			-
				-
					And now, what further shall ensue, behold.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 840
			-
				-
					He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 841
			-
				-
					Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 842
			-
				-
					Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 843
			-
				-
					Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 844
			-
				-
					And the clear sun on his wide watery glass
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 845
			-
				-
					Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 846
			-
				-
					As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 847
			-
				-
					From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 848
			-
				-
					With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 849
			-
				-
					His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 850
			-
				-
					The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 851
			-
				-
					Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 852
			-
				-
					And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 853
			-
				-
					With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 854
			-
				-
					Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 855
			-
				-
					Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 856
			-
				-
					And after him, the surer messenger,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 857
			-
				-
					A dove sent forth once and again to spy
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 858
			-
				-
					Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 859
			-
				-
					The second time returning, in his bill
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 860
			-
				-
					An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 861
			-
				-
					Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 862
			-
				-
					The ancient sire descends, with all his train;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 863
			-
				-
					Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 864
			-
				-
					Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 865
			-
				-
					A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 866
			-
				-
					Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 867
			-
				-
					Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 868
			-
				-
					Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 869
			-
				-
					Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 870
			-
				-
					O thou, who future things canst represent
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 871
			-
				-
					As present, heavenly Instructer! I revive
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 872
			-
				-
					At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 873
			-
				-
					With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 874
			-
				-
					Far less I now lament for one whole world
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 875
			-
				-
					Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 876
			-
				-
					For one man found so perfect, and so just,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 877
			-
				-
					That God vouchsafes to raise another world
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 878
			-
				-
					From him, and all his anger to forget.
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 879
			-
				-
					But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 880
			-
				-
					Distended, as the brow of God appeased?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 881
			-
				-
					Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 882
			-
				-
					The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 883
			-
				-
					Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 884
			-
				-
					To whom the Arch-Angel. Dextrously thou aimest;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 885
			-
				-
					So willingly doth God remit his ire,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 886
			-
				-
					Though late repenting him of Man depraved;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 887
			-
				-
					Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 888
			-
				-
					The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 889
			-
				-
					Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 890
			-
				-
					Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 891
			-
				-
					That he relents, not to blot out mankind;
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 892
			-
				-
					And makes a covenant never to destroy
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 893
			-
				-
					The earth again by flood; nor let the sea
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 894
			-
				-
					Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 895
			-
				-
					With man therein or beast; but, when he brings
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 896
			-
				-
					Over the earth a cloud, will therein set
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 897
			-
				-
					His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 898
			-
				-
					And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 899
			-
				-
					Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 900
			-
				-
					Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,
				-
			-
				Book 11: Line 901
			-
				-
					Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
				-
		-
			Book 12
		-
			-
				Book 12: Line 1
			-
				-
					As one who in his journey bates at noon,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 2
			-
				-
					Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 3
			-
				-
					Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 4
			-
				-
					If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 5
			-
				-
					Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 6
			-
				-
					Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 7
			-
				-
					And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 8
			-
				-
					Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 9
			-
				-
					Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 10
			-
				-
					Must needs impair and weary human sense:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 11
			-
				-
					Henceforth what is to come I will relate;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 12
			-
				-
					Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 13
			-
				-
					This second source of Men, while yet but few,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 14
			-
				-
					And while the dread of judgement past remains
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 15
			-
				-
					Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,
				-
			-

				Book 12: Line 83
			-

					Since thy original lapse, true liberty

			-
				-
					From reason; and to servitude reduce
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 90
			-

					Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits

			-
				Book 12: Line 91
			-
				-
					Within himself unworthy powers to reign
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 92
			-
				-
					Over free reason, God, in judgement just,

					Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
				-

				Book 12: Line 95
			-

					His outward freedom: Tyranny must be;

				Book 12: Line 96
			-

					Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 97

					Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 98
			-
				-
					From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 99
			-
				-
					But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 100
			-
				-
					Deprives them of their outward liberty;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 101
			-
				-
					Their inward lost: Witness the irreverent son
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 102
			-
				-
					Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 103
			-
				-
					Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 104
			-
				-
					Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 105
			-
				-
					Thus will this latter, as the former world,

			-
				Book 12: Line 106
			-
				-
					Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 107
			-
				-
					Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 108
			-

					His presence from among them, and avert

				Book 12: Line 109
			-
				-
					His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 110
			-
				-
					To leave them to their own polluted ways;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 111

				Book 12: Line 112
			-
				-
					From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 113
			-
				-
					A nation from one faithful man to spring:

			-
				Book 12: Line 114
			-
				-
					Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 115
			-
				-
					Bred up in idol-worship: O, that men
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 116
			-
				-
					(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 117
			-
				-
					While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 118
			-
				-
					As to forsake the living God, and fall
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 119
			-
				-
					To worship their own work in wood and stone
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 120
			-
				-
					For Gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 121
			-
				-
					To call by vision, from his father's house,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 122
			-
				-
					His kindred, and false Gods, into a land
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 123
			-
				-
					Which he will show him; and from him will raise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 124
			-
				-
					A mighty nation; and upon him shower
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 125
			-
				-
					His benediction so, that in his seed
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 126
			-
				-
					All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 127
			-
				-
					Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 128
			-
				-
					I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 129
			-
				-
					He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 130
			-
				-
					Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 131
			-
				-
					To Haran; after him a cumbrous train
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 132
			-
				-
					Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 133
			-
				-
					Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 134
			-
				-
					With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 135
			-
				-
					Canaan he now attains; I see his tents
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 136
			-
				-
					Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 137
			-
				-
					Of Moreh; there by promise he receives
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 138
			-
				-
					Gift to his progeny of all that land,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 139

					From Hameth northward to the Desart south;

			-
				-
					(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 141

					From Hermon east to the great western Sea;

					Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 143
			-
				-
					In prospect, as I point them; on the shore

				Book 12: Line 145

					Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 146
			-

				Book 12: Line 147
			-
				-
					This ponder, that all nations of the earth

			-
				Book 12: Line 148
			-
				-
					Shall in his seed be blessed: By that seed

					Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 153

				-
					A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 154
			-

					The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 156

				Book 12: Line 159
			-
				-
					Into the sea. To sojourn in that land
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 160

					He comes, invited by a younger son

				Book 12: Line 164
			-
				-
					Growing into a nation, and now grown

			-
				Book 12: Line 166
			-
				-
					To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests

			-
				Book 12: Line 167
			-

					Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 168
			-
				-
					Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:

			-
				Book 12: Line 169
			-
				-
					Till by two brethren (these two brethren call

				Book 12: Line 170
			-

				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 171
			-
				-
					His people from enthralment, they return,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 172
			-
				-
					With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 173
			-

					But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 174
			-
				-
					To know their God, or message to regard,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 175
			-
				-
					Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 176
			-
				-
					To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 177
			-
				-
					Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 178
			-
				-
					With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;

			-
				Book 12: Line 179
			-
				-
					His cattle must of rot and murren die;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 180
			-
				-
					Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,

			-
				-
					And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 182

					Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,

				Book 12: Line 183

					What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,
				-
			-

			-
				-
					A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 186
			-
				-

			-
				Book 12: Line 187
			-
				-
					Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,

				Book 12: Line 188
			-

					Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;

				Book 12: Line 189
			-
				-
					Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 190

				Book 12: Line 193
			-

				Book 12: Line 194
			-
				-
					More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 195
			-
				-
					Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 196
			-

					Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 197

				-
					Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;

				Book 12: Line 203

				-
					By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;

				Book 12: Line 204
			-

					To guide them in their journey, and remove
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 205
			-
				-
					Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:

				Book 12: Line 206
			-

					All night he will pursue; but his approach
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 207
			-
				-
					Darkness defends between till morning watch;

			-
				-
					Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 209
			-
				-
					God looking forth will trouble all his host,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 210
			-
				-
					And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 211

				-
					Moses once more his potent rod extends
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 212

				Book 12: Line 271
			-
				-
					Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things

			-
				Book 12: Line 272
			-
				-
					Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 273
			-
				-
					Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 274
			-
				-
					Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 275
			-
				-
					Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 276
			-
				-
					Of me and all mankind: But now I see
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 277
			-
				-
					His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 278
			-
				-
					Favour unmerited by me, who sought

				Book 12: Line 279
			-
				-
					Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 280

			-
				-
					Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 282

				-
					So many and so various laws are given;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 283
			-
				-
					So many laws argue so many sins
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 284
			-
				-
					Among them; how can God with such reside?
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 285
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 286
			-
				-
					Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 287
			-
				-
					And therefore was law given them, to evince
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 288
			-
				-
					Their natural pravity, by stirring up
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 289
			-
				-
					Sin against law to fight: that when they see
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 290
			-
				-
					Law can discover sin, but not remove,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 291
			-
				-
					Save by those shadowy expiations weak,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 292
			-
				-
					The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 293
			-
				-
					Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 294
			-
				-
					Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 295
			-
				-
					To them by faith imputed, they may find
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 296
			-
				-
					Justification towards God, and peace
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 297
			-
				-
					Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 298
			-
				-
					Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 299
			-
				-
					Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 300

				Book 12: Line 301
			-
				-
					With purpose to resign them, in full time,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 302
			-
				-
					Up to a better covenant; disciplined
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 303
			-
				-
					From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 304

				-
					From imposition of strict laws to free

			-
				Book 12: Line 305
			-

					Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear

				Book 12: Line 306
			-
				-
					To filial; works of law to works of faith.
				-

				Book 12: Line 307

					And therefore shall not Moses, though of God

				-
					Highly beloved, being but the minister

				Book 12: Line 309

					But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 311
			-
				-
					His name and office bearing, who shall quell
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 312

				Book 12: Line 316

					Irrevocable, that his regal throne

				Book 12: Line 331

				Book 12: Line 332
			-
				-
					And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 333
			-
				-
					The clouded ark of God, till then in tents
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 334
			-
				-
					Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 335

			-
				Book 12: Line 336
			-
				-
					Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;

				Book 12: Line 337
			-
				-
					Whose foul idolatries, and other faults
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 338
			-
				-
					Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 339
			-
				-
					God, as to leave them, and expose their land,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 340
			-
				-
					Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 341
			-
				-
					With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 342
			-
				-
					To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 343
			-
				-
					Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 344
			-
				-
					There in captivity he lets them dwell
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 345
			-
				-
					The space of seventy years; then brings them back,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 346
			-
				-
					Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn

			-
				Book 12: Line 347
			-

					Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God
				-

				Book 12: Line 350
			-
				-
					They first re-edify; and for a while
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 351
			-
				-
					In mean estate live moderate; till, grown

			-
				Book 12: Line 352
			-

					In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;

				Book 12: Line 353

					But first among the priests dissention springs,

				Book 12: Line 354
			-
				-
					Men who attend the altar, and should most
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 355
			-
				-
					Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 356
			-
				-
					Upon the temple itself: at last they seise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 357
			-
				-
					The scepter, and regard not David's sons;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 358
			-
				-
					Then lose it to a stranger, that the true

			-
				Book 12: Line 359
			-
				-
					Anointed King Messiah might be born
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 360
			-
				-
					Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 361
			-
				-
					Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 362
			-
				-
					And guides the eastern sages, who inquire
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 363
			-
				-
					His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 364
			-
				-
					His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 365
			-
				-
					To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 366
			-
				-
					They gladly thither haste, and by a quire
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 367
			-
				-
					Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 368

					He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 373
			-
				-
					Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 374
			-
				-
					Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.

				Book 12: Line 376
			-
				-
					Of utmost hope! now clear I understand

				Book 12: Line 380
			-
				-
					High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins

					Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son

				-
					Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!

					Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.

			-
				Book 12: Line 386
			-
				-
					To whom thus Michael. Dream not of their fight,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 387
			-
				-
					As of a duel, or the local wounds
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 388
			-
				-
					Of head or heel: Not therefore joins the Son

			-
				Book 12: Line 389

				Book 12: Line 390

					Thy enemy; nor so is overcome

				Book 12: Line 391
			-
				-
					Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,

			-
				Book 12: Line 392
			-
				-
					Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 393
			-
				-
					Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 394
			-

					Not by destroying Satan, but his works

				Book 12: Line 405

					To a reproachful life, and cursed death;

				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 412
			-
				-
					Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 413
			-
				-
					A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 414
			-
				-
					By his own nation; slain for bringing life:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 415
			-
				-
					But to the cross he nails thy enemies,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 416
			-
				-
					The law that is against thee, and the sins
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 417
			-
				-
					Of all mankind, with him there crucified,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 418
			-
				-
					Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 419
			-
				-
					In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 420
			-
				-
					But soon revives; Death over him no power
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 421
			-
				-
					Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 422
			-
				-
					Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 423
			-
				-
					Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 424
			-
				-
					Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 425
			-
				-
					His death for Man, as many as offered life
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 426
			-
				-
					Neglect not, and the benefit embrace
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 427
			-
				-
					By faith not void of works: This God-like act
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 428
			-
				-
					Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 429
			-
				-
					In sin for ever lost from life; this act
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 430
			-
				-
					Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 431
			-
				-
					Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 432
			-
				-
					And fix far deeper in his head their stings
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 433
			-
				-
					Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 434
			-
				-
					Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 435
			-
				-
					A gentle wafting to immortal life.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 436
			-
				-
					Nor after resurrection shall he stay
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 437
			-
				-
					Longer on earth, than certain times to appear
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 438
			-
				-
					To his disciples, men who in his life
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 439
			-
				-
					Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 440
			-
				-
					To teach all nations what of him they learned
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 441
			-
				-
					And his salvation; them who shall believe
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 442
			-
				-
					Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 443
			-
				-
					Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 444
			-
				-
					Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 445
			-
				-
					For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 446
			-
				-
					All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 447
			-
				-
					Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 448
			-
				-
					Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 449
			-
				-
					Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 450
			-
				-
					So in his seed all nations shall be blest.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 451
			-
				-
					Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 452
			-
				-
					With victory, triumphing through the air
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 453
			-
				-
					Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 454
			-
				-
					The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 455
			-
				-
					Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 456
			-
				-
					Then enter into glory, and resume
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 457
			-
				-
					His seat at God's right hand, exalted high
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 458
			-
				-
					Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 459
			-
				-
					When this world's dissolution shall be ripe,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 460
			-
				-
					With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 461
			-
				-
					To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 462
			-
				-
					His faithful, and receive them into bliss,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 463
			-
				-
					Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 464
			-
				-
					Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 465
			-
				-
					Than this of Eden, and far happier days.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 466
			-
				-
					So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 467
			-
				-
					As at the world's great period; and our sire,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 468
			-
				-
					Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 469
			-
				-
					O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 470
			-
				-
					That all this good of evil shall produce,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 471
			-
				-
					And evil turn to good; more wonderful
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 472
			-
				-
					Than that which by creation first brought forth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 473
			-
				-
					Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 474
			-
				-
					Whether I should repent me now of sin
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 475
			-
				-
					By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 476
			-
				-
					Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 477
			-
				-
					To God more glory, more good-will to Men
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 478
			-
				-
					From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 479
			-
				-
					But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 480
			-
				-
					Must re-ascend, what will betide the few
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 481
			-
				-
					His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 482
			-
				-
					The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 483
			-
				-
					His people, who defend? Will they not deal
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 484
			-
				-
					Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 485
			-
				-
					Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 486
			-
				-
					He to his own a Comforter will send,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 487
			-
				-
					The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 488
			-
				-
					His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 489
			-
				-
					Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 490
			-
				-
					To guide them in all truth; and also arm
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 491
			-
				-
					With spiritual armour, able to resist
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 492
			-
				-
					Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 493
			-
				-
					What man can do against them, not afraid,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 494
			-
				-
					Though to the death; against such cruelties
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 495
			-
				-
					With inward consolations recompensed,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 496
			-
				-
					And oft supported so as shall amaze
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 497
			-
				-
					Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 498
			-
				-
					Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 499
			-
				-
					To evangelize the nations, then on all
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 500
			-
				-
					Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 501
			-
				-
					To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 502
			-
				-
					As did their Lord before them. Thus they win
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 503
			-
				-
					Great numbers of each nation to receive
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 504
			-
				-
					With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 505
			-
				-
					Their ministry performed, and race well run,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 506
			-
				-
					Their doctrine and their story written left,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 507
			-
				-
					They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 508
			-
				-
					Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 509
			-
				-
					Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 510
			-
				-
					To their own vile advantages shall turn
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 511
			-
				-
					Of lucre and ambition; and the truth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 512
			-
				-
					With superstitions and traditions taint,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 513
			-
				-
					Left only in those written records pure,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 514
			-
				-
					Though not but by the Spirit understood.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 515
			-
				-
					Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 516
			-
				-
					Places, and titles, and with these to join
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 517
			-
				-
					Secular power; though feigning still to act
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 518
			-
				-
					By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 519
			-
				-
					The Spirit of God, promised alike and given
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 520
			-
				-
					To all believers; and, from that pretence,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 521
			-
				-
					Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 522
			-
				-
					On every conscience; laws which none shall find
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 523
			-
				-
					Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 524
			-
				-
					Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 525
			-
				-
					But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 526
			-
				-
					His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 527
			-
				-
					His living temples, built by faith to stand,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 528
			-
				-
					Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 529
			-
				-
					Who against faith and conscience can be heard
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 530
			-
				-
					Infallible? yet many will presume:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 531
			-
				-
					Whence heavy persecution shall arise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 532
			-
				-
					On all, who in the worship persevere
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 533
			-
				-
					Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 534
			-
				-
					Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 535
			-
				-
					Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 536
			-
				-
					Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 537
			-
				-
					Rarely be found: So shall the world go on,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 538
			-
				-
					To good malignant, to bad men benign;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 539
			-
				-
					Under her own weight groaning; till the day
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 540
			-
				-
					Appear of respiration to the just,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 541
			-
				-
					And vengeance to the wicked, at return
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 542
			-
				-
					Of him so lately promised to thy aid,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 543
			-
				-
					The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 544
			-
				-
					Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 545
			-
				-
					Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 546
			-
				-
					In glory of the Father, to dissolve
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 547
			-
				-
					Satan with his perverted world; then raise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 548
			-
				-
					From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 549
			-
				-
					New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 550
			-
				-
					Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 551
			-
				-
					To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 552
			-
				-
					He ended; and thus Adam last replied.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 553
			-
				-
					How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 554
			-
				-
					Measured this transient world, the race of time,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 555
			-
				-
					Till time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 556
			-
				-
					Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 557
			-
				-
					Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 558
			-
				-
					Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 559
			-
				-
					Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 560
			-
				-
					Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 561
			-
				-
					Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 562
			-
				-
					And love with fear the only God; to walk
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 563
			-
				-
					As in his presence; ever to observe
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 564
			-
				-
					His providence; and on him sole depend,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 565
			-
				-
					Merciful over all his works, with good
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 566
			-
				-
					Still overcoming evil, and by small
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 567
			-
				-
					Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 568
			-
				-
					Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 569
			-
				-
					By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 570
			-
				-
					Is fortitude to highest victory,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 571
			-
				-
					And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 572
			-
				-
					Taught this by his example, whom I now
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 573
			-
				-
					Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 574
			-
				-
					To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 575
			-
				-
					This having learned, thou hast attained the sum
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 576
			-
				-
					Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 577
			-
				-
					Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 578
			-
				-
					All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 579
			-
				-
					Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 580
			-
				-
					And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 581
			-
				-
					And all the rule, one empire; only add
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 582
			-
				-
					Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 583
			-
				-
					Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 584
			-
				-
					By name to come called charity, the soul
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 585
			-
				-
					Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 586
			-
				-
					To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 587
			-
				-
					A Paradise within thee, happier far. -
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 588
			-
				-
					Let us descend now therefore from this top
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 589
			-
				-
					Of speculation; for the hour precise
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 590
			-
				-
					Exacts our parting hence; and see the guards,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 591
			-
				-
					By me encamped on yonder hill, expect
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 592
			-
				-
					Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 593
			-
				-
					In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 594
			-
				-
					We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 595
			-
				-
					Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 596
			-
				-
					Portending good, and all her spirits composed
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 597
			-
				-
					To meek submission: thou, at season fit,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 598
			-
				-
					Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 599
			-
				-
					Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 600
			-
				-
					The great deliverance by her seed to come
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 601
			-
				-
					(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 602
			-
				-
					That ye may live, which will be many days,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 603
			-
				-
					Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 604
			-
				-
					With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 605
			-
				-
					With meditation on the happy end.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 606
			-
				-
					He ended, and they both descend the hill;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 607
			-
				-
					Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve
				-
			-

					Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 609
			-
				-
					And thus with words not sad she him received.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 610
			-
				-
					Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 611
			-
				-
					For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 612
			-
				-
					Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 613
			-
				-
					Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 614
			-
				-
					Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 615
			-
				-
					In me is no delay; with thee to go,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 616
			-
				-
					Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 617
			-
				-
					Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 618
			-
				-
					Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 619
			-
				-
					Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 620
			-
				-
					This further consolation yet secure
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 621
			-
				-
					I carry hence; though all by me is lost,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 622
			-
				-
					Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 623
			-
				-
					By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 624

					So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 625
			-
				-
					Well pleased, but answered not: For now, too nigh
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 626
			-
				-
					The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 627
			-
				-
					To their fixed station, all in bright array
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 628
			-
				-
					The Cherubim descended; on the ground
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 629
			-
				-
					Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 630
			-
				-
					Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 631
			-
				-
					And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 632
			-
				-
					Homeward returning. High in front advanced,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 633
			-
				-
					The brandished sword of God before them blazed,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 634
			-
				-
					Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 635
			-
				-
					And vapour as the Libyan air adust,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 636
			-
				-
					Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 637
			-
				-
					In either hand the hastening Angel caught
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 638
			-
				-
					Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 639
			-
				-
					Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 640
			-
				-
					To the subjected plain; then disappeared.
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 641
			-
				-
					They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 642
			-
				-
					Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 643
			-
				-
					Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 644
			-
				-
					With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 645
			-
				-
					Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 646
			-
				-
					The world was all before them, where to choose
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 647
			-
				-
					Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 648
			-
				-
					They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,
				-
			-
				Book 12: Line 649
			-
				-
					Through Eden took their solitary way.
