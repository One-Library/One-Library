			Verse 1
		-
			-
				LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings
			-
		-
			Verse 2
		-
			-
				of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,
			-
		-
			Verse 3
		-
			-
				we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!
			-
		-
			Verse 4
		-
			-
				Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,
			-
		-
			Verse 5
		-
			-
				from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,
			-
		-
			Verse 6
		-
			-
				awing the earls. Since erst he lay
			-
		-
			Verse 7
		-
			-
				friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:
			-
		-
			Verse 8
		-
			-
				for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,
			-
		-
			Verse 9
		-
			-
				till before him the folk, both far and near,
			-
		-
			Verse 10
		-
			-
				who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,
			-
		-
			Verse 11
		-
			-
				gave him gifts: a good king he!
			-
		-
			Verse 12
		-
			-
				To him an heir was afterward born,
			-
		-
			Verse 13
		-
			-
				a son in his halls, whom heaven sent
			-
		-
			Verse 14
		-
			-
				to favor the folk, feeling their woe
			-
		-
			Verse 15
		-
			-
				that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
			-
		-
			Verse 16
		-
			-
				so long a while; the Lord endowed him,
			-
		-
			Verse 17
		-
			-
				the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.
			-
		-
			Verse 18
		-
			-
				Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him,
			-
		-
			Verse 19
		-
			-
				son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.
			-
		-
			Verse 20
		-
			-
				So becomes it a youth to quit him well
			-
		-
			Verse 21
		-
			-
				with his father's friends, by fee and gift,
			-
		-
			Verse 22
		-
			-
				that to aid him, aged, in after days,
			-
		-
			Verse 23
		-
			-
				come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,
			-
		-
			Verse 24
		-
			-
				liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds
			-
		-
			Verse 25
		-
			-
				shall an earl have honor in every clan.
			-
		-
			Verse 26
		-
			-
				Forth he fared at the fated moment,
			-
		-
			Verse 27
		-
			-
				sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.
			-
		-
			Verse 28
		-
			-
				Then they bore him over to ocean's billow,
			-
		-
			Verse 29
		-
			-
				loving clansmen, as late he charged them,
			-
		-
			Verse 30
		-
			-
				while wielded words the winsome Scyld,
			-
		-
			Verse 31
		-
			-
				the leader beloved who long had ruled....
			-
		-
			Verse 32
		-
			-
				In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,
			-
		-
			Verse 33
		-
			-
				ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge:
			-
		-
			Verse 34
		-
			-
				there laid they down their darling lord
			-
		-
			Verse 35
		-
			-
				on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,
			-
		-
			Verse 36
		-
			-
				by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure
			-
		-
			Verse 37
		-
			-
				fetched from far was freighted with him.
			-
		-
			Verse 38
		-
			-
				No ship have I known so nobly dight
			-
		-
			Verse 39
		-
			-
				with weapons of war and weeds of battle,
			-
		-
			Verse 40
		-
			-
				with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay
			-
		-
			Verse 41
		-
			-
				a heaped hoard that hence should go
			-
		-
			Verse 42
		-
			-
				far o'er the flood with him floating away.
			-
		-
			Verse 43
		-
			-
				No less these loaded the lordly gifts,
			-
		-
			Verse 44
		-
			-
				thanes' huge treasure, than those had done
			-
		-
			Verse 45
		-
			-
				who in former time forth had sent him
			-
		-
			Verse 46
		-
			-
				sole on the seas, a suckling child.
			-
		-
			Verse 47
		-
			-
				High o'er his head they hoist the standard,
			-
		-
			Verse 48
		-
			-
				a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,
			-
		-
			Verse 49
		-
			-
				gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,
			-
		-
			Verse 50
		-
			-
				mournful their mood. No man is able
			-
		-
			Verse 51
		-
			-
				to say in sooth, no son of the halls,
			-
		-
			Verse 52
		-
			-
				no hero 'neath heaven, - who harbored that freight!
			-
		-
			Verse 53
		-
			-
				Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,
			-
		-
			Verse 54
		-
			-
				leader beloved, and long he ruled
			-
		-
			Verse 55
		-
			-
				in fame with all folk, since his father had gone
			-
		-
			Verse 56
		-
			-
				away from the world, till awoke an heir,
			-
		-
			Verse 57
		-
			-
				haughty Healfdene, who held through life,
			-
		-
			Verse 58
		-
			-
				sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.
			-
		-
			Verse 59
		-
			-
				Then, one after one, there woke to him,
			-
		-
			Verse 60
		-
			-
				to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:
			-
		-
			Verse 61
		-
			-
				Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;
			-
		-
			Verse 62
		-
			-
				and I heard that - was -'s queen,
			-
		-
			Verse 63
		-
			-
				the Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear.
			-
		-
			Verse 64
		-
			-
				To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,
			-
		-
			Verse 65
		-
			-
				such honor of combat, that all his kin
			-
		-
			Verse 66
		-
			-
				obeyed him gladly till great grew his band
			-
		-
			Verse 67
		-
			-
				of youthful comrades. It came in his mind
			-
		-
			Verse 68
		-
			-
				to bid his henchmen a hall uprear,
			-
		-
			Verse 69
		-
			-
				a master mead-house, mightier far
			-
		-
			Verse 70
		-
			-
				than ever was seen by the sons of earth,
			-
		-
			Verse 71
		-
			-
				and within it, then, to old and young
			-
		-
			Verse 72
		-
			-
				he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,
			-
		-
			Verse 73
		-
			-
				save only the land and the lives of his men.
			-
		-
			Verse 74
		-
			-
				Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,
			-
		-
			Verse 75
		-
			-
				for many a tribe this mid-earth round,
			-
		-
			Verse 76
		-
			-
				to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,
			-
		-
			Verse 77
		-
			-
				in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,
			-
		-
			Verse 78
		-
			-
				of halls the noblest: Heorot he named it
			-
		-
			Verse 79
		-
			-
				whose message had might in many a land.
			-
		-
			Verse 80
		-
			-
				Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,
			-
		-
			Verse 81
		-
			-
				treasure at banquet: there towered the hall,
			-
		-
			Verse 82
		-
			-
				high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting
			-
		-
			Verse 83
		-
			-
				of furious flame. Nor far was that day
			-
		-
			Verse 84
		-
			-
				when father and son-in-law stood in feud
			-
		-
			Verse 85
		-
			-
				for warfare and hatred that woke again.
			-
		-
			Verse 86
		-
			-
				With envy and anger an evil spirit
			-
		-
			Verse 87
		-
			-
				endured the dole in his dark abode,
			-
		-
			Verse 88
		-
			-
				that he heard each day the din of revel
			-
		-
			Verse 89
		-
			-
				high in the hall: there harps rang out,
			-
		-
			Verse 90
		-
			-
				clear song of the singer. He sang who knew
			-
		-
			Verse 91
		-
			-
				tales of the early time of man,
			-
		-
			Verse 92
		-
			-
				how the Almighty made the earth,
			-
		-
			Verse 93
		-
			-
				fairest fields enfolded by water,
			-
		-
			Verse 94
		-
			-
				set, triumphant, sun and moon
			-
		-
			Verse 95
		-
			-
				for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,
			-
		-
			Verse 96
		-
			-
				and braided bright the breast of earth
			-
		-
			Verse 97
		-
			-
				with limbs and leaves, made life for all
			-
		-
			Verse 98
		-
			-
				of mortal beings that breathe and move.
			-
		-
			Verse 99
		-
			-
				So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel
			-
		-
			Verse 100
		-
			-
				a winsome life, till one began
			-
		-
			Verse 101
		-
			-
				to fashion evils, that field of hell.
			-
		-
			Verse 102
		-
			-
				Grendel this monster grim was called,
			-
		-
			Verse 103
		-
			-
				march-riever mighty, in moorland living,
			-
		-
			Verse 104
		-
			-
				in fen and fastness; fief of the giants
			-
		-
			Verse 105
		-
			-
				the hapless wight a while had kept
			-
		-
			Verse 106
		-
			-
				since the Creator his exile doomed.
			-
		-
			Verse 107
		-
			-
				On kin of Cain was the killing avenged
			-
		-
			Verse 108
		-
			-
				by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.
			-
		-
			Verse 109
		-
			-
				Ill fared his feud, and far was he driven,
			-
		-
			Verse 110
		-
			-
				for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men.
			-
		-
			Verse 111
		-
			-
				Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,
			-
		-
			Verse 112
		-
			-
				Etins and elves and evil-spirits,
			-
		-
			Verse 113
		-
			-
				as well as the giants that warred with God
			-
		-
			Verse 114
		-
			-
				weary while: but their wage was paid them!
			-
		-
			Verse 115
		-
			-
				WENT he forth to find at fall of night
			-
		-
			Verse 116
		-
			-
				that haughty house, and heed wherever
			-
		-
			Verse 117
		-
			-
				the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.
			-
		-
			Verse 118
		-
			-
				Found within it the atheling band
			-
		-
			Verse 119
		-
			-
				asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,
			-
		-
			Verse 120
		-
			-
				of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,
			-
		-
			Verse 121
		-
			-
				grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,
			-
		-
			Verse 122
		-
			-
				wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,
			-
		-
			Verse 123
		-
			-
				thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed
			-
		-
			Verse 124
		-
			-
				fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,
			-
		-
			Verse 125
		-
			-
				laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.
			-
		-
			Verse 126
		-
			-
				Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,
			-
		-
			Verse 127
		-
			-
				the might of Grendel to men was known;
			-
		-
			Verse 128
		-
			-
				then after wassail was wail uplifted,
			-
		-
			Verse 129
		-
			-
				loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,
			-
		-
			Verse 130
		-
			-
				atheling excellent, unblithe sat,
			-
		-
			Verse 131
		-
			-
				labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,
			-
		-
			Verse 132
		-
			-
				when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,
			-
		-
			Verse 133
		-
			-
				spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,
			-
		-
			Verse 134
		-
			-
				too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;
			-
		-
			Verse 135
		-
			-
				with night returning, anew began
			-
		-
			Verse 136
		-
			-
				ruthless murder; he recked no whit,
			-
		-
			Verse 137
		-
			-
				firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.
			-
		-
			Verse 138
		-
			-
				They were easy to find who elsewhere sought
			-
		-
			Verse 139
		-
			-
				in room remote their rest at night,
			-
		-
			Verse 140
		-
			-
				bed in the bowers, when that bale was shown,
			-
		-
			Verse 141
		-
			-
				was seen in sooth, with surest token, -
			-
		-
			Verse 142
		-
			-
				the hall-thane's hate. Such held themselves
			-
		-
			Verse 143
		-
			-
				far and fast who the fiend outran!
			-
		-
			Verse 144
		-
			-
				Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill
			-
		-
			Verse 145
		-
			-
				one against all; until empty stood
			-
		-
			Verse 146
		-
			-
				that lordly building, and long it bode so.
			-
		-
			Verse 147
		-
			-
				Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore,
			-
		-
			Verse 148
		-
			-
				sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,
			-
		-
			Verse 149
		-
			-
				boundless cares. There came unhidden
			-
		-
			Verse 150
		-
			-
				tidings true to the tribes of men,
			-
		-
			Verse 151
		-
			-
				in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel
			-
		-
			Verse 152
		-
			-
				harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,
			-
		-
			Verse 153
		-
			-
				what murder and massacre, many a year,
			-
		-
			Verse 154
		-
			-
				feud unfading, - refused consent
			-
		-
			Verse 155
		-
			-
				to deal with any of Daneland's earls,
			-
		-
			Verse 156
		-
			-
				make pact of peace, or compound for gold:
			-
		-
			Verse 157
		-
			-
				still less did the wise men ween to get
			-
		-
			Verse 158
		-
			-
				great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.
			-
		-
			Verse 159
		-
			-
				But the evil one ambushed old and young
			-
		-
			Verse 160
		-
			-
				death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,
			-
		-
			Verse 161
		-
			-
				lured, or lurked in the livelong night
			-
		-
			Verse 162
		-
			-
				of misty moorlands: men may say not
			-
		-
			Verse 163
		-
			-
				where the haunts of these Hell-Runes be.
			-
		-
			Verse 164
		-
			-
				Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,
			-
		-
			Verse 165
		-
			-
				lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,
			-
		-
			Verse 166
		-
			-
				harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded,
			-
		-
			Verse 167
		-
			-
				gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;
			-
		-
			Verse 168
		-
			-
				and ne'er could the prince approach his throne,
			-
		-
			Verse 169
		-
			-
				- 'twas judgment of God, - or have joy in his hall.
			-
		-
			Verse 170
		-
			-
				Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend,
			-
		-
			Verse 171
		-
			-
				heart-rending misery. Many nobles
			-
		-
			Verse 172
		-
			-
				sat assembled, and searched out counsel
			-
		-
			Verse 173
		-
			-
				how it were best for bold-hearted men
			-
		-
			Verse 174
		-
			-
				against harassing terror to try their hand.
			-
		-
			Verse 175
		-
			-
				Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes
			-
		-
			Verse 176
		-
			-
				altar-offerings, asked with words
			-
		-
			Verse 177
		-
			-
				that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them
			-
		-
			Verse 178
		-
			-
				for the pain of their people. Their practice this,
			-
		-
			Verse 179
		-
			-
				their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of
			-
		-
			Verse 180
		-
			-
				in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,
			-
		-
			Verse 181
		-
			-
				Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,
			-
		-
			Verse 182
		-
			-
				nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,
			-
		-
			Verse 183
		-
			-
				Wielder-of-Wonder. - Woe for that man
			-
		-
			Verse 184
		-
			-
				who in harm and hatred hales his soul
			-
		-
			Verse 185
		-
			-
				to fiery embraces; - nor favor nor change
			-
		-
			Verse 186
		-
			-
				awaits he ever. But well for him
			-
		-
			Verse 187
		-
			-
				that after death-day may draw to his Lord,
			-
		-
			Verse 188
		-
			-
				and friendship find in the Father's arms!
			-
		-
			Verse 189
		-
			-
				THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene
			-
		-
			Verse 190
		-
			-
				with the woe of these days; not wisest men
			-
		-
			Verse 191
		-
			-
				assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,
			-
		-
			Verse 192
		-
			-
				loathly and long, that lay on his folk,
			-
		-
			Verse 193
		-
			-
				most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.
			-
		-
			Verse 194
		-
			-
				This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,
			-
		-
			Verse 195
		-
			-
				great among Geats, of Grendel's doings.
			-
		-
			Verse 196
		-
			-
				He was the mightiest man of valor
			-
		-
			Verse 197
		-
			-
				in that same day of this our life,
			-
		-
			Verse 198
		-
			-
				stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker
			-
		-
			Verse 199
		-
			-
				he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,
			-
		-
			Verse 200
		-
			-
				far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,
			-
		-
			Verse 201
		-
			-
				the noble monarch who needed men!
			-
		-
			Verse 202
		-
			-
				The prince's journey by prudent folk
			-
		-
			Verse 203
		-
			-
				was little blamed, though they loved him dear;
			-
		-
			Verse 204
		-
			-
				they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.
			-
		-
			Verse 205
		-
			-
				And now the bold one from bands of Geats
			-
		-
			Verse 206
		-
			-
				comrades chose, the keenest of warriors
			-
		-
			Verse 207
		-
			-
				e'er he could find; with fourteen men
			-
		-
			Verse 208
		-
			-
				the sea-wood he sought, and, sailor proved,
			-
		-
			Verse 209
		-
			-
				led them on to the land's confines.
			-
		-
			Verse 210
		-
			-
				Time had now flown; afloat was the ship,
			-
		-
			Verse 211
		-
			-
				boat under bluff. On board they climbed,
			-
		-
			Verse 212
		-
			-
				warriors ready; waves were churning
			-
		-
			Verse 213
		-
			-
				sea with sand; the sailors bore
			-
		-
			Verse 214
		-
			-
				on the breast of the bark their bright array,
			-
		-
			Verse 215
		-
			-
				their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,
			-
		-
			Verse 216
		-
			-
				on its willing way, the well-braced craft.
			-
		-
			Verse 217
		-
			-
				Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind
			-
		-
			Verse 218
		-
			-
				that bark like a bird with breast of foam,
			-
		-
			Verse 219
		-
			-
				till in season due, on the second day,
			-
		-
			Verse 220
		-
			-
				the curved prow such course had run
			-
		-
			Verse 221
		-
			-
				that sailors now could see the land,
			-
		-
			Verse 222
		-
			-
				sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,
			-
		-
			Verse 223
		-
			-
				headlands broad. Their haven was found,
			-
		-

			Verse 711
		-

			-
		-
			Verse 712
		-
			-
				The monster was minded of mankind now

		-
			Verse 713
		-
			-
				sundry to seize in the stately house.
			-
		-
			Verse 714
		-
			-
				Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,

		-
			Verse 715
		-
			-
				gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,
			-
		-
			Verse 716
		-

			-
		-
			Verse 719
		-
			-
				such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!
			-
		-
			Verse 720
		-
			-
				To the house the warrior walked apace,
			-
		-
			Verse 721
		-
			-
				parted from peace; the portal opended,
			-
		-
			Verse 722
		-
			-
				though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it,
			-
		-
			Verse 723
		-
			-
				and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,

		-
			Verse 724
		-
			-
				the house's mouth. All hastily, then,
			-
		-
			Verse 725
		-
			-
				o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,
			-
		-
			Verse 726
		-
			-
				ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes
			-
		-
			Verse 727
		-
			-
				fearful flashes, like flame to see.
			-
		-
			Verse 728
		-
			-
				He spied in hall the hero-band,
			-
		-
			Verse 729
		-
			-
				kin and clansmen clustered asleep,
			-
		-
			Verse 730
		-
			-
				hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;
			-
		-
			Verse 731
		-
			-
				for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,
			-
		-
			Verse 732
		-
			-
				savage, to sever the soul of each,
			-
		-
			Verse 733
		-
			-
				life from body, since lusty banquet
			-
		-
			Verse 734
		-
			-
				waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him
			-
		-
			Verse 735
		-
			-
				to seize any more of men on earth
			-
		-
			Verse 736
		-
			-
				after that evening. Eagerly watched
			-
		-
			Verse 737
		-
			-
				Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,
			-
		-
			Verse 738
		-
			-
				how he would fare in fell attack.
			-
		-
			Verse 739
		-
			-
				Not that the monster was minded to pause!
			-
		-
			Verse 740
		-
			-
				Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior
			-
		-
			Verse 741
		-
			-
				for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,
			-
		-
			Verse 742
		-
			-
				the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,
			-
		-
			Verse 743
		-
			-
				swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus
			-
		-
			Verse 744
		-
			-
				the lifeless corse was clear devoured,
			-
		-
			Verse 745
		-
			-
				e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;
			-
		-
			Verse 746
		-
			-
				for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,
			-
		-
			Verse 747
		-
			-
				felt for the foe with fiendish claw,
			-
		-
			Verse 748
		-
			-
				for the hero reclining, - who clutched it boldly,
			-
		-
			Verse 749
		-
			-
				prompt to answer, propped on his arm.
			-
		-
			Verse 750
		-
			-
				Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils
			-
		-
			Verse 751
		-
			-
				that never he met in this middle-world,
			-
		-
			Verse 752
		-
			-
				in the ways of earth, another wight
			-
		-
			Verse 753
		-
			-
				with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,
			-
		-
			Verse 754
		-
			-
				sorrowed in soul, - none the sooner escaped!
			-
		-
			Verse 755
		-
			-
				Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,
			-
		-
			Verse 756
		-
			-
				the den of devils: no doings now
			-
		-
			Verse 757
		-
			-
				such as oft he had done in days of old!
			-
		-
			Verse 758
		-
			-
				Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane
			-
		-
			Verse 759
		-
			-
				of his boast at evening: up he bounded,
			-
		-
			Verse 760
		-
			-
				grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.
			-
		-
			Verse 761
		-
			-
				The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.
			-
		-
			Verse 762
		-
			-
				The monster meant - if he might at all -
			-
		-
			Verse 763
		-
			-
				to fling himself free, and far away
			-
		-
			Verse 764
		-
			-
				fly to the fens, - knew his fingers' power
			-
		-
			Verse 765
		-
			-
				in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march
			-
		-
			Verse 766
		-
			-
				to Heorot this monster of harm had made!
			-
		-
			Verse 767
		-
			-
				Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,
			-
		-
			Verse 768
		-
			-
				castle-dwellers and clansmen all,
			-
		-
			Verse 769
		-
			-
				earls, of their ale. Angry were both
			-
		-
			Verse 770
		-
			-
				those savage hall-guards: the house resounded.
			-
		-
			Verse 771
		-
			-
				Wonder it was the wine-hall firm
			-
		-
			Verse 772
		-
			-
				in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth
			-
		-
			Verse 773
		-
			-
				the fair house fell not; too fast it was
			-
		-
			Verse 774
		-
			-
				within and without by its iron bands
			-
		-
			Verse 775
		-
			-
				craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill
			-
		-
			Verse 776
		-
			-
				many a mead-bench - men have told me -
			-
		-
			Verse 777
		-
			-
				gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.
			-
		-
			Verse 778
		-
			-
				So well had weened the wisest Scyldings
			-
		-
			Verse 779
		-
			-
				that not ever at all might any man
			-

			Verse 780
		-

		-
			Verse 781
		-
			-
				crush by craft, - unless clasp of fire
			-
		-
			Verse 782
		-
			-
				in smoke engulfed it. - Again uprose
			-
		-
			Verse 783
		-
			-
				din redoubled. Danes of the North
			-
		-
			Verse 784
		-
			-
				with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,
			-
		-
			Verse 785
		-
			-
				who from the wall that wailing heard,
			-
		-
			Verse 786
		-
			-
				God's foe sounding his grisly song,
			-
		-
			Verse 787
		-
			-
				cry of the conquered, clamorous pain
			-
		-
			Verse 788
		-
			-
				from captive of hell. Too closely held him
			-
		-
			Verse 789
		-
			-
				he who of men in might was strongest
			-
		-
			Verse 790
		-
			-
				in that same day of this our life.
			-
		-
			Verse 791
		-
			-
				NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence
			-
		-
			Verse 792
		-
			-
				suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,
			-
		-
			Verse 793
		-
			-
				useless deeming his days and years
			-
		-
			Verse 794
		-
			-
				to men on earth. Now many an earl
			-
		-
			Verse 795
		-
			-
				of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,
			-
		-
			Verse 796
		-
			-
				fain the life of their lord to shield,

		-
			Verse 797
		-
			-
				their praised prince, if power were theirs;

			Verse 798
		-

				never they knew, - as they neared the foe,
			-
		-
			Verse 799
		-
			-
				hardy-hearted heroes of war,
			-
		-
			Verse 800
		-
			-
				aiming their swords on every side
			-
		-
			Verse 801
		-
			-
				the accursed to kill, - no keenest blade,

		-
			Verse 802
		-
			-
				no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,
			-
		-
			Verse 803
		-
			-
				could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!
			-
		-
			Verse 804
		-
			-
				He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,
			-
		-
			Verse 805
		-
			-
				from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting

		-
			Verse 806
		-
			-
				on that same day of this our life
			-
		-
			Verse 807
		-
			-
				woful should be, and his wandering soul

			Verse 809
		-
			-
				Soon he found, who in former days,

		-
			Verse 810
		-
			-
				harmful in heart and hated of God,
			-
		-
			Verse 811
		-
			-
				on many a man such murder wrought,
			-
		-
			Verse 812
		-
			-
				that the frame of his body failed him now.
			-
		-
			Verse 813
		-
			-
				For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac
			-
		-
			Verse 814
		-
			-
				held in hand; hateful alive
			-
		-
			Verse 815
		-
			-
				was each to other. The outlaw dire
			-
		-
			Verse 816
		-
			-
				took mortal hurt; a mighty wound
			-
		-
			Verse 817
		-
			-
				showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,
			-
		-
			Verse 818
		-
			-
				and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now
			-
		-
			Verse 819
		-
			-
				the glory was given, and Grendel thence
			-
		-
			Verse 820
		-
			-
				death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,
			-
		-
			Verse 821
		-
			-
				noisome abode: he knew too well

		-
			Verse 822
		-
			-
				that here was the last of life, an end
			-
		-
			Verse 823
		-
			-
				of his days on earth. - To all the Danes

			Verse 824
		-

				by that bloody battle the boon had come.

			Verse 826
		-
			-
				Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one

		-
			Verse 827
		-
			-
				had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,

		-
			Verse 828
		-
			-
				his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes
			-
		-
			Verse 829
		-
			-
				had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,
			-
		-
			Verse 830
		-
			-
				all their sorrow and ills assuaged,
			-
		-
			Verse 831
		-

				their bale of battle borne so long,
			-
		-
			Verse 832
		-
			-
				and all the dole they erst endured

			Verse 833
		-
			-
				pain a-plenty. - 'Twas proof of this,

		-
			Verse 834
		-

				of Grendel's gripe, - 'neath the gabled roof'
			-

			Verse 837
		-

				MANY at morning, as men have told me,

			Verse 840
		-
			-
				o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,

		-
			-
				trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed

		-
			Verse 842
		-
			-
				the enemy's end to any man
			-
		-
			Verse 843
		-
			-
				who saw by the gait of the graceless foe
			-
		-
			Verse 844
		-
			-
				how the weary-hearted, away from thence,
			-
		-
			Verse 845
		-
			-
				baffled in battle and banned, his steps
			-
		-
			Verse 846
		-
			-
				death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.
			-
		-
			Verse 847
		-
			-
				Bloody the billows were boiling there,
			-
		-
			Verse 848
		-
			-
				turbid the tide of tumbling waves
			-
		-
			Verse 849
		-
			-
				horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,
			-
		-
			Verse 850
		-
			-
				by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor
			-
		-
			Verse 851
		-
			-
				laid forlorn his life adown,
			-
		-
			Verse 852
		-
			-
				his heathen soul,-and hell received it.
			-
		-
			Verse 853
		-
			-
				Home then rode the hoary clansmen
			-
		-
			Verse 854
		-
			-
				from that merry journey, and many a youth,

		-
			Verse 855
		-
			-
				on horses white, the hardy warriors,
			-
		-
			Verse 856
		-
			-
				back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory
			-
		-
			Verse 857
		-
			-
				eager they echoed, and all averred

		-
			Verse 858
		-
			-
				that from sea to sea, or south or north,

			Verse 859
		-

				(On their lord beloved they laid no slight,

			Verse 865
		-
			-
				their gray steeds set to gallop amain,

		-
			Verse 866
		-
			-
				and ran a race when the road seemed fair.

		-
			Verse 867
		-
			-
				From time to time, a thane of the king,

			Verse 868

				who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,

				bound word to word in well-knit rime,

			Verse 872
		-

				of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,

			Verse 875
		-

				Strange the story: he said it all, -

			Verse 877
		-

				the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,

			Verse 878

				Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-

		-
			Verse 958
		-
			-
				"This work of war most willingly

		-
			Verse 959
		-

			Verse 993
		-

				of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,

			Verse 1009
		-

				Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng

			Verse 1013
		-

				Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,

		-
			Verse 1014
		-
			-
				fain of the feasting. Featly received
			-
		-
			Verse 1015
		-
			-
				many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,

		-
			Verse 1016
		-
			-
				kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,

		-
			Verse 1017
		-
			-
				Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now
			-
		-
			Verse 1018
		-
			-
				was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings
			-
		-
			Verse 1019
		-
			-
				ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed.
			-
		-
			Verse 1020
		-
			-
				To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene
			-
		-
			Verse 1021
		-
			-
				a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,
			-
		-
			Verse 1022
		-
			-
				broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;
			-
		-
			Verse 1023
		-
			-
				and a splendid sword was seen of many
			-
		-
			Verse 1024
		-
			-
				borne to the brave one. Beowulf took
			-
		-
			Verse 1025
		-
			-
				cup in hall: for such costly gifts

		-
			Verse 1026
		-
			-
				he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.
			-
		-
			Verse 1027
		-
			-
				For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,
			-
		-
			Verse 1028
		-
			-
				with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,
			-
		-
			Verse 1029
		-
			-
				on the ale-bench honoring others thus!
			-
		-
			Verse 1030
		-
			-
				O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,
			-
		-
			Verse 1031
		-
			-
				wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head,
			-
		-
			Verse 1032
		-
			-
				lest the relict-of-files should fierce invade,
			-
		-
			Verse 1033
		-
			-
				sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero

		-
			Verse 1034
		-
			-
				should go to grapple against his foes.
			-
		-
			Verse 1035
		-
			-
				Then the earls'-defence on the floor bade lead

		-
			Verse 1036
		-
			-
				coursers eight, with carven head-gear,
			-
		-
			Verse 1037
		-
			-
				adown the hall: one horse was decked

		-
			Verse 1038
		-
			-
				with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;

		-
			Verse 1039
		-

			Verse 1040
		-
			-
				when to play of swords the son of Healfdene
			-
		-
			Verse 1041
		-
			-
				was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor
			-
		-
			Verse 1042
		-
			-
				in the crush of combat when corpses fell.
			-
		-
			Verse 1043
		-
			-
				To Beowulf over them both then gave
			-
		-
			Verse 1044
		-
			-
				the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,
			-
		-
			Verse 1045
		-
			-
				o'er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.
			-
		-
			Verse 1046
		-
			-
				Manfully thus the mighty prince,
			-
		-
			Verse 1047
		-
			-
				hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid
			-
		-
			Verse 1048
		-
			-
				with steeds and treasures contemned by none
			-
		-
			Verse 1049
		-
			-
				who is willing to say the sooth aright.
			-
		-
			Verse 1050
		-
			-
				AND the lord of earls, to each that came
			-
		-
			Verse 1051
		-
			-
				with Beowulf over the briny ways,
			-
		-
			Verse 1052
		-
			-
				an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,
			-
		-
			Verse 1053
		-
			-
				precious gift; and the price bade pay
			-
		-
			Verse 1054
		-
			-
				in gold for him whom Grendel erst
			-
		-
			Verse 1055
		-
			-
				murdered, - and fain of them more had killed,
			-
		-
			Verse 1056
		-
			-
				had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,

		-
			Verse 1057
		-
			-
				and the man's brave mood. The Maker then
			-
		-
			Verse 1058
		-
			-
				ruled human kind, as here and now.
			-
		-
			Verse 1059
		-
			-
				Therefore is insight always best,
			-
		-
			Verse 1060
		-
			-
				and forethought of mind. How much awaits him
			-
		-
			Verse 1061
		-
			-
				of lief and of loath, who long time here,
			-
		-
			Verse 1062
		-
			-
				through days of warfare this world endures!
			-
		-
			Verse 1063
		-

				Then song and music mingled sounds

			Verse 1064
		-
			-
				in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies
			-
		-
			Verse 1065
		-
			-
				and harping was heard with the hero-lay
			-
		-
			Verse 1066
		-
			-
				as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke
			-
		-
			Verse 1067
		-
			-
				along the mead-seats, making his song

			Verse 1069
		-
			-
				Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,

			-
				was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.
			-
		-
			Verse 1071
		-
			-
				Hildeburh needed not hold in value

				her enemies' honor! Innocent both

			Verse 1074
		-

			Verse 1084
		-
			-
				and rescue his remnant by right of arms
			-

			Verse 1085
		-

				"Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed

				"Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better

			Verse 1399
		-

				For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled

			Verse 1400

		-
			Verse 1401
		-
			-
				stately rode on; his shield-armed men

		-
			-
				followed in force. The footprints led

			Verse 1403
		-

			Verse 1414
		-

			Verse 1415
		-
			-
				hanging over the hoary rock,
			-
		-
			Verse 1416
		-
			-
				a woful wood: the waves below

		-
			Verse 1417
		-
			-
				were dyed in blood. The Danish men

			Verse 1418
		-
			-

			Verse 1423
		-

			Verse 1424
		-

			Verse 1425
		-

		-
			Verse 1426
		-
			-
				sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,

		-
			-
				on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, -

		-
			Verse 1430
		-
			-
				and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,

		-
			Verse 1431
		-
			-
				swollen and savage that song to hear,

		-
			Verse 1432
		-
			-
				that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,
			-
		-
			Verse 1433
		-

			Verse 1434
		-

			Verse 1437
		-
			-
				Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well

			Verse 1438
		-
			-
				hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,

		-
			Verse 1439
		-
			-
				done to death and dragged on the headland,

		-
			Verse 1440
		-

			Verse 1443
		-
			-
				His breastplate broad and bright of hues,

			Verse 1444
		-

				woven by hand, should the waters try;

			Verse 1445
		-

		-
			Verse 1448
		-

				And the helmet white that his head protected

				was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,

			Verse 1455
		-

				Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps

		-
			Verse 1465
		-
			-
				For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf

		-
			Verse 1466
		-
			-
				sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,

		-
			Verse 1467
		-
			-
				drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent

				to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not

		-
			Verse 1469
		-

				under welter of waters wager his life

			Verse 1470
		-

			Verse 1475
		-
			-
				gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,

		-
			-
				sovran wise, what once was said:

				Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow

			Verse 2178

				as a man remarked for mighty deeds

			Verse 2212
		-
			-
				In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,

			Verse 2213
		-
			-
				in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,

		-
			Verse 2214
		-
			-
				unknown to mortals. Some man, however,

		-
			Verse 2215
		-
			-
				came by chance that cave within
			-
		-
			Verse 2216
		-
			-
				to the heathen hoard. In hand he took
			-
		-
			Verse 2217
		-
			-
				a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,
			-
		-
			Verse 2218
		-
			-

			Verse 2219
		-
			-
				by thievish wiles: for the warden's wrath

		-
			Verse 2220
		-
			-
				prince and people must pay betimes!
			-
		-
			Verse 2221
		-

				THAT way he went with no will of his own,

		-
			Verse 2222
		-
			-
				in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,

		-
			Verse 2223
		-
			-
				but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane.
			-
		-
			Verse 2224
		-
			-
				He fled in fear the fatal scourge,
			-
		-
			Verse 2225
		-
			-
				seeking shelter, a sinful man,
			-
		-
			Verse 2226
		-
			-
				and entered in. At the awful sight
			-
		-
			Verse 2227
		-
			-
				tottered that guest, and terror seized him;

		-
			Verse 2228
		-
			-

			-
		-
			Verse 2229
		-
			-
				from fright and fear ere he fled away,
			-
		-
			Verse 2230
		-
			-
				and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.

			Verse 2231
		-
			-
				Of such besides there was store enough,

			Verse 2232
		-

				heirlooms old, the earth below,
			-
		-
			Verse 2233
		-
			-
				which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,

			Verse 2234
		-

				left the last of his lofty race,

		-
			Verse 2235
		-

			Verse 2236
		-
			-
				dearest treasure. For death of yore
			-
		-
			Verse 2237
		-
			-
				had hurried all hence; and he alone
			-
		-
			Verse 2238
		-
			-
				left to live, the last of the clan,

		-
			Verse 2239
		-
			-
				weeping his friends, yet wished to bide
			-
		-
			Verse 2240
		-
			-
				warding the treasure, his one delight,

				though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,

			Verse 2242
		-
			-
				to strand and sea-waves stood anear,
			-
		-
			Verse 2243
		-

		-
			Verse 2244
		-
			-
				there laid within it his lordly heirlooms

		-
			Verse 2245
		-
			-
				and heaped hoard of heavy gold
			-
		-
			Verse 2246
		-
			-
				that warden of rings. Few words he spake:

		-
			Verse 2247
		-
			-
				"Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,

		-
			Verse 2248
		-

			Verse 2250
		-
			-
				and cruel killing my clansmen all,

			Verse 2251
		-

		-
			-
				Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,

		-
			Verse 2268
		-
			-
				alone, for them all, and unblithe wept

			Verse 2269
		-

			Verse 2273

			Verse 2279
		-
			-
				held the house of the hoard in earth

		-
			Verse 2281
		-
			-
				wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing

		-
			Verse 2282
		-
			-
				that costly cup, and the king implored
			-
		-
			Verse 2283
		-
			-
				for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,

			Verse 2284

			-
				borne off was booty. His boon was granted

			Verse 2285
		-

		-
			-
				first time what was fashioned in far-off days.
			-
		-
			Verse 2287
		-

				When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.

				O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found

		-

				the grace of The Wielder! - That warden of gold

		-
			Verse 2294
		-

				o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find

		-
			Verse 2295
		-
			-
				the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.
			-
		-
			Verse 2296
		-

			Verse 2297
		-

				all without; nor was any there,

		-
			Verse 2298
		-
			-
				none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,

		-
			Verse 2299
		-
			-
				was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,
			-
		-
			Verse 2300
		-
			-
				sought the cup, and discovered soon
			-
		-
			Verse 2301
		-
			-
				that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,

		-
			Verse 2302
		-
			-
				his lordly gold. The guardian waited

		-
			Verse 2303
		-
			-
				ill-enduring till evening came;
			-
		-
			Verse 2304
		-
			-
				boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,

			Verse 2305
		-
			-
				and fain with flame the foe to pay

		-
			Verse 2306
		-
			-
				for the dear cup's loss. - Now day was fled
			-
		-
			Verse 2307
		-
			-
				as the worm had wished. By its wall no more
			-
		-
			Verse 2308
		-
			-
				was it glad to bide, but burning flew
			-
		-
			Verse 2309
		-
			-
				folded in flame: a fearful beginning
			-
		-
			Verse 2310
		-
			-
				for sons of the soil; and soon it came,
			-
		-
			Verse 2311
		-
			-
				in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.
			-
		-
			Verse 2312
		-
			-
				THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,
			-
		-
			Verse 2313
		-
			-
				and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high
			-
		-
			Verse 2314
		-
			-
				all landsfolk frighting. No living thing

		-
			Verse 2315
		-
			-
				would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.
			-
		-
			Verse 2316
		-
			-
				Wide was the dragon's warring seen,
			-
		-
			Verse 2317
		-
			-
				its fiendish fury far and near,
			-
		-
			Verse 2318
		-
			-
				as the grim destroyer those Geatish people
			-
		-
			Verse 2319
		-
			-
				hated and hounded. To hidden lair,
			-
		-
			Verse 2320
		-
			-
				to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.
			-
		-
			Verse 2321
		-
			-
				Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,
			-
		-
			Verse 2322
		-
			-
				with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,

		-
			Verse 2323
		-
			-
				its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain!
			-
		-
			Verse 2324
		-
			-
				To Beowulf then the bale was told
			-
		-
			Verse 2325
		-
			-
				quickly and truly: the king's own home,
			-
		-
			Verse 2326
		-
			-
				of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,

		-
			Verse 2327

			Verse 2328
		-
			-
				sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow.

		-
			Verse 2329
		-
			-
				The sage assumed that his sovran God
			-
		-
			Verse 2330
		-
			-
				he had angered, breaking ancient law,
			-
		-
			Verse 2331
		-
			-
				and embittered the Lord. His breast within
			-
		-
			Verse 2332
		-
			-
				with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.
			-
		-
			Verse 2333
		-
			-
				The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon
			-
		-
			Verse 2334
		-
			-
				with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all
			-
		-
			Verse 2335
		-
			-
				washed by waves; but the warlike king,
			-
		-
			Verse 2336
		-
			-
				prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.

		-
			Verse 2337
		-
			-
				Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work

		-
			Verse 2338
		-
			-
				all of iron - the earl's commander -
			-

			Verse 2341
		-
			-

			Verse 2342
		-
			-
				he was fated to finish this fleeting life,

			Verse 2343
		-
			-
				his days on earth, and the dragon with him,

		-
			Verse 2344
		-
			-
				though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard! -
			-
		-
			Verse 2345
		-
			-
				Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,
			-
		-
			Verse 2346
		-
			-
				to follow the flyer-afar with a host,
			-
		-
			Verse 2347
		-
			-
				a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,
			-
		-
			Verse 2348
		-
			-
				nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,
			-
		-
			Verse 2349
		-
			-
				its vigor and valor: ventures desperate
			-
		-
			Verse 2350
		-
			-
				he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,

			Verse 2351
		-
			-
				contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,
			-
		-
			Verse 2352
		-
			-
				Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,

			Verse 2353
		-
			-
				and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,
			-
		-
			Verse 2354
		-
			-
				loathsome breed! Not least was that
			-
		-
			Verse 2355
		-
			-
				of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,
			-
		-
			Verse 2356
		-
			-
				when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,

			Verse 2357
		-
			-
				lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,

			Verse 2358
		-

			Verse 2360
		-
			-
				through strength of himself and his swimming power,

			Verse 2361
		-
			-

		-
			Verse 2362
		-
			-

				in after days; and to Eadgils he proved

			Verse 2394
		-

			Verse 2396
		-

				those care-paths cold when the king he slew.
			-
		-
			Verse 2397
		-

		-
			Verse 2403
		-
			-
				He had heard whence all the harm arose

			Verse 2404
		-
			-
				and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price

			Verse 2405
		-

				on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.

				starter of all the strife and ill,
			-
		-
			Verse 2408
		-

		-
			Verse 2411
		-
			-
				the barrow delved near billowy surges,
			-
		-
			Verse 2412
		-

			Verse 2413
		-
			-
				of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,

		-
			Verse 2414
		-
			-
				warrior trusty, the treasures held,

			Verse 2418
		-
			-
				spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,
			-
		-
			Verse 2419
		-
			-
				gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,
			-

				Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:-

			Verse 2426
		-
			-
				"Through store of struggles I strove in youth,
			-
		-
			Verse 2427
		-
			-
				mighty feuds; I mind them all.

			Verse 2428
		-
			-
				I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,

		-
			Verse 2430

		-
			Verse 2481
		-
			-
				though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,

		-
			Verse 2482
		-

		-

				fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.

				Wide split the war-helm: wan he fell,

			Verse 2583
		-
			-
				those vicious fires. No victor's glory

			Verse 2584
		-

				Not long he lingered. The linden yellow,

			Verse 2699
		-
			-
				A little lower the loathsome beast

			Verse 2700

		-
			Verse 2701
		-

			Verse 2702
		-
			-
				to lose and lessen. At last the king

			Verse 2704
		-

			Verse 2709
		-

				in danger's day! - Of deeds of valor

			Verse 2710
		-

			Verse 2714
		-
			-
				in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,

			Verse 2715
		-
			-
				pain of poison. The prince walked on,

		-
			Verse 2716
		-
			-
				wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;
			-
		-
			Verse 2717
		-
			-
				then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,
			-
		-
			Verse 2718
		-
			-
				where arch of stone and steadfast column
			-

			Verse 2719
		-

			Verse 2725
		-
			-
				his mortal wound; full well he knew
			-
		-
			Verse 2726
		-
			-
				his portion now was past and gone

			Verse 2727
		-
			-
				of earthly bliss, and all had fled
			-
		-
			Verse 2728
		-
			-
				of his file of days, and death was near:
			-
		-
			Verse 2729
		-
			-
				"I would fain bestow on son of mine

			Verse 2737
		-
			-
				what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;

		-
			Verse 2756
		-
			-
				Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,
			-
		-
			Verse 2757
		-
			-
				passing the seat, saw store of jewels

		-
			Verse 2758
		-
			-
				and glistening gold the ground along;

		-
			Verse 2759
		-
			-
				by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel

		-
			Verse 2762
		-
			-
				reft of richness; rusty helms

				his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,

			Verse 2956
		-
			-
				his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,

				old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came

			Verse 2958
		-

			Verse 2960

		-
			Verse 2969
		-
			-

				and faced his foe with fell intent.

			Verse 2973
		-
			-
				too soon on his head the helm was cloven;

		-
			Verse 2974
		-
			-

		-
			-
				his folk's old herdsman, fatally hurt.

		-
			Verse 2982
		-

				earl from other, the iron-breastplate,
			-
		-
			Verse 2987
		-

			Verse 2988
		-
			-
				and the hoar-chief's harness to Hygelac carried,

			Verse 2989
		-
			-
				who took the trappings, and truly promised

		-
			Verse 2990
		-
			-
				rich fee 'mid folk, - and fulfilled it so.

				For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,

				Hrethel's offspring, when home he came,

				to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,

			-
		-
			Verse 3037
		-
			-
				in woful slaughter the Weders' king.
			-
		-
			Verse 3038
		-
			-
				There saw they, besides, the strangest being,
			-
		-
			Verse 3039
		-
			-
				loathsome, lying their leader near,
			-
		-
			Verse 3040
		-
			-
				prone on the field. The fiery dragon,
			-
		-
			Verse 3041
		-
			-
				fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.
			-
		-
			Verse 3042
		-
			-
				Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures
			-
		-
			Verse 3043
		-
			-
				in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile
			-
		-
			Verse 3044
		-
			-
				it had revelled by night, and anon come back,
			-
		-
			Verse 3045
		-
			-
				seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch
			-
		-
			Verse 3046
		-
			-
				it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.
			-
		-
			Verse 3047
		-
			-
				By it there stood the stoups and jars;
			-
		-
			Verse 3048
		-
			-
				dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords
			-
		-
			Verse 3049
		-
			-
				eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap resting,
			-
		-
			Verse 3050
		-
			-
				a thousand winters they waited there.
			-
		-
			Verse 3051
		-
			-
				For all that heritage huge, that gold
			-
		-
			Verse 3052
		-
			-
				of bygone men, was bound by a spell,
			-
		-
			Verse 3053
		-

			Verse 3054
		-

			Verse 3055

				Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, -

			Verse 3058

		-
			Verse 3059
		-
			-
				who heinously hid, that hall within,

		-
			Verse 3060
		-

				wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed

			Verse 3061
		-
			-
				one of a few, and the feud was avenged

		-
			Verse 3062
		-
			-
				in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,

		-
			Verse 3063
		-
			-
				what manner a man of might and valor
			-
		-
			Verse 3064
		-
			-
				oft ends his life, when the earl no longer

			Verse 3066
		-
			-
				So Beowulf, when that barrow's warden
			-
		-
			Verse 3067
		-
			-
				he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not
			-
		-
			Verse 3068
		-
			-
				in what wise he should wend from the world at last.
			-
		-
			Verse 3069
		-
			-
				For princes potent, who placed the gold,
			-
		-
			Verse 3070
		-
			-
				with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,
			-
		-
			Verse 3071
		-
			-
				so that marked with sin the man should be,

			Verse 3072
		-
			-
				hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,
			-
		-
			Verse 3073
		-
			-
				racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.
			-
		-
			Verse 3074
		-
			-
				Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,

		-
			Verse 3075
		-
			-
				ever the king had kept in view.
			-
		-
			Verse 3076
		-
			-
				Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:-
			-
		-
			Verse 3077
		-
			-
				"At the mandate of one, oft warriors many
			-
		-
			Verse 3078
		-
			-
				sorrow must suffer; and so must we.
			-
		-
			Verse 3079
		-
			-
				The people's-shepherd showed not aught
			-
		-
			Verse 3080
		-
			-
				of care for our counsel, king beloved!
			-
		-
			Verse 3081
		-
			-
				That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,
			-
		-
			Verse 3082
		-
			-
				but let him lie where he long had been
			-
		-
			Verse 3083
		-
			-
				in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,
			-
		-
			Verse 3084
		-
			-
				the hest of heaven. - This hoard is ours
			-
		-
			Verse 3085
		-
			-
				but grievously gotten; too grim the fate
			-
		-
			Verse 3086
		-
			-
				which thither carried our king and lord.
			-
		-
			Verse 3087
		-
			-
				I was within there, and all I viewed,
			-
		-
			Verse 3088
		-
			-
				the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me
			-
		-
			Verse 3089
		-
			-
				(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)
			-
		-
			Verse 3090
		-
			-
				under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized
			-
		-
			Verse 3091
		-
			-
				such heap from the hoard as hands could bear
			-
		-
			Verse 3092
		-
			-
				and hurriedly carried it hither back
			-
		-
			Verse 3093
		-
			-
				to my liege and lord. Alive was he still,
			-
		-
			Verse 3094
		-
			-
				still wielding his wits. The wise old man
			-
		-
			Verse 3095
		-
			-
				spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings
			-
		-
			Verse 3096
		-
			-
				and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,
			-
		-
			Verse 3097
		-
			-
				on the place of his balefire a barrow high,
			-
		-
			Verse 3098
		-
			-
				memorial mighty. Of men was he
			-
		-
			Verse 3099
		-
			-
				worthiest warrior wide earth o'er
			-
		-
			Verse 3100
		-
			-
				the while he had joy of his jewels and burg.
			-
		-
			Verse 3101
		-
			-
				Let us set out in haste now, the second time
			-
		-
			Verse 3102
		-
			-
				to see and search this store of treasure,
			-
		-
			Verse 3103
		-
			-
				these wall-hid wonders, - the way I show you, -
			-
		-
			Verse 3104
		-
			-
				where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill
			-
		-
			Verse 3105
		-
			-
				at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,
			-
		-
			Verse 3106
		-
			-
				be all in order when out we come,
			-
		-
			Verse 3107
		-
			-
				our king and captain to carry thither
			-
		-
			Verse 3108
		-
			-
				- man beloved - where long he shall bide
			-
		-
			Verse 3109
		-
			-
				safe in the shelter of sovran God."
			-
		-
			Verse 3110
		-
			-
				Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,
			-
		-
			Verse 3111
		-
			-
				hardy chief, to heroes many
			-
		-
			Verse 3112
		-
			-
				that owned their homesteads, hither to bring
			-
		-
			Verse 3113
		-
			-
				firewood from far - o'er the folk they ruled -
			-
		-
			Verse 3114
		-
			-
				for the famed-one's funeral. " Fire shall devour
			-
		-
			Verse 3115
		-
			-
				and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior
			-
		-
			Verse 3116
		-
			-
				who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,
			-
		-
			Verse 3117
		-
			-
				when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows
			-
		-
			Verse 3118
		-
			-
				shot o'er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm,
			-
		-
			Verse 3119
		-
			-
				featly feathered, followed the barb."
			-
		-
			Verse 3120
		-
			-
				And now the sage young son of Weohstan
			-
		-
			Verse 3121
		-
			-
				seven chose of the chieftain's thanes,
			-
		-
			Verse 3122
		-
			-
				the best he found that band within,
			-
		-
			Verse 3123
		-
			-
				and went with these warriors, one of eight,
			-
		-
			Verse 3124
		-
			-
				under hostile roof. In hand one bore
			-
		-
			Verse 3125
		-
			-
				a lighted torch and led the way.
			-
		-
			Verse 3126
		-
			-
				No lots they cast for keeping the hoard
			-
		-
			Verse 3127
		-
			-
				when once the warriors saw it in hall,
			-
		-
			Verse 3128
		-
			-
				altogether without a guardian,
			-
		-
			Verse 3129
		-
			-
				lying there lost. And little they mourned
			-
		-
			Verse 3130
		-
			-
				when they had hastily haled it out,
			-
		-
			Verse 3131
		-
			-
				dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,
			-
		-
			Verse 3132
		-
			-
				the worm, o'er the wall for the wave to take,
			-
		-
			Verse 3133
		-
			-
				and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.
			-
		-
			Verse 3134
		-
			-
				Then the woven gold on a wain was laden -
			-
		-
			Verse 3135
		-
			-
				countless quite! - and the king was borne,
			-
		-
			Verse 3136
		-
			-
				hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.
			-
		-
			Verse 3137
		-
			-
				THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats
			-
		-
			Verse 3138
		-
			-
				firm on the earth a funeral-pile,
			-
		-
			Verse 3139
		-
			-
				and hung it with helmets and harness of war
			-
		-
			Verse 3140
		-
			-
				and breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;
			-
		-
			Verse 3141
		-
			-
				and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain,
			-
		-
			Verse 3142
		-
			-
				heroes mourning their master dear.
			-
		-
			Verse 3143
		-
			-
				Then on the hill that hugest of balefires
			-
		-
			Verse 3144
		-
			-
				the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose
			-
		-
			Verse 3145
		-
			-
				black over blaze, and blent was the roar
			-
		-
			Verse 3146
		-
			-
				of flame with weeping (the wind was still),
			-
		-
			Verse 3147
		-
			-
				till the fire had broken the frame of bones,
			-
		-
			Verse 3148
		-
			-
				hot at the heart. In heavy mood
			-
		-
			Verse 3149
		-
			-
				their misery moaned they, their master's death.
			-
		-
			Verse 3150
		-
			-
				Wailing her woe, the widow old,
			-
		-
			Verse 3151
		-
			-
				her hair upbound, for Beowulf's death
			-
		-
			Verse 3152
		-
			-
				sung in her sorrow, and said full oft
			-
		-
			Verse 3153
		-
			-
				she dreaded the doleful days to come,
			-
		-
			Verse 3154
		-
			-
				deaths enow, and doom of battle,
			-
		-
			Verse 3155
		-
			-
				and shame. - The smoke by the sky was devoured.
			-
		-
			Verse 3156
		-
			-
				The folk of the Weders fashioned there
			-
		-
			Verse 3157
		-
			-
				on the headland a barrow broad and high,
			-
		-
			Verse 3158
		-
			-
				by ocean-farers far descried:
			-
		-
			Verse 3159
		-
			-
				in ten days' time their toil had raised it,
			-
		-
			Verse 3160
		-
			-
				the battle-brave's beacon. Round brands of the pyre
			-
		-
			Verse 3161
		-
			-
				a wall they built, the worthiest ever
			-
		-
			Verse 3162
		-
			-
				that wit could prompt in their wisest men.
			-
		-
			Verse 3163
		-
			-
				They placed in the barrow that precious booty,
			-
		-
			Verse 3164
		-
			-
				the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,
			-
		-
			Verse 3165
		-
			-
				hardy heroes, from hoard in cave, -
			-
		-
			Verse 3166
		-
			-
				trusting the ground with treasure of earls,
			-
		-
			Verse 3167
		-
			-
				gold in the earth, where ever it lies
			-
		-
			Verse 3168
		-
			-
				useless to men as of yore it was.
			-
		-
			Verse 3169
		-
			-
				Then about that barrow the battle-keen rode,
			-
		-
			Verse 3170
		-
			-
				atheling-born, a band of twelve,
			-
		-
			Verse 3171
		-
			-
				lament to make, to mourn their king,
			-
		-
			Verse 3172
		-
			-
				chant their dirge, and their chieftain honor.
			-
		-
			Verse 3173
		-
			-
				They praised his earlship, his acts of prowess
			-
		-
			Verse 3174
		-
			-
				worthily witnessed: and well it is
			-
		-
			Verse 3175
		-
			-
				that men their master-friend mightily laud,
			-
		-
			Verse 3176
		-
			-
				heartily love, when hence he goes
			-
		-
			Verse 3177
		-
			-
				from life in the body forlorn away.
			-
		-
			Verse 3178
		-
			-
				Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland,
			-
		-
			Verse 3179
		-
			-
				for their hero's passing his hearth-companions:
			-
		-
			Verse 3180
		-
			-
				quoth that of all the kings of earth,
			-
		-
			Verse 3181
		-
			-
				of men he was mildest and most beloved,
			-
		-
			Verse 3182
		-
			-
				to his kin the kindest, keenest for praise.
